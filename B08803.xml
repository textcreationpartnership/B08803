            <title>Several discourses concerning the actual Providence of God. Divided into three parts. The first, treating concerning the notion of it, establshing the doctrine of it, opening the principal acts of it, preservation and government of created beings. With the particular acts, by which it so preserveth and governeth them.  The second, concerning the specialities of it, the unseachable things of it, and several observable things in its motions.  The third, concerning the dysnoēta, or hard chapters of it, in which an attempt is made to solve several appearances of difficulty in the motions of Providence, and to vindicate the justice, wisdom, and holiness of God, with the reasonableness of his dealing in such motions. / By John Collinges ...</title>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Beſeech your <hi>Honour</hi> to believe me telling you, that I have been theſe thirteen years (ever ſince I had the happineſs to know your Ladiſhip) watching an opportunity, as to let your Ladiſhip know the ſenſe I have of the obligations you have been pleaſed to lay upon me; ſo to let the world know the <hi>honour</hi> I have for your <hi>Ladiſhip,</hi> growing up from my firſt <hi>obſervations</hi> of you, which was in your <hi>Ladiſhips</hi> near <hi>approaches</hi> to, and in your ſtate of <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood.</hi> I then obſerved, <hi>Madam,</hi> that your <hi>Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> (like the child of ſo <hi>Honourable</hi> and pious Parents) had very early entertained <hi>just, noble,</hi> and moſt <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thoughts of the living God,</hi> which had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in you as early a <hi>choice of him as your God,</hi> and of <hi>his ways,</hi> as <hi>your ways,</hi> with a <hi>zeal</hi> beyond the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which could be expected from your years. Having therefore perfected the following Diſcourſes, I congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated my ſelf, when I had thought of your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> as a fit perſon to entitle to them, and the rather, becauſe your Ladiſhip (having not yet ſeen many years) ſhall I hope have many days to obſerve the motions of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence,</hi> both as to <hi>Polities</hi> and <hi>Perſons;</hi> and from thence both to conclude, how true thoſe few <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations</hi> are which I have made, and to give ſome more eminent Divine, many a ſubject more of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from your own <hi>obſervation. Madam!</hi> in the few years you have yet lived, you have ſeen as many, and as quick, and inexpected <hi>rotations of Providence;</hi> as
<pb facs="tcp:192227:4"/>the like number of years have at any time as yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, or are like to produce; and yet the wheel ſeems to run nimbly, and a further multitude of years may add to your <hi>Ladiſhips wiſdom</hi> in this thing. I crave leave moſt humbly to recommend to your <hi>Honour,</hi> as the obſervation of <hi>Iſſues,</hi> ſo the confirmation of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Promiſes,</hi> and <hi>Threatnings</hi> in the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of them. I doubt not but your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> will every day ſee, that it is <hi>that God who cannot lye,</hi> who hath commanded his Miniſters at all times to <hi>ſay unto the righteous, it ſhall be well with them, for they ſhall eat of the fruit of their doings;</hi> and to ſay, <hi>Wo unto the wicked it ſhall be ill with them, for the reward of their hands ſhall be given them.</hi> If <hi>Madam!</hi> the <hi>actual Providence of God</hi> at any time ſeemeth to look another way, it is but keeping your patient foot a while at the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> (like the <hi>Bee</hi>) will come home to the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Promiſe</hi> or <hi>Threatning,</hi> bringing along with it a body <hi>laden with honey,</hi> to reward the godly and righteous man, and a ſting to <hi>ſmite</hi> and pierce thoſe through who have wrought wickedneſs, and provoked a jealous God. Our bleſſed Lord <hi>(Madam)</hi> tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>That it is life eternal for men to know God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent.</hi> The promiſe or predication in the propoſition of that Text, makes it evident that by the <hi>knowledg of the Father,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> is meant more than the bare comprehenſion of the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>things of God</hi> in our <hi>understanding</hi> (as indeed knowledg and moſt other terms of ſenſe do ordinarily ſignifie in Scripture, the <hi>Greek</hi> complying with its elder ſiſter the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which hath a great penury of words) ſo that to <hi>know God</hi> and Chriſt in the true ſenſe of that <hi>text,</hi> is not only in our underſtandings to comprehend what may be, and is neceſſary to be known of God; but to
<pb facs="tcp:192227:4"/>
               <hi>adore, love, fear</hi> him, <hi>believe in him,</hi> to chuſe him for our God. In ſhort it comprehends all thoſe acts of our minds which are either juſt conſequents, or may rationally be inferred as duties from a juſt underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and due comprehenſion of him; but in regard according to the workings of our reaſonable natures thoſe acts will not, indeed cannot be exerted, without a praevious apprehenſion of him proportionable to what he indeed is, and ſo as to make him an adequate object for our <hi>affections,</hi> a juſt comprehenſion of God in our underſtandings is neceſſary, in order to thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts of internal homage, wherein the Creature ſtandeth indebted to his great Creator. So that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Prov. 19.2. did but conclude rationally, <hi>That the ſoul ſhould be without knowledg is not good.</hi> And the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles askt but a reaſonable queſtion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>How ſhall they believe on him of whom they have not heard?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Knowledg comes into the Soul either by the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ſenſes,</hi> or by <hi>reaſoning</hi> and diſcourſe; or thirdly by <hi>Divine impreſſion and revelation.</hi> The two former are the more ordinary; the latter, a rarer and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary means of knowledg, in theſe latter days, ſince God hath <hi>ſpoken to us by his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpeak of Knowledg ſtrictly taken for the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of things in our underſtanding, for if we take it in the large ſenſe even now mentioned, neither ſenſe, nor reaſon, is a ſufficient mean to it.</p>
            <p>By <hi>ſenſe</hi> we can directly comprehend nothing of God, for who hath ſeen him at any time? he is an Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, immaterial ſubſtance, and cometh not under the cogniſance of any ſenſe, nor indeed can we ſo know any ſpiritual being; but in regard the effects both of him who is the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> and of <hi>ſpiritual beings</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:192227:5"/>that are creatures are ſenſible. Our Senſes afford us oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an auxiliary help, from which our reaſon draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth juſt concluſions concerning God, from Principles which it at firſt it eſtabliſheth by the help of <hi>ſenſe.</hi> For example, That the <hi>World</hi> is, and <hi>Man</hi> is, are matters of ſenſe. Now Reaſon concludes, <hi>Nothing</hi> (unleſs a firſt being) <hi>can be the cauſe of its own existence.</hi> Hence it gathers there muſt be a <hi>God,</hi> a <hi>first being,</hi> and a <hi>first cauſe.</hi> Again, when Senſe hath ſhewed us <hi>Man</hi> a <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature,</hi> Reaſon works and tells us, <hi>He that made this noble Creature must needs be more noble, more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, more excellent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What we know then of God muſt needs be from <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Revelation.</hi> Reaſon brings us in knowledg, by raiſing <hi>Concluſions</hi> from <hi>Principles.</hi> Theſe Principles are of two ſorts, <hi>Philoſophical,</hi> or <hi>Scriptural.</hi> I call thoſe <hi>Philoſophical Principles,</hi> which reaſon as it now reſideth in us juſtifieth, and which without the <hi>help of the Word of God</hi> are allowed by all; or the moſt of men, eſpecially if cultivated by any ingenuous education, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either <hi>common natural principles,</hi> or ſuch as are eſtabliſhed by ſtudies upon deliberate thoughts, with the help of ſenſe, and improvement of diſcourſe and ratiocination. Thus Reaſon will tell us that there is a <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>one God;</hi> That <hi>he must be</hi> the firſt <hi>being,</hi> the <hi>first cauſe,</hi> more excellent in the perfections of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than any creature; and an hundred things of a like evidence. Or elſe it concludeth from <hi>revealed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> (having firſt a ſufficient evidence, <hi>That the holy Scriptures are the word of God, who cannot ſpeak falſly.</hi>) Theſe Principles now are ſuch propoſitions as without the ſurer word of Propheſie we could never have had any juſt evidence of: Such now are the Doctrines of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> The <hi>Incarnation of Chriſt,</hi> The <hi>Perſonal union
<pb facs="tcp:192227:5"/>of the Divine and Humane Nature in him;</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>In the diſcovery and juſtification of ſuch Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Reaſon gathereth from the firſt ſort of Principles, lyeth the work of a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> as a Philoſopher. In the diſcovery and proof of ſuch Propoſitions as are partly evidenced from Reaſon, but more fully from Scripture, lies the work of a <hi>Chriſtian Philoſopher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the diſcovery, proving and applying of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions as have their Evidence partly from Reaſon, and more fully from <hi>holy Writ,</hi> or as cannot be at all concluded, unleſs building upon Scriptural foundations, but are founded in Scripture, and may be illuſtrated im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly from reaſon, and ſhewed not to be improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor unreaſonable, lyes the work of the Miniſter of the Goſpel, who is to convey the knowledg of God to his people. And the true reaſon why ſome even of theſe ſilver Trumpets (which belong to the Sanctuary) give an <hi>incertain ſound,</hi> is becauſe neither the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>natural Reaſon,</hi> nor <hi>Revelation,</hi> appear to all men in the ſame <hi>light.</hi> We ſay, <hi>The beſt Philoſopher is not as yet born.</hi> Our age tells us how generally Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Philoſophy are exploded (and it may be ſome of them juſtly too) which we when we were boys thought to lye very near <hi>Demonſtration;</hi> and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the next age ſomething now admitted, will be judged as faulty. It hath pleaſed God to ſubject our underſtandings to this vanity. Now we having no way (unleſs God would from Heaven ſpeak to us) to know any propoſition of Truth, but from the exerciſe of our Reaſon concluding, either from Principles purely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or from Propoſitions of <hi>Revelation</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> every one naturally judging himſelf obliged to believe, according to the evidence he hath from his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb facs="tcp:192227:6"/>there muſt and will be different apprehenſions until (which will never be) men have all either the ſame degrees of <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Scriptural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;</hi> which will be advantaged if there be any who think that all Propoſitions are to be weighed by the <hi>bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance</hi> of <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> and that the holy Scripture as to the ſenſe of it muſt come into that <hi>ſcale,</hi> and make but in-weight giving only an auxiliary help to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the moſt <hi>ſublime Propoſitions</hi> of truth. Nor is there any help for this. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which your Ladiſhip knows pretends to wondrous Miracles) hath indeed deviſed a <hi>palliating</hi> cure for this, ſetting up an <hi>Infallible cheat</hi> to judg of <hi>all Controverſies,</hi> and by <hi>fire and faggots,</hi> and all barbarous <hi>cruelties,</hi> and <hi>inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manities</hi> forcing men to acquieſce in the <hi>Deciſions</hi> of that <hi>ridiculous Judg.</hi> But in the mean time mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences apprehend themſelves before one who is no <hi>Judg</hi> in the eaſe, and the ſore feſtreth and rotteth to the bone; for the <hi>Pope</hi> can make none to alter his mind. And a little reaſon might tell the <hi>Quacks</hi> of that Colledg, that if it be not in the power of a man to <hi>believe what he hath a mind to believe,</hi> it is much leſs in the power of a foreign power to compell him to it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> cure is certainly more <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>reaſonable,</hi> yea and more <hi>Apostolical</hi> too. They ſet forth <hi>ſums of ſound Doctrine,</hi> to which they only annex that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Let us therefore (as many as be perfect) be thus minded, and if any in any thing be otherwiſe minded God ſhall reveal even this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi> Only <hi>Proteſtants</hi> require (as the ſame Apoſtle directs) <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. That if any hath a <hi>particular faith,</hi> (different from that of the Church wherein he liveth) <hi>he ſhould have it to himſelf before God.</hi> Thus the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God</hi> is acquired from his word, reading it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:192227:6"/>Catechiſed out of it, hearing it opened, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, by the <hi>comparing of ſpiritual things with ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;</hi> by the uſe of reaſon and diſcourſe in the <hi>Velitation of Queſtions</hi> ariſing from the ſeeming contradictions in Holy Writ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is alſo another mean of <hi>Divine Knowledg,</hi> that is by his <hi>exterior works,</hi> by which much of the Knowledg of God is <hi>gained, improved,</hi> and <hi>encreaſed.</hi> Theſe works are either of <hi>Creation,</hi> or of <hi>Providence.</hi> Creation was the work of the firſt ſix days, from which God hath ceaſed long ſince, but the things created re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and much of the Knowledg of God is to be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence, by the help of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> which ſheweth us the things, and <hi>reaſon</hi> which helpeth us to conclude, that there being ſo many noble effects, there muſt be a <hi>firſt</hi> and more noble cauſe; there being ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Beings, there muſt be a <hi>firſt</hi> and moſt perfect and <hi>excellent Being.</hi> Nothing created could give an Exiſtence to it ſelf: Hence the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>That the inviſible things of God from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen from the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1.20. <hi>So that they are without excuſe, becauſe that when they knew God they glorified him not as God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Book of Scriptures</hi> we (bleſſed be God!) have it in our Vernacular Tongue, we have means to teach us to read, we have <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> and <hi>Confeſſions of Faith,</hi> containing the <hi>Epitome</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of them, we have the various labours of holy and learned men, to make us to underſtand them; ſcarce any thing ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be wanting to this age for the gaining of this <hi>excellent knowledg</hi> by this mean but perſons giving themſelves up to <hi>Reading, Hearing, Meditation, Chriſtian Conferences,</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:192227:7"/>
            <p>For the <hi>Book of Creation</hi> methinks it is like a great <hi>Bible</hi> in ſome <hi>Religious Gentlemans</hi> Hall, that lyes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways open; we cannot move a ſtep in the world, nor lift up an eye to Heaven, but our eye is upon one page, or another of it. If men will not read the <hi>Wiſdom of God,</hi> in the ſagacity and wiſdom of ſome Creatures, nor the power and greatneſs of God in the <hi>greatneſs and power</hi> of others, and ſo for other perfections; it is not becauſe they want means, but becauſe they want an heart to ſeek after God: as to this there is no want of any thing, but a wiſe contemplation of them, and a rational concluding from the perfections of the effects to the greater excellency and perfection of the firſt <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>being.</hi> The Book of Creation will learn us much of the nature and admirable perfections of the Divine Being. The Book of Scripture will learn us more of it, and inſtruct us in ſublimer Myſteries than Reaſon could diſcover: <hi>The Doctrine of the Trinity;</hi> the <hi>two Natures united in the Perſon of the Mediator.</hi> They will tell us of Gods Covenants, of Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the <hi>Covenant of Redemption,</hi> of the <hi>Will of God</hi> to be done by us, and the Will of God to be done unto, and upon us, in his <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>threatnings.</hi> The Apoſtle ſums up all, when he tells us <hi>they are able to make the man of God wiſe to ſalvation, throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is yet another Book which is leſs obvious to the <hi>eye of ſenſe,</hi> than the Book of Creation is, and to the eye of Reaſon too, and upon which fewer <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries</hi> have been wrote, than upon the <hi>Books of holy Scripture,</hi> that is the Book of <hi>Actual Providence.</hi> A Book in which much of God is written, and from which much of God may be learned; but it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken for the <hi>Viſion of a book that is ſealed, which is
<pb facs="tcp:192227:7"/>given to one who is learned,</hi> with a command to <hi>read it,</hi> but he ſaith, <hi>I cannot, for it is ſealed.</hi> Some (more bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh than the Heathens) deny any ſuch Book, dreaming of the old Pagan <hi>Fate,</hi> or <hi>blind Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others will allow it in part, but will have much of it ſpurious, dreaming that the World is like a <hi>Clock,</hi> which once ſet in order and wound up, goes alone without further uſe of the Workmans hand. Others will allow Divine Providence a more univerſal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but yet love not to hear of any <hi>Specialties</hi> of it. Some again highly conceited of their own reaſon, will ſubject the Providence of God to their rational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. Few or none make any <hi>obſervations</hi> upon the motions of Divine Providence; though certainly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more conduceth to true Spiritual wiſdom. Others ſtumbling at ſome <hi>difficulties</hi> relating to the motions of Providence, either wholly deny it, or form to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtrange <hi>Ideas</hi> of God, which no way agree to his moſt holy and perfect eſſence.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Madam!</hi> hath encouraged me to attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing both to recover the <hi>Actual Providence</hi> of God, from the <hi>Atheiſm</hi> of this age, and the groundleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices which vain men have taken up againſt it; and by it to recover for God, that juſt <hi>Fear, Faith, Love, Patience,</hi> and other homage, which both the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his <hi>being,</hi> and of his holy working calleth for. And certainly, <hi>Madam,</hi> if learned men have thought it worth their while (as ſome have done) to give the World a rational account of <hi>Divine Offices,</hi> of the <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>circumſtances</hi> of <hi>Eccleſtastical constitutions</hi> in Rites and Garments, Liturgies and Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It muſt needs be a <hi>noble work,</hi> to undertake to give the world a <hi>Rational</hi> of <hi>Divine Operations.</hi> Such eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which ſeem to be the hardeſt Chapters in the
<pb facs="tcp:192227:8"/>book of Providence, and leaſt eaſie to be underſtood; and indeed this was my <hi>original deſign.</hi> But while my thoughts were exerciſed in this, my work grew upon my hand, conſidering eſpecially the <hi>Atheiſm</hi> of the age in which we live, together with the circumſtances of the Church and people of God in moſt <hi>European</hi> parts of the world, and the particular <hi>temptations</hi> I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved attending many, and thoſe very excellent perſons. I was further drawn on by the <hi>pleaſantneſs and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the ſubject in all, but eſpecially in evil times, and the apparent tendency of it to make men fear, and love, hope and truſt in, and with patience to wait upon God. Theſe things, <hi>Madam,</hi> made me reſolve to open the Doctrine of Providence more fully, though not in its full compaſs, and latitude (reſolving always to carry along with me the capacity of thoſe to whom I ſpake or wrote.) I was, <hi>Madam,</hi> the more encouraged in this from my obſervation, that amongſt the many excellent Books with which this age doth abound, there are fewer of this Argument than any other. Mr. <hi>Obadiah Sedgwick</hi> (a great Divine) treats in two or three Sermons about the <hi>Specialties of Providence,</hi> and the late eminent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> hath in a ſhort Tract learnedly and piouſly diſcourſed the <hi>ſymmetry</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of it. Another in a larger Diſcourſe called an <hi>Introduction into the Doctrine of Providence,</hi> hath made and a little enlarged upon <hi>ſeveral Obſervations</hi> upon the motions of it. I project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and have at laſt finiſhed a fuller Diſcourſe than any of theſe (though poſſibly much more imperfect ſo far as they did diſcourſe this excellent argument) and reſolved to divide my diſcourſe into three parts, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly I have done.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Part, <hi>Madam,</hi> after two Preliminary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; the firſt concerning Gods <hi>Predeterminations,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:192227:8"/>(where I had no mind to meddle with any preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, that was not a popular work,) the ſecond concerning <hi>Creation;</hi> Your Ldiſhip will find me plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſing of the <hi>Nature of Providence,</hi> in the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which alone I intended to ſpeak to it. There I have from Scripture and Reaſon proved, That there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant care of God extended to the whole <hi>Creation:</hi> That the Creature ſtands not in its own ſtrength, nor moveth meerly from a principle within it ſelf; nor is governed meerly by its fellow-creatures in a ſuperior order, much leſs acteth <hi>caſually,</hi> or under the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of any fate; but is under the daily <hi>inſpection, government, care</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi> of the <hi>firſt cauſe,</hi> its great Creator, who both <hi>preſerveth</hi> and <hi>governeth it.</hi> There I have ſhortly ſhewed the particular acts by which God preſerveth and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth created Beings in their ſeveral capacities: A point, <hi>Madam,</hi> of inexpreſſible uſe, to poſſeſs us of a true notion of God, of our daily dependencies upon him, and (conſequently) our duty toward him. <hi>David</hi> ſaith he was <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made;</hi> we are <hi>fearfully and wonderfully preſerved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond Part I have diſcourſed 1. Of the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialties of Providence,</hi> more eſpecially to the Church, and to every individual ſoul that loves and fears him, ſhortly opening wherein they lye, and ſhewing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of it. 2. Then I more ſhortly diſcourſe the <hi>unſearchable things of it;</hi> for <hi>Madam,</hi> who dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend more than to ſhew a <hi>part of his ways? Who can by ſearching find out God? Who can find out the Almighty to Perfection?</hi> This I have done to check <hi>curioſity,</hi> and keep off good people from vain gueſſes and Prophetical concluſions without bottom. 3. From that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will lead your Ladiſhip to conſider the duty of a good Chriſtian, in the obſervation of the motions of
<pb facs="tcp:192227:9"/>Providence, and the advantage from it reſulting to an obſerving ſoul. To help my Reader in this I have made <hi>ſeveral obſervations upon the motions of Providence.</hi> Some of which lie plain enough to every eye, all I think are juſtified enough from Scriptural and other inſtances, only perhaps the reaſonableneſs and juſtice, and wiſdom of God in them, is not or hath not been ſo obvious. Others (poſſibly) have not been ſo remarked, and are little more than recommended as <hi>probationers</hi> for a good mans obſervation.</p>
            <p>There is, <hi>Madam,</hi> a great variety in the methods of an infinitely wiſe God by which he ordereth the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and particularly that people in the world which he hath ſet apart for himſelf, In the ſame work Gods Providence moveth not at all times in the ſame method, or by the ſame means, yet in many things the motions of Providence have much uniformity if we wiſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them.</p>
            <p>And as from the reading, and obſervation of the <hi>Syntax</hi> and <hi>conſtruction</hi> uſed by Authors in ſeveral lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, Grammarians have made their obſervations, from whence they have formed <hi>Rules,</hi> few of which are yet without their exceptions: ſo from the obſervation of the motions of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> in the world; the reading of the Sacred Hiſtory, and conſidering what the great God hath been doing, and is doing in the world; conſiderate Chriſtians may gain a great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God in his ways, and give a very probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, if not form a certain judgment, both what God is about to do, and what <hi>Iſrael ought to do. For</hi> (ſaith the Wiſeman, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.9, 10.) <hi>the thing which hath been it is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing under the Sun. Is there any thing of which it may be ſaid, ſee this is new? it hath been already of old time which was
<pb facs="tcp:192227:9"/>before us.</hi> The Sinners of the world are but acting over thoſe luſts of hatred to God, malice, revenge, cruelty, luxury, which their forefathers periſhed in acting many years ago. And the Saints in the world are but making the ſame <hi>defence,</hi> fighting the <hi>ſame good fight,</hi> finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame courſe which <hi>Abel</hi> began in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was carried on by <hi>Elijah, Zachariah,</hi> and all the Prophets, by <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and the <hi>Captain of our Salvation;</hi> and Gods motions of Providence will appear much the ſame: as to circumſtances of time and place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they may alter, but ſubſtantially they muſt be ſo, becauſe of the certainty of the word both of <hi>promiſe,</hi> and <hi>threatning.</hi> The ſtudy of <hi>Actual Providence</hi> (for which the Hiſtorical part of the Scripture which we count moſt uſeleſs, is of great uſe) is a noble ſtudy, and the obſervation of the daily motions of it, is highly conducive to make us ſpiritually wiſe, and to help us to underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord, both towards his Church, and individual ſouls which love and fear him. I have, <hi>Madam,</hi> been ſomething large in theſe obſervations, but yet how little a portion of Gods ways have I here diſplayed? I ſhall yet think I have done a great work, if I have but ſet an example to ſome other Divines of greater parts, knowledg, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and obſervation, to carry it on, for doubtleſs, many more obſervations might be made, which would both much increaſe our knowledg, and direct our practice.</p>
            <p>In the third and laſt part of my Diſcourſes, <hi>Madam,</hi> I have endeavoured to expound ſome difficult Chapters in the <hi>book of Providence,</hi> and to deliver the name of that glorious God, whom we ſerve, from thoſe prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which nothing but the luſts of men have raiſed in the world againſt him, and his righteous ways. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
<pb facs="tcp:192227:10"/>the ways of Divine Providence both to thoſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> of truth, which lye plain in the word, and to thoſe Promiſes and Threatnings which are the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his will in that word, both with reference to Saints and Sinners.</p>
            <p>I think, <hi>Madam,</hi> I diſcern two great Errors in the world: 1. The Judgment of Truth. 2. Of the love and hatred of God from motions and iſſues of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> Hence becauſe God in his Providence hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Production of Men and Women, giving them life and being, and his Goſpel to be preached in their hearing; ſo as they are externally called to repent and to believe, men conclude, <hi>There is no election of perſons, That Chriſt hath died for all and every man;</hi> That every <hi>man hath a power to repent, believe, love God, hate ſin, &amp;c.</hi> And I wiſh a modeſt denial of Divine Truths were the worſt: but we are fallen into a <hi>rude</hi> and ill manner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed age, when every puny hath boldneſs enough to ſay, If this be ſo, then <hi>God is an impostor,</hi> and mocks and deludes, he is <hi>unjust, cruel.</hi> I tremble to recite it; when-as the truth is, it is neither <hi>ſo</hi> nor <hi>ſo.</hi> Let what will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded concerning theſe Propoſitions, no ſuch thing will follow. I have, <hi>Madam,</hi> endeavoured to reconcile theſe Providences of God to the truth of theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſome invidiouſly charge with ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and to let theſe bold men underſtand that God is equal, his ways equal, and admirably corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding with thoſe notions of truth ſo much diſtaſt them; only they are ignorant, and do not rightly judg concerning a righteous God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Error is more common: <hi>The judging of the love and hatred of God from his Providential diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations to us.</hi> Hence are our <hi>temptations</hi> to call the
<pb facs="tcp:192227:10"/>
               <hi>proud happy,</hi> to bleſs them whom the Lord hath curſed, and becauſe they are rich and proſper; and as to our ſelves, to charge God fooliſhly, as if either he did not deal juſtly or kindly with us, becauſe we are tempted or afflicted more than others, or becauſe we are devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by wicked men.</p>
            <p>I have, <hi>Madam,</hi> attempted to remove theſe ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks out of the ways of Gods people, and to reconcile both theſe motions of Providence, and all its motions in the diſpenſations both of <hi>first</hi> and <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace,</hi> to his <hi>Wiſdom, Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and to our reaſon; as alſo to reconcile Gods Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial permiſſions of ſin, and ſinners, his puniſhment of one ſin with another, to the purity and <hi>holineſs of God;</hi> and to deliver Gods Providential diſpenſations of this nature from the uſual and ignorant imputation, that <hi>this is to make God the author of ſin;</hi> what I have done of this nature, I leave to your <hi>Ladiſhip,</hi> and every ſober <hi>Reader</hi> to judg. The whole, <hi>Madam,</hi> was compoſed for <hi>popular diſcourſes.</hi> Thoſe that dwell in Kings houſes may be allowed perhaps to cloth their Diſcourſes in the <hi>ſoft raiment</hi> of fine and delicate words. It was not ſo fit for me who was to ſpeak of great things to a plain people, and whoſe deſign was that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> not to have the faith of thoſe to whom I ſpake, ſtand tottering upon the wiſdom of men (which varieth much in <hi>individuals</hi>) but <hi>in the power of God.</hi> I am far from thinking theſe Diſcourſes perfect in any part of them. I have laid the foundation, God raiſe up wiſe and maſter-builders to ſuperſtruct. If I miſtake not, the foundation I have laid, is not upon the <hi>ſand,</hi> and uncertain bottom of humane reaſon, but upon the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets, Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> I moſt humbly beg pardon of your <hi>Ladiſhip</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:192227:11"/>
               <hi>noble Husband,</hi> for no further taking notice of him in this Epiſtle. I had not, when I wrote it, <hi>knowledg</hi> enough of him to entitle me to ſuch a preſumption; I now ſo far know him, as to let me know he will not be diſguſted at what is offered to your <hi>Ladiſhip;</hi> and to aſſure me, he is one who owneth and adoreth <hi>Divine Providence;</hi> and if he had no other <hi>motives,</hi> I pretty well am aſſured alſo that its <hi>diſpenſation</hi> towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in diſpoſing ſuch a <hi>Lady</hi> to his boſom, and making him ſuch a <hi>Father in our Iſrael,</hi> by your <hi>Ladiſhip,</hi> as he is, and I truſt ſhall further be, would be ſufficient. I moſt humbly beg, <hi>Madam,</hi> all the <hi>Bleſſings of Heaven and Earth</hi> upon him, and upon your <hi>Ladiſhip,</hi> and all thoſe whom God hath given you, and crave the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

Epheſus</hi> was a City in the lower <hi>Aſia:</hi> A City famous for Trade, and as famous for their Idolatrous Worſhip of the great <hi>Goddeſs Diana. Paul</hi> came thither, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.19, 20. but tarried not, being to <hi>keep the feaſt at Hieruſalem,</hi> Acts 19. You find him returned thither, where he ſtayeth <hi>two years</hi> and <hi>three months,</hi> as you may gather from <hi>Acts</hi> 20. You may in that Chapter find him forced thence by an uproar of the people; during the time of his abode there, God uſed him to plant a <hi>Goſpel-Church.</hi> He left the charge of it with <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. <hi>As I beſought thee to abide ſtill at Epheſus,</hi> while I went into <hi>Macedonia.</hi> We cannot gather from any thing in this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> that any ſuch corruptions in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> or manners had crept into this Church, as had done into the Churches of <hi>Rome, Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Galatia;</hi> but the bleſſed Apoſtle knew, that although they ſtood, they were concerned to <hi>take heed leſt they fell,</hi> and that the common temptations of thoſe times might influence them; to obviate which he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this Epiſtle unto them. In the Preface contained in the two firſt verſes, he after his manner ſaluteth them. In the third verſe he begins the matter of his Epiſtle, minding them of the wonderful benefits, and acts of Grace, which God had made them partakers of, in, and <hi>through Chriſt.</hi> He inſtanceth in the <hi>Election</hi> of them to eternal life, as the end, and the <hi>Predeſtination</hi> of them to the means in order to that end, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. Thence he proceedeth to a diſcourſe about <hi>Redemption, verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10. In this Verſe he returneth again to the buſineſs of <hi>Predeſtination. In whom alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we have received an inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him. — Who worketh all things according to the counſel of his will.</hi> Where you have two things affirmed concerning God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That God worketh all things.</hi> As he at firſt created <hi>all things,</hi> ſo he <hi>worketh all things;</hi> ſome by way of <hi>Efficiency,</hi> and ſpecial influence, others by way of <hi>Permiſſion;</hi> or he worketh all things, whatſoever is not ſinful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That he doth it according to the counſel of his will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am aware, that there are ſome <hi>Divines,</hi> who reſtrain the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Particle <hi>all things,</hi> to the <hi>things before ſpoken of,</hi> or at leaſt to <hi>all thoſe things</hi> which God worketh in a way of <hi>Efficiency.</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:192227:16"/>The latter is <hi>Bellarmine's ſenſe,</hi> for which he quoteth <hi>Hierome.</hi> I do rather encline to thoſe Interpreters, who think, <hi>all things,</hi> are to be interpreted more generally. Nor is there any fear, that by this interpretation we ſhould make God the <hi>Author of ſin:</hi> for beſides that, after <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had ſpit his Venom againſt <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bellar. de amiſſ. Gratiae &amp; ſtatu peccati,</hi> cap. 15.</note> he could find out a way himſelf to entitle God to <hi>all things,</hi> yet not to ſin; for he tells us right, <hi>Peccatum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere eſt deficere;</hi> certainly all <hi>actions</hi> as things, or <hi>natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> muſt be from him, <hi>in whom we live, move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> though the <hi>irregularity, obliquity, malice and deformity, and crookedneſs of actions</hi> (in which alone lyes the ſinfulneſs of them) is not <hi>from God,</hi> but from the <hi>corruption</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> of the <hi>ſinners hearts.</hi> Now the very <hi>eſſe formale</hi> of ſin (if it be not improper to ſay ſo) lyeth not in the <hi>natural action,</hi> but in the <hi>obliquity</hi> and <hi>deviation</hi> of the <hi>action</hi> from the <hi>Divine rule;</hi> and this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Calvin</hi> nor <hi>Beza,</hi> nor any valuable perſon, ever aſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. And therefore the <hi>All things</hi> of the Text may ſafely be underſtood, of all <hi>beings, natural motions and actions,</hi> and to entitle God to them, is no more than to ſay after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>In him we live and move, and have our being.</hi> Now the Text doth not only ſay, <hi>That God worketh all things,</hi> but that he worketh all things <hi>according to the counſel of his will,</hi> that is, an <hi>eternal Decree</hi> made in infinite wiſdom. So that two Propoſitions are plain enough in the Text, 1. <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe. Nothing hath come to paſs, nor ever ſhall, but what the <hi>will and counſel of God</hi> hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined, <hi>that it ſhall be;</hi> obſerve that phraſe, <hi>That it ſhall be.</hi> There are many things have been done, and are every day <hi>done,</hi> or <hi>doing</hi> in the world, which the <hi>purity and holineſs of God,</hi> will allow him to have <hi>no efficiency in;</hi> but there is no <hi>effect</hi> which he hath not <hi>willed ſhould be done.</hi> Indeed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>means,</hi> the primary efficient, or inſtrumental cauſes of actions, <hi>Gods VVill</hi> hath moved variouſly. For all <hi>good things, motions,</hi> or <hi>actions</hi> that have <hi>any goodneſs</hi> in them, himſelf hath willed to do 'em, and to concur as a <hi>principal efficient cauſe.</hi> The A poſtle telleth us, that <hi>every good and perfect gift cometh down from above,</hi> which is not only true of <hi>ſpiritual gifts, habits,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:192227:17"/>and <hi>influences,</hi> but of <hi>natural actions</hi> and <hi>motions,</hi> ſuch as are purely ſo, and abſtractly conſidered from any <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or irregularity cleaving to them; for the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>In him we live and move.</hi> Now whereas all <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> are either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil;</hi> as to the firſt, it is readily granted, the <hi>firſt mover</hi> muſt be the <hi>efficient of motions.</hi> God is the <hi>fountain and original of all good.</hi> And in this ſenſe that of our Saviour is true, <hi>There is none good but God.</hi> There is a <hi>goodneſs</hi> in <hi>natural habits and actions,</hi> a goodneſs of <hi>being</hi> conſidering the motions and actions purely as <hi>natural,</hi> without the tincture of a <hi>vitiated will,</hi> or <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>paſſions debauched.</hi> There is a further goodneſs in <hi>ſpiritual habits and actions.</hi> All is from God, and concerning every good <hi>action</hi> or <hi>motion</hi> in either ſenſe, there hath paſſed an <hi>eternal purpoſe or counſel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The only doubt can be, is concerning <hi>evil actions</hi> vitiated from the <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>debauched will, and affections and paſſions of men.</hi> As to which it is on all hands moſt readily granted, <hi>That God is not the author of them as ſuch, nor willed to effect them;</hi> he hath neither commanded them, nor approved them, but he hath <hi>willed</hi> that theſe <hi>ſhould be done,</hi> he hath willed the <hi>permiſſion of them.</hi> And this is ſo evident, both from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> raiſing concluſions from <hi>ſcriptural principles,</hi> that it can with no modeſty be denied. I will prove it but from one inſtance of Scripture, but that ſo high as nothing can be higher, and ſo plainly aſſerted, as nothing can be plainer. You ſhall find it <hi>Acts</hi> 4.27,
<note place="margin">Acts 4.27, 28.</note> 28. <hi>For of a truth againſt thy holy child Jeſus, whom thou haſt anointed, both Herod, and Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the children of Iſrael were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, for to do whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined before to be done.</hi> There certainly never was, nor is it poſſible there ever ſhould be, an higher act of wickedneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the world, than the <hi>adjudging to death,</hi> and <hi>crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who was the eternal Son of God, and the moſt juſt and righteous perſon that ever was in the world. There was a great <hi>Combination,</hi> as to this <hi>murther, Herod, Pontius Pilate, Judas,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles: Judas</hi> betrayed him, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> mock't him, <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> condemned him, the <hi>Jews</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles crucified him.</hi> They all did their highly ſinful parts. Now one would think, and may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conclude, that if there ever had been, or could have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:192227:17"/>been, an action done in the world, which had ſlipped the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal will, and counſel of God,</hi> and come to paſs whiles the <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Iſrael had been aſleep,</hi> or which God never thought on, it ſhould have been <hi>this action.</hi> But, ſaith the Apoſtle, they all in this <hi>act,</hi> this horrid act, did no more than what <hi>Gods hand and counſel had before determined to be done.</hi> The words are <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Gods <hi>Counſel</hi> determined not to do it, but <hi>that it ſhould be done.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is often uſed in holy writ, and uſually it is tranſlated <hi>predeſtinated,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 5. of this Chapter, and in my Text; and ſo alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Whom he predeſtinated;</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. it is tranſlated <hi>ordained.</hi> It apparently ſignifieth a Predetermination of perſons, or things, and is uſed with reference to both, and that both as to <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> things. I ſhall only further give you the note of a very great Divine upon it, that it ſignifieth ſuch a Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of things, as not only comprehendeth <hi>the end,</hi> but the <hi>means</hi> leading to that end. But in a further evidence of this, let us uſe our reaſon a little, though ſtill exerciſing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſcriptural Principles. My firſt argument ſhall be,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, From Gods certain fore-knowledg of all things.</hi> I will open it in three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God from all eternity did certainly and infallibly foreknow whatſoever ſhould come to paſs in the world.</hi> The holy Scripture is very plentiful in aſſerting the perfection of the Divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.21. <hi>The ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all their goings.</hi> Prov. 15.3. <hi>His eyes are everywhere beholding the evil and the good.</hi> Pſal. 139.3. <hi>Thou art acquainted with all my ways.</hi> Jer. 16.17. <hi>Mine eyes are upon all thy ways.</hi> Heb. 4.13. <hi>Neither is there any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but is manifeſt in his ſight: but all things are naked and open to that God with whom we have to do.</hi> 1 John 3.20. <hi>God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things.</hi> Now all things conſidered from eternity, were either <hi>ſuch things which it was poſſible might be, but never were,</hi> nor <hi>are,</hi> nor <hi>ſhall be.</hi> God knew theſe things: <hi>He calleth the things that are not, as if they were,</hi> Rom. 4.17. he <hi>ſaw them in ſuo potenti,</hi> as he was able to have produced them. This Divines call <hi>ſcientiam ſimplicis intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiae.</hi> Or ſecondly, <hi>They are ſuch things as have been, now are,</hi> or <hi>ſhall be.</hi> Theſe things alſo God knew from eternity: <hi>Divines</hi> ſay, God knoweth theſe, <hi>In ſuo volenti per ſcientiam viſionis.</hi> He from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:192227:18"/>eternity ſaw them in a <hi>certain futurity,</hi> as <hi>things which ſhould certainly be:</hi> for God doth not know things as we do <hi>by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> one thing to day, another thing to morrow; for then there muſt have been a time when God was ignorant of ſome things, which were blaſphemy to aſſert: but ſuch is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nature of God, that he muſt by the ſame Act, and at the ſame time have a perfect knowledg of all things, that ever were to come to paſs in the created world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſing now that God from all eternity had ſuch a perfect knowledg of things, it followeth of neceſſity, <hi>That they were certainly to be, and have a certain exiſtence:</hi> for God could not know, and ſee thoſe things in a future exiſtence, of whoſe future exiſtence there was no certainty; which by the way is a concludent argument againſt the new device of <hi>Molina, Fonſeca, Suarez, Leſſius,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> ſince embraced by <hi>Vorſtius, Arminius, Grevinchovius,</hi> and their followers, who have deviſed a middle kind of <hi>conditional knowledg</hi> in God. Thus they ſay, that God knew <hi>that</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>James</hi> were in ſuch circumſtances they would believe. But this is to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for if there were no certainty of <hi>Peter's</hi> believing from eternity, God could not certainly know, what was not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now I would gladly be inſtructed by any who ſtumbleth at this <hi>Counſel and purpoſe of God, what but the will of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the event, could give a certainty of being, or exiſtence to any event?</hi> If the things that are, might not have been, then (as I ſaid before) God from eternity could not have had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledg of them as things to be: if there were a neceſſity of their being, what could make it but the will and purpoſe of God? For example: God did from all eternity <hi>certainly know,</hi> that his <hi>bleſſed Son</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> and Saviour, ſhould be born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> in the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and here live ſome years, and then be crucified; he did certainly know, that <hi>Herod</hi> ſhould <hi>mock him, Pilate judg</hi> and <hi>condemn him,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> crucifie him. Then I ſay from all eternity, theſe things were certainly to be, otherwiſe God could not have known them: God indeed did not decree to put that malice into the heart of <hi>Pilate, Herod,</hi> or the <hi>Jews.</hi> But he did decree that ſuch perſons ſhould be, and to ſuffer them to execute that malice of their hearts, yea and to influence them to thoſe actions,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192227:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſo far as they were natural actions: without that influence, neither <hi>Herod</hi> could have opened his mouth to <hi>mock him,</hi> nor <hi>Pilate</hi> to condemn him; nor could the <hi>Jews</hi> have lifted up their hands, to have either made a croſs, or driven a nail. That indeed they uſed this their natural ſtrength, and power, their tongues and hands thus wickedly, and maliciouſly, this was from the Devil, and from their own luſts; but God willed that it ſhould be done, though he did not will to do it in a way of efficiency. This was that which gravelled <hi>Vorſtius</hi> (a man of a clear head, and great Learning and Reaſon, though corrupt, having not learned to ſubmit his Reaſon to the Word of God), ſo that he confeſſeth it a very great difficulty to fix <hi>an immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſe of the certain exiſtence of future contingencies:</hi> he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons up all that is ſaid, and at laſt reckons this for one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>The determination of the Divine will,</hi> in which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held all things as certainly decreed, which were to be effected, as in the firſt efficient cauſe effectually decreeing them. He ſaith, <hi>That as this is the moſt received,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vorſtius de Deo, &amp; Attr. Not. ad Diſp.</hi> 5. p. 260. <hi>V. etiam,</hi> 267, 268.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo it is the trueſt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it be not extended to all future things, even to ſins,</hi> &amp;c. And again he tells us, <hi>That whatſoever we fix as the cauſe either of Gods fore-knowledg, or the future exiſtence of things, we ſhall everywhere find</hi> Labyrinthum inexplicabilem, <hi>an inexplicable Labyrinth.</hi> And indeed it is not to be determined, <hi>How God ſhould know all things from all eternity, if he had not willed them to be,</hi> either by his <hi>efficiency</hi> or <hi>permiſſion.</hi> And our adverſaries you ſee in this point, agree it the beſt way to fix it there; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are afraid, <hi>If God willed ſin to be,</hi> he muſt needs <hi>be the author of it:</hi> That we deny, we ſay he did not will the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any ſinful habit, nor the doing of any ſinful act, only that it ſhould be done; and you heard before, the Scripture ſpeaketh plainly enough in this caſe, That the Counſel of God had determined that ſhould be done, which was done againſt Chriſt by <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. My ſecond proof ſhall be from the <hi>actual Providence of God,</hi> extending to all <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi> The Scripture is full of expreſſions, proving this, <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work, John</hi> 5.17. My Text ſaith, <hi>He worketh all things.</hi> The actual Providence of God is a certain Servant to the Eternal Will, Purpoſe, and Counſel of God. It doth but execute the eternal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192227:19"/>thoughts and decrees. Look as every rational agent firſt think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, deliberateth, and determineth with himſelf what to do, and then his hands are employed to execute his purpoſes and deliberations: ſo God being the higheſt rational <hi>Agent,</hi> doth nothing in time, which did not meet with an eternal thought, nothing but what he had from eternity reſolved, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhould be done. Firſt, the Counſel of his Will paſſed upon the thing that it ſhould be, then his Providence bringeth it about, though in a different manner ſuited to the purity and holineſs of God: for <hi>God cannot be the author of ſin.</hi> The Providence of God therefore, as to actions that are evil, only <hi>permits</hi> the filth and obliquity of them, though it further concurreth to the motion, or action, as it is natural (for ſo it hath a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it). As the Writing-maſter guideth the childs-hand in the Writing of its Letters, but guideth it not to make blots, or any crooked or irregular ſtrokes; though it is true of him alſo, that if he pleaſed, he could hold the childs hand ſo ſteady, and ſo far influence it, that it ſhould not make an irregular ſtroke. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſpit upon our Saviours face, they nailed him to the Croſs; if God by his Providence had not aſſiſted their natural faculties to theſe actions, ſo far as they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, meerly natural, they could not have ſpoke or ſpit, nor moved an hand to lift up a crown of Thorns to his head, nor to have driven a nail into his fleſh. God did concur to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their natural ſtrength to their natural action: but now, That they ſpake bad words, rather than good, to, and of our bleſſed Lord; that they uſed their natural power to ſpit, (to the uſe of which God by his Providence concurred, rather to ſpit) upon Chriſts face than upon the ground, and their ſtrength rather to drive a nail into Chriſts fleſh than into the bare wood, and to work in their honeſt and lawful occupation; <hi>this was from the luſt of their own hearts.</hi> Their ſin was not in <hi>ſpitting</hi> or <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> or <hi>driving a nail,</hi> but in ſpitting on Chriſts face, in ſpeaking evil, and blaſphemouſly of Chriſt, in piercing his fleſh with their nails: This God had nothing further to do with, <hi>than to permit;</hi> for the juſt puniſhment of their former ſin, and for the further working out of his own Glory in the ſalvation of thoſe for whom Chriſt dyed. In the mean time the <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God had its place</hi> about their ſinful actions, though not <hi>cauſing,</hi> or any way <hi>effecting</hi> them, yet <hi>permitting,</hi> and not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192227:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>hindering the doing of them, in aſſiſting to the actions ſo far as they were natural. And this motion of Divine Providence, (which is but a ſervant to the Divine Counſel), doth certainly conclude ſuch a Divine Counſel, according to the nature of the operation of Providence. And this is enough to eſtabliſh the Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>This Propoſition in the firſt place ſheweth us the <hi>Vanity</hi> of thoſe who dream of an <hi>incertainty</hi> in the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:</hi> with <hi>reference to us</hi> there is a great <hi>incertainty,</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> we <hi>know not what a day will bring forth;</hi> but in it ſelf there is none, there is nothing but hath met with an <hi>eternal thought.</hi> The truth is, a <hi>certainty of Divine knowledg</hi> doth neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a <hi>certainty of events;</hi> for God could not have a certain knowledg from eternity of ſuch things, as in themſelves were <hi>incertain,</hi> whether they <hi>ſhould be or no. Vorſtius</hi> grants that God is <hi>omniſcient;</hi> but he expounds it thus, that he doth, <hi>Omnia ſcibilia exactiſſime ſcire quo quidem modo ipſa ſcibilia ſunt;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vorſtius de Deo, in Not. ad Diſp.</hi> 5. p. 268.</note> That God knows all that could be known, in that manner that they were to be known: ſo then it ſeems there were ſome things that could <hi>not be known</hi> by him who <hi>calleth the things that are not as if they were.</hi> I wonder what theſe things ſhould be? he will tell you, Thoſe things which depend <hi>upon the liberty of mans will.</hi> So then here is another <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> and <hi>mover ſet up,</hi> and God knows nothing of the effects and motions of that, till they diſcover themſelves in action. And I beſeech you, conſider how great a part of the <hi>Divine Knowledg</hi> this takes away. God according to this Doctrine could not from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity certainly know any thing that <hi>depended upon the will of man,</hi> ſo that it leaveth God <hi>no certain knowledg,</hi> but of things in their own nature <hi>neceſſary,</hi> which is a ſtrange notion of God, yet neceſſary to be held by all thoſe who are the Advocates of <hi>free-will,</hi> otherwiſe than as <hi>freedom</hi> is oppoſed to force and <hi>coaction:</hi> for if man hath a power to <hi>believe,</hi> or not to <hi>believe,</hi> God could not from <hi>eternity</hi> certainly know that man ſhould <hi>believe,</hi> becauſe he might not believe. I cannot underſtand how this aſſertion of the <hi>neceſſity of events,</hi> in regard of the Counſel of God concernig them, ſhould (as they ſay) take away the <hi>Providence of God:</hi> for what do they mean by Providence, but Gods continual <hi>inſpection of created Beings;</hi> his continual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon them to <hi>preſerve</hi> and <hi>uphold</hi> their beings and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:192227:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>and to <hi>govern</hi> their actions. Now ſuppoſing that God hath determined all Events, why he ſhould not yet inſpect all Agents, and uphold their powers and faculties to thoſe actions, which he hath willed to permit or effect, in order to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſuch effects and ends, and to govern all their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and actions in order to that end, I cannot tell. Do they contend for a <hi>liberty</hi> for God to alter the <hi>ſeries</hi> and <hi>courſe</hi> in which <hi>his will</hi> hath ſet all things? This indeed were reaſonable for fooliſh man, whoſe ſecond <hi>thoughts uſe to be beſt;</hi> and whom ſucceſſion of time teacheth knowledg; but not for God, whoſe will never moved, but circumſtanced with that infinite wiſdom, that required not a ſecond thought, and whoſe name is <hi>I am,</hi> and his will as immutable as his eſſence. But I haſten to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from this Doctrine, which ſhall be more practical.</p>
                  <p>This notion of the <hi>certainty of events</hi> from an eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> may be of great uſe <hi>for the quiet, ſtay, comfort and ſatisfaction of religious ſouls, under the ingrateful contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this life; whether cauſed from the immediate hand of God, or from the malice and wickedneſs of men.</hi> There is nothing which cometh ſo to paſs, but there firſt paſſed upon it the Counſel of the Divine Will: Then, a working of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, either effecting, or permitting it, immediately influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Agent, if it be good; permitting the oblique motions of mans will to it, and in it, his luſts and paſſions in their boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous motions, if the thing be evil. We are creatures who are full of paſſions, exceedingly ſubject to the exorbitancies, and over-boylings of them. In reference to <hi>evil,</hi> that is, things that are not pleaſing to our external ſenſes, there are two or three paſſions, which give us moſt, or all of the trouble of our lives. <hi>Fear,</hi> that torments us upon the proſpect of ſome great evil probable, or likely to fall upon us. <hi>Grief,</hi> that drowneth us upon the <hi>over-flowing</hi> of ſome <hi>Divine ſcourge</hi> upon our <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, families,</hi> or <hi>intereſts in the world. Anger,</hi> that <hi>corrodes,</hi> and conſumes us, becauſe we cannot be <hi>revenged</hi> upon ſuch as have been the <hi>inſtruments</hi> of any evil to us.</p>
                  <p>In the operations of all theſe, our corrupt nature is very prone to exorbitancy. Now under all accidents, apt to elicite, irritate, or inflame theſe paſſions, and ſo to diſorder, and to ſpoil the quiet and compoſure of our minds, it ſhould mightily ſtay
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:192227:20"/>us, that nothing is <hi>caſual or contingent to God;</hi> nothing cometh to paſs in time, but what he hath from all eternity determined, and ſet in order: man hath done, can do no more, than what God hath purpoſed, nor ſuffer more than what he hath fixed by the eternal <hi>counſel of his will.</hi> There are two neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of this <hi>eternal Predeſtination,</hi> and <hi>Predeſtination of God,</hi> which if duly weighed, will wonderfully relieve, and ſtay the hearts of Gods People under the troubleſom accidents and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies of this life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That although the Will and Counſel of God putteth no force upon rational agents,</hi> nor offers any <hi>violence to humane will, yet it layeth a neceſſity upon the event.</hi> This is what a Generation in the world will not underſtand, but nothing can be plainer to any who have ears to hear, or a mind to underſtand. Gods Counſel (as you heard) predetermined the death of Jeſus Chriſt: the Scripture plainly ſaith, That <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> did no more than what <hi>the Counſel of God had determined to be done,</hi> Act. 4.28. I would fain know now, whether (as to the event) it had been poſſible that <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> ſhould not have condemned, or the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould not have crucified Chriſt; <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will at any time?</hi> Yet certainly none will ſay, but as to the <hi>action Judas</hi> was not forced to betray him, nor <hi>Pilate</hi> to condemn him; they acted freely as to their action, although the event was neceſſary. Gods Counſel <hi>influenced the event,</hi> but not their wills to move them to the <hi>action.</hi> But I ſay, the <hi>neceſſity of the event,</hi> though it doth not juſtifie the <hi>Agent,</hi> nor authorize the Act; yet it is of wonderful uſe to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie ſuch, as ſuffer under ſuch events; and that upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As it letteth us know, <hi>That all our trouble and ſollicitude, all our fears, griefs, all our ſuſpicions, jealouſies, and condemnings of our ſelves, for any omiſſions, or neglects of means are in vain, and to no purpoſe.</hi> The thing muſt, or will be, it muſt, or would have been; God had determined it, there was an eternal Counſel had paſſed upon it. We are very prone upon ſad events, to torture our ſelves with ſuch reflexions as theſe; If this or that thing had not been done, if this or that means had not been uſed, this thing had not been, ſuch a friend had not dyed, ſuch a miſchief had not befallen me. <hi>Lord!</hi> (ſaith <hi>Martha,</hi> John 11.21.) <hi>if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not dyed.</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:192227:21"/>We are wonderfully miſtaken in theſe things: It is true, that our knowledg that <hi>events are certain,</hi> is no juſtification of us in the neglect of the uſe of any means in order to the obtaining any good we deſire, or preventing or removing of any evil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, or imminent over us: and the reaſon is plain, 1. <hi>Becauſe though the event be certain, yet we are not aſſured of it:</hi> and as to duty, the caſe is the ſame of things which are not, and which appear not to us. 2. <hi>Becauſe that God, who hath willed us any good, or the preventing or removing of any evil,</hi> hath willed both the one, and the other to be obtained, in the uſe of ſuch means, as either in a natural way of working, or upon the evidence of reaſon, or direction of Scripture, appear proper for the obtaining it. And 3. <hi>It is the Command of God we ſhould uſe means.</hi> But ſuppoſing no means neglected, the <hi>Predetermination of God ought to ſatisfie us,</hi> though we miſs of ſome good, which we paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired, or ſuffer under the preſſure of ſome evil, which we paſſionately deſired a deliverance from, and uſed all means in our power to be freed of: it ſhould alſo quiet us as to any fears that are immoderate, and diſtracting our minds concerning any evil likely to befal us, or any who relate to us, when we have it in proſpect, and ſee it hanging over our heads. It may alſo be of great uſe to ſtill our ſpirits concerning means, leſs ſucceſsfully, and ineffectually uſed to prevent ſuch evils; yet, as I ſaid before, and for the reaſons I before mentioned, we muſt take heed of thinking that this <hi>certainty of the event,</hi> from the <hi>Divine Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and Will, giveth us any thing of a <hi>ſuperſedeas,</hi> as to the uſe of any proper means, which we are equally obliged to uſe, as if the event had been incertain and caſual, and might as well not have been, as been.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But there is more yet in this notion, to ſatisfie every good Chriſtian; for if <hi>all events</hi> (how ingrateful ſoever to us) are according to the <hi>eternal purpoſe of God,</hi> and the <hi>Counſel of the Divine Will,</hi> 1. They neceſſarily muſt be <hi>good.</hi> 2. <hi>The products of infinite wiſdom.</hi> 3. And of <hi>infinite love,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> to ſuch, as <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay they <hi>neceſſarily muſt be good.</hi> I mean this of ſuch as God hath willed to <hi>effect,</hi> not ſuch events as God hath only willed to permit. But of the firſt ſort are all <hi>evils of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> It is not beneath God to be the Author of his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Evils of affliction are only nominally, and nuncupative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p n="2">2. They muſt needs be the <hi>products of infinite wiſdom.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>works of God,</hi> ſaith, <hi>In wiſdom hath he made them all.</hi> It is true of Gods Counſels, in <hi>infinite wiſdom</hi> God hath eſtabliſhed them all; ſo as all events are fixed in the beſt order imaginable, for the <hi>glorifying of God,</hi> which is the higheſt end any action can be levelled and directed to. It is the higheſt end which God could act for; becauſe he could work for no higher, he hath wrought, and ſtill worketh for himſelf: it is the higheſt end that we can act for, and that to which as we ought to direct all our actions, ſo we alſo ought to ſubmit all our paſſions. The ſum of all our Prayers is, or ſhould be, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified:</hi> If God be glorified, every good man hath his higheſt wiſh, his utmoſt deſign, and deſire. Now if all events were from eternity ſet in order, and predetermined by a <hi>Counſel of the Divine Will;</hi> they muſt be ordered to the Glory of God, becauſe they are ordered by and in infinite wiſdom, which always directeth the beſt means, in order to the beſt end. God could not be deceived in his contrivement, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning of means, in order to his own ends. Although therefore we may, and ought to mourn, and be afflicted, for many things which we ſee done under the Sun; becauſe they are brought to paſs by the <hi>luſts, malice,</hi> and <hi>wickedneſs of men;</hi> by their ſinful corruptions and paſſions, by which God is highly diſhonoured, and it may be we cannot underſtand what honour God can have from the event it ſelf; yet we ought at laſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect our ſelves, and get victory over our paſſions, and to ſay, <hi>Was not the hand of God in this thing?</hi> Was this a ſlip of the eternal Counſel, or was it a product of it? Surely nothing ſlipt the <hi>Divine notice;</hi> whatever happens, was ordered by him, who was infinitely <hi>wiſe in Counſel,</hi> who could order nothing but in <hi>infinite wiſdom,</hi> and in ſubſerviency to the great end of his actions, the <hi>Glory of his Name.</hi> Every good Chriſtian there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought at laſt to ſatisfie himſelf as to what he ſeeth before him in the world, and to ſay, Let come what will of me, and mine, or of a thouſand others little concerns, I am fruſtrated of my expectations and deſires; I thought God might have been more glorified my way, I ſee I was miſtaken. God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fruſtrated of his ends, nor be deceived as to means proper
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:192227:22"/>for the compaſſing of them. This thing came not to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the eternal Counſel of the Divine Will. God is true to his own end; he would never have decreed to have permitted it, nor have permitted it actually, if he had not known how to have compaſſed his Glory by, and from it, when done: <hi>Surely, the wrath of man ſhall praiſe him.</hi> I cannot ſee the Wiſdom of God in it, but there is an infinite wiſdom in it; and when the Lords work is finiſhed, I ſhall then ſee it, and be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what I now do not. I cannot look to ſee the bottom of Divine Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But this is not all: ſuppoſing this, <hi>All events and accidents muſt to thoſe who love and fear God, be not only the products of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom, with reſpect to Gods glory, which is the higheſt end, but with reſpect alſo to their good;</hi> and this not only in regard of the <hi>Promiſe, That all things ſhall work together for the good of them that love God;</hi> but alſo of his fatherly <hi>relation unto them, All things are theirs, becauſe they are Chriſts,</hi> and Chriſt is Gods. God hath ſaid concerning them, that <hi>with an everlaſting love he hath loved them;</hi> and having done ſo, all his <hi>eternal counſels,</hi> all the motions of his Providence, muſt be ordered to the Demonſtration of it; and this every Child of God ſhall firſt or laſt ſee. It fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out with us, as with an <hi>ignorant perſon,</hi> which goeth into a Limners Shop; he ſeeth there a rude and imperfect draught of a picture, and thinketh that it looks ugly; but he ſeeth not the <hi>Idea</hi> of the intended draught in the Limners fancy, and hath not patience to wait, until he hath finiſhed his work, which if he had, he would then ſee it a very beautiful piece. Thus many of us looking upon Gods Works before they be finiſhed, we paſs an ill judgment upon them. But could we but ſee the <hi>Platform</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> of them in the <hi>eternal Counſel</hi> of the Divine Will, or ſtay with patience till the Providence of God had finiſhed his work, we ſhould then apprehend it beautiful, and very agreeable to the Glory, Wiſdom, Mercy, Truth, and Goodneſs of that God, which it is produced to demonſtrate to the world; and that we cannot ſee this before, is our weakneſs and imperfection. The malice of men in the perſecutions of Gods People, looketh upon us with an horrid aſpect: theſe indeed God doth not effect, but he hath willed they ſhould be, and hath told us, they muſt come, yea, and he worketh too permitting others to bring them about, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them in the execution of their malice, whom he could eaſily
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:192227:22"/>hinder: but when theſe things are over, we often ſee both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom and goodneſs too in them. How ſhould the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Sinners have been purchaſed, if God had not permitted <hi>Judas</hi> to have betrayed his Maſter, <hi>Pilate to have condemned him,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> to have nailed him to the Croſs? had it not been for the perſecution of the <hi>Jews,</hi> how ſhould the Goſpel have gone to the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> But yet for a cloſe of this diſcourſe, and that we may not miſtake our Duty, we ought not to be ſo far ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied upon the Contemplation of this great truth; but that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt be piouſly affected with the ſad Providences which God meaſureth out to his Church and People.</hi> What ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, If I forget thee, O Hieruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.</hi> The ſad rebukes of Gods Providence ought by us to be laid to heart. Though perſecutions and other puniſhments be contrivances of infinite wiſdom, and products of certain and infinite love; yet to the preſent ſufferers, they may be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſin, and marks of Divine diſpleaſure, and therefore ought not to paſs over our heads, without our taking ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, and the cauſing of ſome ſad thoughts within us: the crucifying of Chriſt was the product of infinite wiſdom and goodneſs to the People of God, but yet a juſt cauſe of ſadneſs to the Diſciples of Chriſt. We muſt take things as they appear to us, being not able to ſee to the end and bottom of Gods deſigns. That they ſhall at laſt iſſue in the Glory of God, and the good of his People, is indeed matter of faith, and will be matter of joy to us, when we ſee it; but in the mean time it is matter of ſadneſs to us, to ſee Gods Vineyard rooted up, his People eaten up like bread, and wicked men ſuffered to devour thoſe that are more righteous than themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, We have reaſon to be afflicted both for our own ſins, and the ſins of others. Although it be as to the event true, that both our own and others ſins ſhall iſſue in Gods Glory; yet it is as true, that God hath no need either of ours or any others lyes for his Glory, and that God is both by our ſins, and the ſins of others actually diſhonoured. That they are made to iſſue in Gods Glory, is the product of Gods Wiſdom, not our oblique and irregular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or intention, and therefore they ought to be cauſes of ſad reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to us. But thus far we may ſatisfie our ſelves, 1. <hi>That</hi> (as I ſaid before) <hi>the event was neceſſary,</hi> and nothing that hath come to paſs, could, with our utmoſt care and diligence, have been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:192227:23"/>than it is. We may talk after the manner of men, and reaſon after the meaſures of humane probabilities: <hi>If ſuch a thing had not been, another had not followed;</hi> but there is nothing iſſued in time, but was ordered from all eternity. 2. We ought again in this to be ſatisfied, <hi>That of whatſoever the Lord hath promiſed, nothing ſhall fail.</hi> We are full of <hi>unbelief,</hi> and when we ſee <hi>Gods Providence</hi> working (as we judg) directly contrary to what he hath promiſed, we are preſently giving up all for gone and loſt; but if every thing be wrought according to the Counſel of the Divine Will, and the Holy Scriptures be ſuch part of this will, as he hath pleaſed to reveal to us, God knoweth both what he hath ſaid, and how he hath laid things in his eternal thoughts, and ſooner ſhall Heaven and Earth paſs away, than any word he hath ſpoke:
<note place="margin">Prov. 19.21. Iſa. 40.8.</note> 
                     <hi>The counſel of the Lord ſhall ſtand: and the word of our God ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And laſtly, As I have before told you, we may be thus far ſatisfied, <hi>That whatſoever doth, or ever ſhall come to paſs in the world, ſhall ſerve Gods great ends;</hi> becauſe it is ordered by the Counſel of the infinitely wiſe God, and therefore muſt neceſſarily ſerve his deſigns. In the end of the world we ſhall ſay, God could not have had ſo much Glory, but for ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, ſuch a diſorder. <hi>Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe him.</hi>

                  <p>THE laſt time I ſhewed you, That God hath from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſetled all events by an eternal purpoſe, according to the Counſel of his Will; nothing cometh to paſs in time, but what was determined before time. I told you my deſign was to diſcourſe concerning Gods Acts of Providence, which are acts in time; and particularly to diſcourſe ſome things relating to actual Providence, which do not fall into ordinary diſcourſe, and often give occaſion of trouble to the ſpirits of Chriſtians: but in order to that, I thought it reaſonable, Firſt, to diſcourſe a little of Gods Settlement of all futurities (things which were to be fulfilled in their ſeaſon), by an act of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counſel. Nor can I yet come fairly at my intended ſubject, without ſpeaking to Gods firſt Act in time (that was <hi>Creation);</hi> concerning which we muſt ſuppoſe a Decree of God, according to that known Rule in Divinity, <hi>Decretum Dei, &amp; ejus execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio exquiſitiſſime conveniunt; nihil eſt in Dei opere, quod non fuit in decreto, &amp; nihil fuit in decreto quod non ſequitur in opere.</hi> That is, the Decree of God, and the execution of that Decree, moſt exquiſitely agree: God worketh nothing but what he firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, and he decreed nothing but hath had, or ſhall have its iſſue in his working: and when we ſay God doth any thing, we by it do underſtand no more than a new effect of his eternal Will. According therefore to the Counſel of his Will, God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:192227:24"/>firſt made of nothing, the world, and all that is therein. And indeed, according to ſome notion of Providence amongſt Divines, this is a part of it. Now for a foundation of a ſhort Diſcourſe upon this ſubject, I have choſen this Text.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſubjoyneth the words of my Text, to a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith, which he had given, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Where he had told us, <hi>That faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> In the ſecond verſe he had told us, <hi>That by this the Elders had obtained a good report.</hi> Here he ſaith, <hi>By faith we underſtand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c. In the Text you have,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A <hi>Divine aſſertion. The worlds were framed by God: things which are ſeen, were not made of things which do appear.</hi> You have the work of <hi>Creation</hi> deſcribed in its Cauſes: <hi>Negatively,</hi> the world did not make it ſelf, one part of it did not make another; then <hi>Poſitively,</hi> it was <hi>framed by God;</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. You have the way deſcribed, how we come to comprehend this in our underſtanding: <hi>By faith.</hi> The Propoſition of the Text is this:</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The word in the Greek ſignifies, <hi>to make, to joynt, or fit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to reſtore:</hi> it ſignifieth, <hi>to make,</hi> or rather to <hi>make up</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Idiom), <hi>to perfect.</hi> It is uſed <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.16. <hi>Thou haſt perfected praiſe:</hi> we tranſlate it <hi>perfect,</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,</hi> Luk. 6.40. <hi>And be you perfect,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.11. 1 Theſ. 3.10. That we might <hi>perfect that which is lacking in your faith,</hi> Heb. 10.5. <hi>A body haſt thou prepared</hi> [or made me]. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.21. The world was <hi>made,</hi> eſtabliſhed, made perfect by God: <hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The word ſignifieth to be <hi>made perfect,</hi> to joynt; to be put together. The world is a beautiful compoſition, it hath not only a Being, but a beautiful Being, all the parts of it being <hi>fitted and joynted together;</hi> this is alſo from <hi>God:</hi> it oweth not only its <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> unto God, but whatſoever it hath of <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Ornaments;</hi> that one part of it is fitted to another, the beautiful compoſition of it, the ſubordination of the parts of it one to another, all this is owing unto God. This is part
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:192227:25"/>of the ſenſe of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That you may be perfectly joyned together.</hi> Whoſo looketh upon the Creation wiſtly, muſt ſee it conſiſt of a great variety of things; but all fitted together, ſo as there is no diſcord, but a beautiful ſubordination of things in that vaſt compoſition: ſo as they ſerve one another, and notwithſtanding all their different affections and qualities; yet they deſtroy not, nor invade each other: this alſo is from the Lord. The world was not only by God made, and produced out of a <hi>not-being,</hi> into a <hi>being;</hi> but it was fitted, ordered, joynted together by God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The word ſignifieth alſo to <hi>reſtore,</hi> and <hi>bring again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to order,</hi> what is diſordered; and ſo it is uſed ſometimes to <hi>mend</hi> nets: <hi>Rem lacer am aliquam reſarcire &amp; collapſam reparare.</hi> And this ſeemeth to be the primary and moſt proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the word. Thus it is tranſlated, <hi>reſtore, Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>If a brother be fallen, reſtore ſuch a one.</hi> A <hi>Metaphor,</hi> ſay ſome, taken from <hi>Chyrurgions,</hi> putting a bone out of order in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its place again. The world at firſt made, perfected, eſtabliſhed, and joynted by God, in the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was diſordered, and put out of joynt: God by ſending his Son, put the world in joynt again; ſet its broken bones, created a <hi>new heaven, and a new earth.</hi> Thus alſo the <hi>worlds were made,</hi> as it were made again, and reſtored by God. But I take the two former ſenſes rather to agree to this place; where the Apoſtle rather ſpeaks of the firſt Creation of the world by God, than of the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it by Jeſus Chriſt. The world then was made, that is, it had its firſt Original, its Order, Ornaments, beautiful compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, from a Divine creating Power; it did not give a Being, nor a Beauty and Perfection to it ſelf. The Verb is <hi>paſſive,</hi> it had its Original from another, and this other was <hi>he</hi> whom we call God. But,</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What is the meaning of this, that the worlds were made by the Word of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>None can underſtand here by the Word of God, <hi>the Holy Scriptures,</hi> which are called the <hi>Word,</hi> that is, the <hi>revealed will</hi> of God, ſpoken by holy men, as they were inſpired by God. Nor do I think that the ſame is meant here by the Word of God, that is underſtood, <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the word:</hi> of that <hi>word</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>That it was with God</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:192227:25"/>
                     <hi>that it was God; all things were made by him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him was not any thing made that was made:</hi> that is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Chriſt. Of him our Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>By whom alſo he made the worlds:</hi> but beſides that, the Goſpel of <hi>John</hi> ſeemeth to be the only Scripture in which the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Trinity is ſtiled the <hi>Word;</hi> neither is he there call'd <hi>the Word of God;</hi> it is there ſaid, <hi>The word was God, and in the beginning with God,</hi> but he is no-where call'd the word of God. I chuſe therefore rather to interpret it of that word of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Command</hi> which <hi>Moſes Gen.</hi> 1. telleth us, God uſed in the making of the world, and the fitting and joynting of it together. He ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Worlds were made by the Word of God, ſo as the term is both <hi>excluſive</hi> of any other inſtrumental cauſe in the Creation of the world, and <hi>expreſſive</hi> of the true <hi>inſtrumentally</hi> efficient cauſe, which was the mighty, powerful, commanding virtue of the Word of God.

I do therefore take the Text to be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine aſſertion of the Creation of the World, againſt the vain imaginations of the Heathens; who either dream't that it was <hi>eternal,</hi> or made of a <hi>caſual concourſe of Atoms,</hi> or from ſome <hi>Idea's.</hi> It was, ſaith the Apoſtle, made of <hi>nothing by the Word of God,</hi> of <hi>nothing</hi> that doth appear. And ſo I have done with the firſt Member of the Propoſition, <hi>That the worlds were framed by the Word of God: the things which are ſeen, were not made of thoſe things which do appear.</hi> I proceed to the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Mem. 2. <hi>That we underſtand this by faith.</hi> Here I ſhall ſpeak to two things: 1. <hi>What is here meant by faith?</hi> 2. <hi>How do we by faith underſtand this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> in Scripture ſometimes ſignifieth <hi>the object of faith,</hi> the Word of God. Thus <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.23. <hi>He which perſecuted us in times paſt, now preacheth the faith which he once deſtroyed.</hi> Thus you read of the <hi>hearing of faith,</hi> Gal. 3.2. <hi>Received you the ſpirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith;</hi> that is, of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> particularly the Goſpel? ſometimes it ſignifieth the <hi>act of faith,</hi> which as it reſpecteth the <hi>Propoſition of the word</hi> for its object, is a <hi>firm and ſteady aſſent,</hi> the agreement of the mind to the truth of the Propoſition; as it <hi>reſpecteth the perſon of the Mediator,</hi> is a <hi>reſting, relying, and recumbency upon him,</hi> which is what we call the <hi>juſtifying act of faith:</hi> you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the term <hi>Faith</hi> in either ſenſe. By the <hi>word of faith</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:192227:26"/>revealing it, and by our ſouls acting faith, in agreeing and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the truth of that word; we underſtand that the world, <hi>heaven and earth,</hi> was at firſt brought into being, fitted and joynted together by the powerful Word of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the production of all thoſe Beings which are in the world, and that beauty and order in which we ſee them placed.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, <hi>How doth the Apoſtle ſay we underſtand it by faith?</hi> May not this be underſtood by Reaſon? if it may, what need Faith in the caſe? or why, or how doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>by faith</hi> we underſtand this? Wherein doth Faith give us a further knowledg of this, than Reaſon hath given the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher?</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer; Undoubtedly <hi>reaſon</hi> hath gone a great way, and may go a great way to make men underſtand, <hi>that the world was made by God.</hi> That the world was <hi>eternal,</hi> was indeed the opinion of a great Pagan Philoſopher; but his maſter <hi>Plato</hi> was of another mind, and he is ſaid to have learned it from <hi>Heſiod:</hi> and the moſt and wiſeſt amongſt the Heathens, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the world was at firſt by a <hi>Divine power</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of a <hi>not-being</hi> into a <hi>being.</hi> Nor indeed would their Reaſon allow them to judg otherwiſe; the infinite motions (the meaſures of things in the world), their order and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, their alterations and corruptions duly conſidered, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth reaſonable ſouls, with any conſiſtency to themſelves, to affirm the world to have had an eternal exiſtence. All motions muſt be in time, and have had a being; all ſucceſſions and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of things plainly ſpeak, that they had a beginning; if we had no aſſiſtance in the proof of it from the word of faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſame Reaſon will agree that it gave not a firſt being to it ſelf, <hi>nothing is the efficient cauſe of it ſelf:</hi> experience tells us, that it is not in the power of a man to make the leaſt hair of his head white or black, much leſs to make an hair. Man is the nobleſt ſublunary Creature, but cannot make the meaneſt vegetable; all that his art can do, is but to counterfeit and diſſemble nature; if it be but as to a ſpire of graſs, or to the meaneſt flower of the field.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>if it were not eternal:</hi> if it did not make it ſelf: if one part of it did not make another; it muſt be made by God.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:192227:27"/>The <hi>worlds comprehending</hi> Angels and Men, ſenſitive and vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive creatures; theſe all having had a beginning, and none of them being able to give being to another: we muſt in reaſon find out a more powerful and excellent firſt being, that muſt give being to all the beings in the world. This firſt being is that glorious infinite being, whom we call <hi>God.</hi> In ſhort, he that further conſidereth the world in its ſtructure and compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as one part is knit and united to another: he that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the <hi>multitude</hi> of the creatures, their <hi>magnitude;</hi> the great and excellent <hi>powers, vertues, and qualities</hi> of ſome of them; the <hi>Symmetry</hi> of the ſeveral parts of the world, their ſubordinations each to other; muſt needs in reaſon, and by the force of that conclude, <hi>That the worlds were made by God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the Apoſtle's words muſt not be underſtood <hi>excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> not as if we could no way but <hi>by faith</hi> underſtand this: It may be underſtood by Reaſon; and many that knew nothing of Faith, yet confeſſed it, and agreed it from the evidence of their Reaſon. Yet is not <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> to be confounded: Reaſon concludeth from connate, natural principles; Faith from acquired, revealed principles: neither evidence contradicteth each other. We underſtand it by <hi>reaſon</hi> more darkly, confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, imperfectly, faintly; <hi>by faith</hi> we underſtand it more <hi>clearly, diſtinctly,</hi> more <hi>perfectly,</hi> and <hi>fixedly.</hi> By Reaſon we underſtand a little thereof: by the Revelation of faith we underſtand it fully. Let me a little further open this to you in three or four particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Reaſon rather ſheweth us, <hi>that the world,</hi> then, <hi>that the worlds are made by Gods.</hi> It rather evidenceth to us the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſublunary things, which are ſubject to our ſenſes, whoſe natures and accidents we underſtand; than of thoſe things which are above the air. Reaſon will evidence to us, that the men of the world, the beaſts and plants are made by God; but we ſee the wits of the world diſputing whether there be any <hi>ſpirits</hi> or no: Reaſon layeth hold upon the alterations and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of ſenſible beings, that have quantity, and concludeth their Original from their corruptibility; but when we come to ſpeak of thoſe Beings, that have no quantity, but are meerly ſpiritual, and not ſubject to thoſe changes and corruptions, Reaſon is at a loſs in a great meaſure: here <hi>Faith</hi> (Revelation which is the object of Faith) muſt help us. That teacheth us,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192227:27"/>the <hi>worlds</hi> were made by God: the world of <hi>inviſibles,</hi> and things not ſubjected to ſenſe, as well as the world of <hi>ſenſibles.</hi> Reaſon will help us to conclude God <hi>the Father of all fleſh;</hi> but not that he is the <hi>Father of all ſpirits,</hi> while it prompteth us to diſpute whether there be any ſuch Beings as Spirits, yea or no. Reaſon would hardly have agreed ſuch Beings as Angels, if Revelation had not come in to make it a foundation to ſtand upon; but <hi>by faith</hi> we underſtand it. Suppoſing the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Word of God, it is clear enough there; and we cannot agree to the Scriptures, but we muſt agree to it; both that there are ſuch Beings as Spirits (ſubſtances without ſenſible matter), and that they were alſo made by God: being ſome of thoſe things in the Heavens, of which God was the Creator.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſing that Reaſon will tell us, <hi>That the worlds were made by God;</hi> yet it will not tell us, <hi>That they were made by the Word of God.</hi> Reaſon (as I have before hinted) will go a great way to perſwade, even an <hi>Ariſtotelian,</hi> that the World was not from <hi>eternity;</hi> but that it was made by a Divine omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Being, pre-exiſtent to it: inſomuch that ſome of <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> Diſciples in other things here deſerted him, and took themſelves ſo much concerned for their maſters Reputation, as to diſpute whether he ever meant it, yea or no. And the great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher himſelf, though he ſeemeth to have been fixed in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the worlds Eternity in many places: yet in ſome particular paſſages of his writings, particularly in his Book <hi>De Generatione,</hi> ſeems to have wavered, diſputing which way God went to work in making of the world. And the fancies of the great Philoſophers ran very wild in this point: ſome will have it, that he firſt made a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or heap of confuſed matter; and out of that heap all particular things: as the Glaſs-man or Potter maketh his Veſſels; or the Brick-maker maketh his Brick and Tile: as if it had not been as eaſie by one work for God to have made out of nothing, all particular things, as to have made a <hi>Chaos</hi> out of nothing, that ſhould in it potentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the ſpecies of particular Beings. Others would have that Heap or Maſs, call'd the <hi>Chaos,</hi> to have been eternal, out of which God produced all things: ſo it ſhould have been an improper Creation; not <hi>ex nihilo materiae,</hi> from a nothing of pre-exiſtent matter; but <hi>ex nihilo ſubjecti capacis,</hi> from a nothing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:192227:28"/>of a ſubject capable to receive ſuch forms. But that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all things out of a meer nothing, or not-being of matter; and by the <hi>word of his power</hi> gave a being, not only to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular forms of beings, but to all matter, and particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſaying, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light: let there be a firmament, and it was ſo.</hi> This is a thing Reaſon could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dream of, never from any connate principles conclude it. This faith tells us, the Word of God revealeth to us: Reaſon could never diſcern, never conclude: though it might conclude the thing, that the worlds were made by God; yet it could not conclude the <hi>modus,</hi> or manner of the thing, how God ſhould do it; or that he did it by the <hi>word of his power.</hi> This we could not by reaſon comprehend or underſtand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſon giveth us a confuſed general notion, that the worlds were made by God: but faith giveth us a diſtinct account of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, the order, manner, and method of them.</hi> Reaſon will tell us, the world could not be eternal, that it could not give an Original to it ſelf; that it muſt be produced by a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent being. But now for the circumſtances of the Creation, the order, the time, the manner, that the world was created in ſix days; that light was firſt created, then the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial bodies, and then the terreſtrial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What was done the firſt day, what the ſecond, what the third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Reaſon tells us not. Reaſon will tell us, that the firſt man was Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for he could not be eternal; he could not give being to himſelf, he muſt be produced by a more excellent being: but that the <hi>woman</hi> ſhould be made of the <hi>rib of man,</hi> That man ſhould be made <hi>according to the Image of God;</hi> That he was made the ſixth day, after the reſt of Gods Works, and had a Dominion given him over them: This <hi>Faith</hi> learns us, <hi>Reaſon</hi> telleth us nothing of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Reaſon creates in the ſoul, at beſt, but a <hi>faint aſſent</hi> to this <hi>Propoſition, That the worlds are made by God,</hi> and ſtill leaveth the mind under incertain fluctuations and doubts about it. <hi>By faith we underſtand,</hi> ſaith the Text; we are not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to underſtand thoſe things, of which we have only a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, confuſed, indiſtinct knowledg, and to which we only give an incertain languid aſſent. The great Philoſopher in the world (as you have heard) hath doubted, whether the world <hi>were made at all,</hi> or had an <hi>eternal exiſtence.</hi> Others, whether it had not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:192227:28"/>its Original from a caſual concourſe of Atoms: infinitely vain have been unſanctified mens imaginations, as in other things, ſo concerning the Original of the world; and <hi>optimus Philoſophus</hi> (we ſay) <hi>non naſcitur.</hi> We are diſputing ſtill the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed concluſions, which are no more than the ſtructures of Reaſon. So that indeed we are beholden to <hi>Faith,</hi> to the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the word</hi> (which is the object of Faith), and to the habits of <hi>Grace (habits of faith),</hi> for the ſettlement of our minds in Propoſitions of truth. It is but an auxiliary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as to Divine Propoſitions, which Reaſon gives us; our mind is not ſet at reſt, and ſettled by them. A luxuriant wit and fancy maketh all the perſwaſion and confirmation of them from Reaſon very incertain. Faith only brings the Soul to a reſt about them, and gives the ſoul a clear, diſtinct, certain notion, and underſtanding of them. By Reaſon we rather think, and opine, than underſtand, and certainly know, that the worlds were made by God. But this is enough for the Explication. I come to the Application of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>This in the firſt place may help to confirm our Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of it,</hi>

The produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of things out of a <hi>not-being</hi> into a <hi>being,</hi> required an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power: the producing of ſuch a variety of Beings, many of which were furniſhed, and adorned with ſuch excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and qualities; the kniting and joynting of all together, and putting them in ſuch an excellent ſubjection, and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation each to other, required an infinite wiſdom, a wiſdom pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to any created wiſdom; yea above all the wiſdom of the Creatures, had all their wiſdoms been united. This being infinite in Power, and Wiſdom, muſt be God: <hi>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,</hi> Gen. 1.1. <hi>God alone ſpread out the heavens,</hi> Job 9.8. <hi>He made the heavens, and the earth, the ſea, and all that therein is.</hi> Yea, thus the Lord proveth himſelf to be God, <hi>I am the Lord, and there is none other; forming the light, and making the darkneſs,</hi> verſ. 7. And thus the true and living God ſtandeth diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Idols,</hi> Jer. 10.11. <hi>The Gods that have not made the heavens and the

But <hi>Faith</hi> yet more confirmeth it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us?</hi> Indeed (as I before ſaid,) the ſtructure and fabrick of it ſheweth that one will willed it, one wiſdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and directed it, and that one hand framed it.

                     <hi>We may from hence learn, the uſefulneſs, neceſſity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of faith:</hi> Faith taken for the object of it, <hi>Faith</hi> taken for the habit and act of it. The Word of God, the habit of Faith, the exerciſe of it, they are all uſeful. We have great magnifyings of Reaſon, and indeed Reaſon is a noble faculty: it is that to the ſoul, which the eye is to the body, which light is to the eye; but Faith is not uſeleſs, becauſe Reaſon is uſeful; yea Reaſon muſt ride but in the ſecond Chariot: Reaſon would have taught us little of Spirits, indeed we <hi>by Faith</hi> know little of them; but we know ſo much as God will pleaſe to reveal; we had known much leſs, if left only to what concluſions we could have raiſed from natural principles. Reaſon would have taught us nothing in particular, how, and in what order, or in what time the world was made. Nay, 2ly, There is not an uſe of Faith only, but a <hi>neceſſity of it.</hi> The Creation of the world is an object of our Faith, and to be received upon the credit of the Word of God; we muſt ſo aſſent to it, as by our aſſent to give an homage to Gods Authority in revealing it: this we cannot do but by Faith. Finally, from this diſcourſe appeareth the <hi>Excellency of Faith;</hi> it maketh us to <hi>underſtand,</hi> that the worlds were framed by the Word of God; it puts our mind beyond doubts, and endleſs diſputes, and incertain fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; it leaveth us not to the endleſs inquiries of Philoſophy, how theſe things could be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

How every inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and brute creature praiſeth God: <hi>The heavens</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy-work: Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night declareth knowledg: there is no ſpeech nor language, where their voice is not heard: their line is gone out to the end of the earth, and their words to the end of the world: In them hath he ſet a tabernacle for the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 19.1, 2, 3, 4. There is no
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:192227:30"/>Creature but giveth a mute praiſe to God, they ſhew the Lords Glory, and praiſe him; as the picture finely drawn doth praiſe the Limner, or the building praiſeth the Maſon or Carpenter; as any great effect praiſeth its efficient cauſe. And this is a thing we ought to attend, and obſerve in our Contemplation and uſe of the Creatures; we ſhould view God in them: ſee how God is glorified in their brave and uſeful ſtructure and compoſition; Oh how ſweet a Contemplation would this be, if we could view the Glory, Power, Wiſdom, infinite Goodneſs of the Creator in them all! But ſecondly, How particularly is man concerned, to praiſe, love, and ſerve God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth! to man he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone given Reaſon to make concluſions; to man hath he given the word of Faith; for man he hath made all theſe things, and given him a Dominion over the work of his hands. Now <hi>who planteth a vineyard</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle), 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. <hi>and eateth not of the fruit thereof?</hi> The world is a great Vineyard, God hath planted it, he hath let it out to the Sons of men as his husband-men; <hi>Should he not eat of the fruit thereof?</hi> The inanimate Creatures, they <hi>declare the glory of God:</hi> the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens declare his Glory, the Earth ſheweth his handy-work, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, carry the high Praiſes and Glory of God to the utmoſt ends of the Earth. Do not you that are Fathers think your Sons obliged to ſerve, and to honour you? Yet you were but partial cauſes of their being; God did much more than you to their production. Doth not the Maſter think his ſervant is obliged to ſerve, and to honour him, becauſe he hath made him, he hath raiſed him up to ſome capacity of living in the world, to ſome dignity? The Potter thinketh that he may command the Pots which he hath made, and ſhall not man be the ſervant of the moſt high God, who made him, and who made the world for him?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Reaſon he ought to be ſo, he oweth his being, his well-being, all that he hath, all the accommodations of his life unto God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God expecteth it from him. <hi>Nulla neceſſitate coactus,</hi> (ſaith Holy <hi>Auguſtine) nulla ſua cujuſdam utilitatis indigentia permotus, ſed ſola bonitate ac liberrima voluntate fecit Deus quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid fecit.</hi> God was not compelled to make the world, he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:192227:31"/>needed it not, he made it meerly of his own goodneſs, and for the uſe of man. Can any one think that God doth not expect homage and ſervice from man? And from hence three things muſt follow,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the preſumptuous ſinner muſt neceſſarily be <hi>the moſt unnatural creature;</hi> he ſerveth not the end of his Creation. The graſs was made for the food of the beaſt, that ſerveth its end, it grows, is cut down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The beaſts ſerve their end, they were made for the uſe of man, for his food, his covering; they dye daily, are clipped, ſhorn, flea'd, and all for man, only the ſinner ſerveth not his end. He was made for the Honour and Glory of God, he doth nothing leſs; yea his whole life is a diſhonouring God, an abuſing of his holy name and things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this ſinner is the moſt <hi>ingrateful creature in the world:</hi> he acts from his will and choice, with the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Now doing ſo, conſidering that not only he is born in the Lords houſe, and is his Creation; but all the Creatures upon which he lives, by the uſe of which his life is made ſweet to him, are the Lords, his <hi>Wheat,</hi> his <hi>Oyl,</hi> his <hi>Wool, Silk, Flax,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>I Am now come to the Theme which I at firſt intended, <hi>viz.</hi> a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning <hi>Divine Providence;</hi> to which my two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were, indeed, but preliminary and introductory diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. I ſhall not ſpeak to <hi>Divine Providence</hi> in that latitude in which ſometimes Divines take it, as it comprehendeth the <hi>Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God;</hi> but ſhall reſtrain my diſcourſe to what Divines call <hi>Actual Providence:</hi> by which I underſtand <hi>the workings of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the world as created.</hi> We have already ſhewed, 1. That there <hi>was an eternal purpoſe of God, according to the counſel of his will, concerning all things.</hi> 2. That in purſuit of this, he firſt <hi>made the worlds, all creatures both in heaven and earth.</hi> Now the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Whether God, when he had made the <hi>worlds,</hi> left them to their own order and government, either ſubjecting them to a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical fate,</hi> or leaving them to their own inclinations, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>caring for them:</hi> or Whether he doth not exerciſe a daily care concerning them, in the preſervation of their beings, qualities, and faculties; and directing and governing their motions and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: we affirm the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> That as all things were made at firſt, <hi>per eſſentiam creatricem,</hi> by the creating power of the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, producing them out of a Not-being into a Being; ſo they are kept in Being and Order, <hi>per ejuſdem potentiam conſervatricem,</hi> by the ſame power, <hi>preſerving, upholding</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> of them. This is a very large <hi>Theme,</hi> ſhould I undertake it in the full extent and compaſs of it; but I ſhall reduce whatſoever I ſhall ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it to theſe Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſpeak ſomething concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Principal
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:192227:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>acts</hi> of Providence, as more generally reſpecting creatures. I ſhall therefore firſt prove the thing, That there is ſuch an act of God; and then diſcourſe of the two main acts of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In regard the <hi>motions of Providence</hi> are not all equal, I ſhall diſcourſe ſomething <hi>concerning the ſpecialties of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I ſhall ſhortly diſcourſe of the <hi>depths,</hi> and <hi>unſearchable things</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Something I ſhall alſo ſpeak (more largely) of <hi>our duty to obſerve it:</hi> and ſome more ſpecial obſervable things in the motions of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, I ſhall ſpeak ſomething fully concerning the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or hard Chapters of it. For what St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16, ſaith concerning <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> the ſame may be applied to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Divine Providence. <hi>There are in them ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they who are unlearned, and unſtable, wreſt, as they do other things, to their own deſtruction.</hi> The profane and carnal hearts of men wreſt them to their ruin: the jealous and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious Chriſtian to his own diſquiet. My work will then be, to anſwer ſome hard queſtions, ſolve ſome <hi>Phaenomena's,</hi> expound ſome hard Chapters; ſo as to reconcile the motions of Providence to the <hi>eternal purpoſe,</hi> the <hi>faithful promiſes,</hi> and the <hi>unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loving-kindneſs of God to his church and people.</hi> This ſhall be the method of my diſcourſe. Firſt, Let me open the term, and then eſtabliſh the thing, <hi>That there is a providence.</hi> The word, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> is derived from the Latine; and indeed ſtrictly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Notation of the word, ſignifies no more than a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of a thing that is to come; in which notion <hi>Tully</hi> deſcribes it.</p>
                  <p>This it may be gave ſome Divines advantage to extend the Notion of it to the <hi>Divine Preſcience.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> But this Notation is too ſhort to expreſs the Notion of <hi>Providence</hi> as an act of God, and indeed the Notation of it, both in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> ſignifies more than this. In the firſt a <hi>curious ſubtil ſearch and care;</hi> in the ſecond more than a bare ſight; ſuch a one as <hi>is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with care and minding the thing ſeen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed we do not find the Noun <hi>Providence</hi> attributed to God in Scripture: we find <hi>Tertullus,</hi> the <hi>Roman Orator,</hi> telling the Governour, <hi>That by his Providence many worthy things had been done for the Jewiſh Nation,</hi> Act. 24.2. But I do not remember the term <hi>Providence</hi> of God, applied to God any-where. But we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:192227:32"/>are not diſputing for a <hi>word:</hi> the thing we find <hi>up and down. Can God provide fleſh for his people,</hi> Pſal. 78. v. 20. <hi>God having provided better things for us,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Heb. 11.20. Job 38.41, <hi>Who provideth for the Raven his food, when his young ones cry unto God.</hi> Our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. argueth from this act of God towards the Birds and the Lillies, to diſſwade his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from a too eager ſollicitude for the things of this life. There again is the thing plain enough, though not the word <hi>Providence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hinted to you before, that ſome Divines uſe the term ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a far larger notion than I am ſpeaking to it, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of ſomething of the <hi>Divine Decrees,</hi> relating to all but rational beings: hence their diſtinction betwixt the <hi>Decree of Predeſtination, and the Decree of Providence.</hi> The latter they make <hi>the purpoſe of God to create the world, and to preſerve and govern it being created;</hi> and thus they make Creation a branch of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, (it was indeed a working according to the Counſel of the Divine Will). But I meddle not with the <hi>Decree,</hi> but ſhall limit my diſcourſe to the work of <hi>Providence,</hi> which I told you was <hi>Actual Providence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, the term, <hi>Providence,</hi> in the Notion wherein I ſhall ſpeak to it, ſignifies, <hi>The daily influence of the Divine Being upon the whole Creation, preſerving and upholding the ſeveral Beings and faculties of all the creatures, permitting, directing and governing their ſeveral motions and actions to the great end of his own glory, and other ends of their creation ſubordinated to this end.</hi> So I underſtand by it the <hi>work of God,</hi> which (as our Lord ſaith) <hi>he hitherto worketh, and his ſon worketh,</hi> contradiſtinct to the work of <hi>creation.</hi> Creation was his work in the beginning of time: this his work in the proceſs of time, beginning when Creation ceaſed. That was the work of ſix days; this his work ever ſince: That gave the creature its Being; this upholdeth and continueth that Being: both the works of an Almighty power, of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> For the works of the Trinity, with reference to the creature, are not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: what is the work of the Father, is alſo the work of the Son, and the work of the Holy-Ghoſt. So that when we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert a Divine Providence, extenſive to the whole Creation, this is that which we mean.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That as the bleſſed Trinity did at firſt by an Almighty power,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:192227:33"/>bring the worlds, both Heaven and Earth, and all creatures therein, out of a Not-being, into a Being; ſo he doth ſtill, wiſely and powerfully influence the whole creation, preſerving their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſeveral faculties of all his creatures; and ſo far dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, permitteth, and governeth their actions, that they ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ends, for which he created, and ſo qualified them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the great end of his glory.</hi> For (ſaith <hi>Solomon) he made all things for himſelf;</hi> and <hi>for him,</hi> as well as <hi>of him,</hi> are <hi>all things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle). The <hi>School-men</hi> ſay, that Gods Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is <hi>eſſe fixum,</hi> a fixt and unalterable Being, in which there can be <hi>no variableneſs, no ſhadow of change:</hi> his name is, <hi>I AM,</hi> he is the ſame <hi>yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> But the creatures Being, is <hi>eſſe fluxum,</hi> a mutable Being; we ſee changes and varieties every day, in their Beings, in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the whole creation is but one <hi>great Sea,</hi> in a <hi>continual flux</hi> and <hi>reflux.</hi> Now, as God by his <hi>Decree of Providence</hi> from eternity, determined theſe ſucceſſions, varieties and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo like a great King, <hi>mighty in Counſel,</hi> and <hi>wonderful in working,</hi> he upholdeth them to them, and he governeth them in their effects. So that, as the former Doctrine of creation excluded the <hi>Pagan conceits,</hi> either of the worlds eternity, or caſual compoſition of it, and gave God the glory of that his firſt and great work of <hi>creation:</hi> ſo this is oppoſed to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical conceits of thoſe, who would have the created world, to be either a principle to it ſelf, of its ſtanding or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in the order it is; or as a great <hi>Machine</hi> or <hi>Engine</hi> moving from ſome great wheels that move all the reſt, (which is ſaid to be the Peripatetick Doctrine, and much ſuits our Judicial Aſtrologers), or moving from any other firſt principle than the <hi>will, command,</hi> or influence of God. This is a great point, giving God <hi>the glory of His,</hi> and <hi>his Sons</hi> hitherto <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We live in a generation when <hi>Atheiſm</hi> aboundeth, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it were needleſs to eſtabliſh ſo great a principle. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> thought he deſerved to be anſwered with a <hi>Gallows</hi> that denied it. Suffer me a little to confirm your faith in it, by arguing it, 1. <hi>From the Creation.</hi> 2. <hi>From the Nature of the Divine Being.</hi> 3. <hi>From the effects which are our daily objects of ſenſe in the World.</hi> 4. <hi>From the more ſure word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</hi>

                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:192227:33"/>1. That the <hi>worlds</hi> were firſt made by God, <hi>I before ſhewed you:</hi> Our eyes are continually exerciſed in the view of a vaſt Theater (and 'tis but a little of it that we behold). The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens (that are viſible to us) are repleniſhed with great and vaſt bodies, the Sun, Moon, and Stars; in the Heavens are great Clouds, containing vaſt quantities of water: The Earth is full of multitudes of ſpecies, infinite individuals of all ſorts; all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a variety of contrary faculties, and qualities; ſo are the wide Seas. The Earth hangs in the midſt of the air. Theſe things have laſted ſome thouſands of years. The inanimate creatures ſtill keep their Stations. The Sun is not wearied, nor worn out in its courſe, though it runs it with a ſtrange ſwiftneſs every day. The Moon is where, and as it was; the fixed Stars keep their abodes, and the wandring Stars, yet go not out of their road. The Earth drops not down under us, nor doth the Sea invade the Earth; not a ſpecies of creatures is loſt, from the firſt Creation. Individuals indeed periſh, but as <hi>one generation goeth, another comes:</hi> the ſpecies in competent numbers is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The creatures move and work in a ſubordination to the good each of others; the production and being of no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, antedates the being or production of another upon which it lives. Thoſe that renew their lives with the year, have their table ſpread before they appear. The ſilk-worms egg quickens not, but in proportion to the budding of the Mulberry. Each creature knows its ſeaſon, when to fly from colder Countreys, in which it could not endure the winter, into what is warmer. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have a care provided for them, while they are not able to provide for themſelves; which then, as naturally leaveth them, as it before wrought for them: The Bee and Ant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the winter: in ſhort, a thouſand ſuch inſtincts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations might be inſiſted on. Countreys that have moſt poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, have moſt antidotes; few Countreys have ſufficiency for themſelves, but muſt be beholden to their neighbours. Take any one body, but eſpecially that of <hi>Man</hi> (who is a little world in himſelf); ſtudy but your ſelves, and conſider how many Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, how many limbs and inſtruments muſt daily be kept clean and entire: How many humours, joynts, and members, muſt be kept in order to keep you alive, and in any degree of health and capacity to the operations of humane life. I would now fain know whence all this is: Will any aſcribe all this to a <hi>fate,</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:192227:34"/>or order at firſt ſet? Suppoſe any would ſay ſo, he muſt needs conceive an omnipotent Divine Being, at firſt ſetting the joynts of the world in ſuch an order; and ſurely it were as eaſie for him to ſuppoſe the ſame being upholding and preſerving them in order; yea, and in acknowledging the former, he muſt be forced to acknowledg the latter. We ſee a skilful workman making a Clock or Watch, conſiſting of many wheels, and little inſtruments, that ſhall have and keep their ſeveral motions 24, 48, hours; ſuppoſe it were two or three months, ſuppoſe it were ſo many years; yet we ſee at laſt it muſt not only be wound up, but by daily motion the wheels, and other parts (though made of hardeſt mettals) decay: How is it, that in ſo many thouſand years the Sun, Moon, and Stars are not worn, nor abated in their light? That by the daily motions of mans body, his inſtruments of motion are not ſooner worn out? (his bones are not of Braſs, nor his ſinews of Iron); if they were, leſs than ſeventy years would wear them out. Will any ſay things are not under a fate, but are left to move at their pleaſure? We know there are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of natural Agents, that move not upon election or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, but naturally and neceſſarily; how come theſe influenced? For thoſe that do move from Counſel, and have a <hi>Will</hi> to guide them: Let but any conſider what a confuſion would preſently be by the wayward actions of Children and Servants in his own houſe, if they had nothing but their own wills to guide and govern them: What an heap of confuſions every City or Town would make, if all inhabitants were left to their own wills and government; and he will eaſily conceive what a place of ataxy, miſchief and diſorder the world would be, if God did not daily work and rule in the midſt thereof. The infinite variety, with the different qualities of created Beings, yet all conſpiring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the good and order of the whole; the order we ſee amongſt them; their ſubſerviencies and ſubordinations each to other; they all ſpeak that there is a God, that by his Providence ruleth the world. Whoſo lifteth up his eyes to the Heavens, and conſidereth the conſtant unwearied motions of thoſe great celeſtial bodies, with the evenneſs of them; ſo as they are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to a ſcience of all other moſt certain, liable to little more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, than an extraordinary command to the Sun to ſtand ſtill in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and <hi>the Moon</hi> in the <hi>valley of Ajalon,</hi> or to go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſome few degrees, as in <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> time; or conſidereth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:192227:34"/>the vaſt bodies of water ſometime in the Heavens, coming upon us, not as water from a pail, but through a water-pot; muſt needs conclude a Superiour hand, directing and guiding the motions, and holding the thin Cloud that it is not rent; while the rain makes its orderly paſſage by drops through the thin and ſubtil parts of it. Whoſo ſtandeth by the Sea-ſide, and obſerveth that vaſt body of water, driven by fierce winds ſometimes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly by its natural motion invading the Earth, as if it would preſently ſwallow it up; and obſerveth it after the ceaſing of the wind, or a ſix hours progreſſive motion, gradually retreating, and leaving it out of fear, yea, and further leaving a water-mark for the following flow, unleſs at ſome certain times, before and after the full of the Moon, muſt needs acknowledg a Supreme Being, ſetting bounds unto it, which it hath no reaſon to preſcribe to it ſelf; nor is it ſubject to the Command of the greateſt Potentate on Earth. Finally, he that ſtandeth upon the Earth, and conſiders its annual productions; the variety of Creatures, of all orders in it, their Sympathies, and Antipathies; their Succeſſions, the varieties of their Beings, Motions, and Qualities; and yet their mutual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviencies to one another, and ſubjection to each other; muſt be no leſs than a moſt abſurd and bruitiſh Atheiſt, if he will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that no leſs than the daily and mighty influence of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God could compound their living together upon the ſame ſoil, in any harmonious agreement each with other. That every thing ſhould know its ſeaſons, and keep its bounds, and be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to man, weaker than many of them; and not tranſgreſs its order or end (but when armed by God as a part of his Hoſt to revenge his quarrels upon ſinners), muſt be from a knowledg which God gives them, and a Law he daily puts upon them; but as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.23. <hi>They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do buſineſs in great waters: theſe ſee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep: For he commandeth, and raiſeth the ſtormy winds, which lift up the waves thereof: they mount up to the heavens, they go down to the depths: their ſoul is melted, becauſe of trouble:</hi> the breaking of a wave would ſwallow them up. Who is he that maintaineth the continuity of the parts of the water that the waves break not, nor the water divideth under the mighty weight that is upon it? who but the mighty God could do it? In ſhort, he ſeemeth to have taken a very curſory, ſlight, and overly view of the Works of Creation, that doth not ſee a plain neceſſity of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:192227:35"/>a Divine Providence, to uphold the various Beings within the compaſs of it, and their various Qualities; to compound the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements of their natures, into an harmony proportioned to the preſervation of the Univerſe. <hi>Whoſo is wiſe, and hath obſerved theſe things,</hi> he muſt underſtand both the Power and Wiſdom of God in all theſe things, and conſequently the loving-kindneſs of the Lord. I ſhall ſhut up this with that Pious foot of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Song of Providence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. <hi>O that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, for his wonderful works to the children of men!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we conſider the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> we ſhall find that he <hi>who acknowledgeth a Divine Being, and denieth a providential care of all created Beings, hath but ſet up an idol in his heart, and rather owneth a God with his tongue, than in any truth and ſincerity.</hi> For what do we mean by that term <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>an immenſe Being filling all places, a firſt cauſe of all things; Almighty in power, of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite activity, wiſdom, and goodneſs?</hi> We can hardly ſo much as fancy ſuch a Being, but by the ſame conception, we muſt eſtabliſh a Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we allow not God to be the <hi>firſt Cauſe,</hi> we muſt grant a former cauſe of things; and this were to deny God, while we pretend to own him. It is as much <hi>nonſenſe</hi> to aſſert one before the firſt, as one higher than the higheſt. But how is God the firſt cauſe, if he hath no influence upon ſecond cauſes, nor they any dependance upon him? If they ſay that ſecond cauſes have a dependance on him, and he an influence on them; they eſtabliſh what we contend for, <hi>viz.</hi> a Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we allow God to be an <hi>immenſe and infinite being, filling all places:</hi> we muſt either allow him to fill all places <hi>as an oculate active being,</hi> or as a <hi>ſenſleſs inanimate being.</hi> A bulk of lead or ſtone filleth a place, but takes no notice of any thing in it: A man filleth a place which circumſcribeth him, but ſeeth and obſerveth all things. It were an high blaſphemy againſt God to affirm, that he filleth all places, only as a Log, or a bulk of Lead filleth a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place: if he filleth all places as an animate being, that hath eyes and ears, he muſt needs <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> and obſerve all things in all places which his Being filleth. Whoſo granteth this, doth in a great meaſure own and acknowledg a Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But this Doctrine is fully confirmed to us, if we will but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:192227:35"/>recognize God a being of <hi>infinite mercy and goodneſs.</hi> God is not like the Oſtrich, of which <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, 39.14. <hi>She leaves her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in the duſt: and forgetteth that the foot may cruſh them, or the wild beaſt may break them: ſhe is hardned againſt her young ones.</hi> It is our great vanity, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under a difficulty to conceive of any being above our own pitiful perfection and capacity, we fancy to our ſelves ſtrange <hi>Idea's</hi> of God. We can hardly apprehend an immenſe being that ſhould fill all places: if we could, we ſhould eaſily conclude a Divine Omniſcience. If we can fancy any thing of that, yet we are ready to conceive of him according to the lazy imperfections of our natures; and think of God, as of ſome great and mighty Prince, that hath either through inactivity, or for greater ſtate, mewed up himſelf in his Court, and gives up himſelf, inſtead of his buſineſs of Government, to divertiſements of pleaſure, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the care of Government upon his Counſellors, or ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Miniſters of State. Hence the miſtake of the old Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, of Gods Providence extending not to all, but to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Beings, obſerved to have a great influence upon ſublunary Beings. And our Judicial Aſtrologers ſeem to inherit, though not their wiſdom in all other natural things; yet their error in this: <hi>Aſtra regunt homines, ſed regit aſtra Deus</hi> (is their Song). But alas! this is but to ſet up an Idol in our hearts. And indeed, if we could conceive any earthly Prince to be preſent in every place, we could hardly imagine him ſo neglective of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What Prince will not rule all motions and actions which he ſeeth and heareth, to what he apprehendeth the wiſeſt and beſt ends for his own honour? So that if we could ſuppoſe an earthly Prince in all places, where he hath Children, Servants, or Subjects, and to have his ſenſes open, to ſee and hear them, he would certainly contribute his beſt help to preſerve and govern them. Eſpecially if he be a perſon of ordinary humanity, and goodneſs, and hath a ſufficiency of Power and Wiſdom. Do not we ſee how naturally the <hi>parent,</hi> to his finite capacity, careth for, preſerveth, and governeth the Child? How the Maſter of a Family cannot neglect a care for, and government of his Family, till he hath debauched himſelf to a beaſt? Nay, do not the birds of the air, and beaſts of the field naturally care for their young ſeed, and govern them? Whence had they their natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions and inclinations to this goodneſs towards thoſe, to whom
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:192227:36"/>they have ſtood in any order of cauſation? Was it not from the great Creator, who thus diſpoſed them? If it be a piece of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the creature ſo to care for, preſerve and govern its fellow-creature; certainly we muſt allow it to be ſo in God. What goodneſs of this nature there is in the creature, floweth from him, as the ſtream from the fountain: And is certainly much more in him, he having loſt nothing by the Communication of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhares to them. So that whoſoever will acknowledg a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is infinitely good, muſt alſo acknowledg that Being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely provident for the Creatures that derive from him: and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature thus deriving, God who wanteth neither Power nor Activity, muſt as naturally care for them all, as a Father or Mother careth for every Child, and a bird for every young one. And it is nothing but ſome mens Atheiſtical conceptions, and others more imperfect notions of God, not conſidering the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being in the extent of his <hi>Immenſity, Activity, Power,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which maketh any ſo much as in the leaſt to heſitate, as to the Doctrine of Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us once more turn our eyes <hi>to the ſtrange effects and events</hi> which we ſee in the world: of which we ſee great variety, and many of them which appear to us of great moment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Now ſuppoſing that there were not a Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence directing and governing them, and being the firſt cauſe to them, they muſt either be the products of ſo many <hi>Machines</hi> or <hi>Engines,</hi> moving neceſſarily; or of the <hi>imperate acts of ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures endued with wiſdom and counſel.</hi> We ſhall find the effects in the world ſuch as are impoſſible to be products of any ſuch nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Were they the products of the firſt, Man might have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious knowledg of, and not at any time be ſurpriſed by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Were they meerly the products of the ſecond, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could hardly be conceived, to have a previous certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of them, ſo as by his Prophets to give the world a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt, Were the effects we ſee in the world neceſſary, depending upon a certain fate, and moving in a certain order; What then hindereth, but man might have a <hi>certain previous know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> of them things which work neceſſarily, work certainly, and evenly? Thus indeed the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> and all natural agents move: Every Almanackmaker therefore will tell you how
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:192227:36"/>many hours the Sun will ſhine in a day, ſix, twelve months hence; when the Eclipſes ſhall be of either Luminary, and to what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they ſhall be obſcured. But can they alſo tell us when the next great Plague, the next Innundation, or Fire we ſhall hear of ſhall be? or when, and where ſhall be the next great mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in an Empire, or a Kingdom? We ſee men (ſometimes) infinitely ſurpriſed in the product of ſecond cauſes, ſo contrary to their expectation, and to what appeared to us would have been their probable effect. If things had moved by a Law of Fate, the world is now ſo old, that the courſe of its motions would have been matter of ſcience and demonſtration to us; but alas there is nothing leſs. Who can tell <hi>what to morrow will bring forth?</hi> not only as to his own particular concerns, but the far greater, and more general concerns and intereſts of mankind, and the Church of God in particular.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How then are they <hi>produced?</hi> Is it from the <hi>will of man?</hi> I ask whether from <hi>the wills of men working neceſſarily,</hi> as the firſt and only principle of them; or working freely, and at perfect liberty; the firſt ſurely none will aſſert that conſiders what he ſaith. If from the wills of men working freely, then they might alſo work and move otherwiſe than they do. Then I ſay it is hard to conceive, how God himſelf ſhould have a <hi>certain knowledg of things, previous</hi> to the <hi>event</hi> or <hi>effect;</hi> for there was no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch an event or effect. But that God hath ſuch a certain previous fore-knowledg, is evident from all the Prophecies, where by his Prophets, he foretold things that were to come to paſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds of years after; and that with all their circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The great effects of created Beings muſt have ſome cauſe, I mean ſome firſt cauſe: If this were Nature, or Fate, <hi>i. e.</hi> a neceſſary law impoſed upon them; their motions would be even, uniform, ſubjected to our art and fore-knowledg, which they are not. If the firſt cauſe of them be the wills of men, working upon choice, there could then have been no certainty of them before they had exiſted; for they might as well not have been, as have been. If any ſay, but though the wills of men move freely, yet he who calleth the things that are not, as if they were; he knew which way things ſhould be, and how the wills of men would move. This we moſt freely grant, but we alſo ſay, That he knew them, becauſe he willed either to effect, or to permit them; and that ſuppoſing this Decree of Providence, there muſt alſo be a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:192227:37"/>of it, upholding created Beings, conducting their effects, and many times over-ruling them: and this is that which we call <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. In a further evidence of this, I might call in a plentiful Teſtimony, from the moſt learned and wiſe amongſt the Heathens. But I ſhall not much trouble my ſelf or you with that diſcourſe; but refer thoſe that deſire to be ſatisfied herein, to the excellent diſcourſe of <hi>Du-Pleſſis</hi> Lord of <hi>Morney,</hi> in his Book of the <hi>True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> Chap. 13. where he ſheweth Providence a bundantly owned by <hi>Plato, Plotinus, Hierocles, Ariſtotle, Cicero, Seneca,</hi> and others. I ſhall therefore only add one paſſage of <hi>Seneca</hi> (not I think particularly by him mentioned); it is in his Book of <hi>Natural Queſtions,</hi> Chap. 45. where he calleth God, <q>The keeper and governour of the whole world:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cuſtodem, rectoremque univerſi, animum &amp; ſpiritum, mundani hujus operis Dominum &amp; artificem, cui nomen omne convenit. Vis illum fatum vocare? non errabis. Hic eſt, ex quo ſuſpenſa ſunt omnia, cauſa cauſarum. Vis illum Providentiam dicere? rectè dices. Eſt enim cujus conſilio huic mundo provide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ut inconcuſſus eat, &amp; actus ſuos expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,</hi> Seneca Nat. Qu. l. 2. cap. 45.</note> a Mind, a Spirit, the Lord, and Artificer [or Creator] of all the world, he to whom every name agreeth. Will you call him <hi>Fate?</hi> you will not be out. For he it is on whom all things depend. Will you call him <hi>Providence?</hi> you will ſay right; for by his Counſel the world is provided, and taken care for that it remains ſteady, and performeth its operations.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Salvian</hi> upon this Argument tells us, that the Heathens acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged God to be in the world, as the Maſter of a great Ship is in that, abiding always in it, and ſtirring up and down: Whence he cryeth out,

                     <q>What could they more religiouſly judg and ſpeak of God, than to compare him to the Governour of a Ship,</q> who is never in the Ship idle, but continually at work either in one kind or another? The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> compared God to the Soul in the body, filling each part, and actuating each part of the body. The <hi>Platoniſts</hi> call him <hi>the moderator of all things.</hi> The Heathen Poets ſpeak as well and fully. <hi>Virgil</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, God is continually moving throughout all the Earth, <hi>Tractuſ<expan>

                  <p n="5">5. But hitherto I have been arguing this point with you <hi>as men,</hi> to convince you of it if you were Heathens, and had no
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:192227:37"/>knowledg of the Holy Scripture. When I conſider you in that notion, I muſt ſay to you, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another caſe, <hi>We have a more ſure word of prophecy.</hi> As we by faith under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the worlds were at firſt made by God: ſo by faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we plentifully underſtand, that the <hi>created worlds</hi> are <hi>upheld, preſerved, protected,</hi> and <hi>governed</hi> by God. I ſhall hereafter more diſtinctly prove this in my following diſcourſe, when I ſhall come to ſpeak of the diſtinct and particular acts and objects of this <hi>Divine Providence.</hi> I ſhall only here make uſe of a few, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of very many Scriptures which might be produced, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <gap reason="foreign">

And I therefore ſhall not in this place fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlarge upon them, but come next to conſider the extent, or particular objects of Divine Providence. I proceed therefore to a ſecond Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What are the objects of Divine Providence? or how far doth the Divine care extend?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>Epicureans</hi> of old would acknowledg no <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and many of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> aſſerting a <hi>Fate,</hi> deſtroyed it; yet the wiſer <hi>Peripateticks</hi> would grant it, though but a limited one, extended to ſome particular Beings and things; and too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amongſt thoſe who are called Chriſtians, ſeem to inherit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their ſpirit. I remember that when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw <hi>Egypt</hi> almoſt deſtroyed, he calls for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and bids them <hi>go and ſerve the Lord:</hi> but adds, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.8, <hi>But who are they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:192227:38"/>that ſhall go?</hi> When <hi>Moſes</hi> replyed, <hi>We will go with our young, and with our old, with our ſons, and with our daughters, with our flocks, and with our herds will we go.</hi> He replyeth <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>Let the Lord ſo deal with me, as I let you go and your little ones.</hi> Thus many deal with God. When they conſider the vaſt bodies of the Creatures, the great varieties of their beings, and qualities, their motions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are forced to acknowledg a Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; That the world could not ſtand, nor the parts of it hold together, unleſs a Superior hand ruled, upheld, and governed them: They therefore will acknowledg a Providence, as to the great bodies of the Heavens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſay they, <hi>How far will you extend it?</hi> When they hear us aſſert it as to all things, the ſound of the <hi>little ones</hi> in nature, troubles them, yea, and as to the <hi>wills of men,</hi> they are wonderfully diſturbed. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enquire what the Scripture ſaith, which certainly cannot err, as to the bounds and extent of Gods <hi>Providential care.</hi> The Scripture tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>That all things are naked, and open before him with whom we have to do:</hi> That <hi>the eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good,</hi> Prov. 15.3. My Text ſaith, <hi>He preſerveth both man and beaſt.</hi> The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith, <hi>He upholdeth all things by the word of his power.</hi> But to ſpeak more diſtinctly; we extend the Divine Providence, 1. <hi>To all Beings.</hi> 2. To all <hi>motions and actions of Beings.</hi> 3. To all <hi>omiſſions, ſuſpenſions, or ceſſations of action.</hi> 4. <hi>To all events</hi> of things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, I ſay, to all <hi>Beings.</hi> Beings are uſually diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſuch as have no life, or ſuch as have life. Or if you pleaſe we may make uſe of that plain diviſion of Beings into, 1. Such as have no more <hi>than a meer Being,</hi> neither life, nor ſenſe, nor <hi>reaſon.</hi> Such are the Heavens, the Earth, the Waters. Or, 2. Such as have <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> but no ſenſe. Such are herbs and plants. Or, 3. Such as have <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>ſenſe.</hi> Such are <hi>Beaſts, Birds, Fiſhes, Inſects,</hi> &amp;c. Or Laſtly, Such as have not only <hi>Being, life, ſenſe,</hi> but <hi>Reaſon</hi> alſo. Such are <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> I ſhall ſhew you that Divine Providence extends to all theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſuch things as have meer Beings.</hi> As to the Heavens, <hi>Extol God</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt), Pſal. 68.4.33, <hi>Who rideth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heavens.</hi> Gods riding upon the Heaven ſignifies his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon them, and his Rule and Governance over them.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:192227:38"/>Our Saviour telleth us, That he maketh <hi>his Sun to ſhine,</hi> and <hi>his Rain to fall upon the juſt and unjuſt;</hi> yea, and God makes it a thing proper to him to <hi>give rain:</hi> and the Scripture tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you of his giving it, and withholding it at his pleaſure, as in the days of <hi>Elijah.</hi> Job 9.7, God is ſaid to be he <hi>who commandeth the Sun, and it riſeth not, and ſealeth up the ſtars.</hi> For the Earth, he is ſaid to <hi>hang it upon nothing;</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo great a weight would not hold there long, if it were not held up.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For thoſe things which have not a meer <hi>Being,</hi> but <hi>life</hi> alſo: they are the herbs, and plants, and <hi>flowers. He cauſeth the graſs to grow for the cattel,</hi> Pſal. 104.24. Pſal. 147.8, <hi>He maketh the graſs to grow on the mountains: He cloatheth the graſs of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the Oven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For thoſe Beings which have <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſenſe. He feedeth the fowls of the air,</hi> Matt. 6.18. <hi>Not a ſparrow falls to the ground without him:</hi> he called for the <hi>flies</hi> and <hi>locuſts,</hi> &amp;c. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the moſt perfect Beings, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Being, life, ſenſe,</hi> but <hi>Reaſon</hi> alſo; Theſe are either <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Men. Providence</hi> reacheth to both of theſe; it reacheth to the <hi>good Angels:</hi> he commandeth all his <hi>Angels</hi> to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Chriſt;</hi> he maketh his <hi>Angels Spirits,</hi> and <hi>his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters a flaming fire,</hi> Heb. 1.6, 7. and <hi>miniſtring Spirits for the good of his Elect.</hi> How frequently do you read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Gods government of his Angels, in ſending them upon his meſſages? For the Devils: the Old Teſtament tells you of his employing them againſt <hi>Ahab;</hi> of his commiſſionating them againſt <hi>Job.</hi> And the New Teſtament plentifully declares their ſubjection to the Son of God. For <hi>Men;</hi> the Scripture ſpeaks abundantly. My Text telleth you, <hi>He preſerveth man and beaſt.</hi> In ſhort, there is hardly a leaf in Scripture but abundantly confirmeth this piece of Divine Providence in one particular or other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay, the <hi>Providence</hi> of God extendeth not only to all Beings, but to all the <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Actions of Beings:</hi> uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to their motions, governing all their actions. The graſs groweth not, the ſparrow falleth not, the Lilly groweth not, without our Father: he hath made the Ordinances for the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, for the day and night. It is he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:192227:39"/>that <hi>thundereth out of Heaven,</hi> 1 Sam. 7.10. 2 Sam. 22.14. The Scripture every-where aſſerteth the influence of God upon the natural motions of all creatures; nor is it to be excluded from the <hi>voluntary Actions,</hi> whether good or bad. As for good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he moveth to them, he aſſiſteth in them. As to <hi>bad acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> he <hi>upholdeth as to the natural action,</hi> but hath nothing to do with the malice and wickedneſs of it, but to govern it, when ſhewed, to his own wiſe ends. The Scriptures are infinite which might be produced in the proof of this. What can be plainer than that of our Saviour ſpeaking of good actions, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3, <hi>Without me you can do nothing:</hi> that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me;</hi> and again, <hi>He giveth to will and to do.</hi> For bad actions, <hi>He ſuffered all Nations to walk in their own ways,</hi> Act. 14.16. And the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.10, <hi>Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee; and the remainder of wrath thou ſhalt reſtrain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Providence of God extendeth to all <hi>omiſſions, ceſſations,</hi> or <hi>ſuſpenſions of actions;</hi> yea, and to <hi>all irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of natural motions or actions.</hi> It was from God that the fire did not naturally act to conſume the three children; nor the Lions to devour <hi>Daniel</hi> though in their Den; that the Sun ſtood ſtill in the Valley of <hi>Ajalon;</hi> that it went backward, as appear'd by the ſhadow upon the Dial of <hi>Ahaz:</hi> and ſo as to actions depending upon the will of man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6, God ſaith to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that he <hi>ſuffered him not to touch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah; Jacob</hi> telleth his Wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.7, that God ſuffered not <hi>Laban to hurt him.</hi> Multitudes of Scriptures might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this caſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, The Providence of God extendeth to all <hi>events.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents are reducible to two heads; they are either ſuch as are <hi>good and grateful</hi> to us, or ſuch as are <hi>evil and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</hi> The hand of Providence is in both. There is no good event but is from God; he is the fountain of good, the author of every good and perfect gift: <hi>evil events</hi> are from him, <hi>Is there any evil in the City</hi> (ſaith God by <hi>Amos),</hi> and <hi>I have not done it? Afflictions ſpring not out of the duſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job).</hi> But the holy Scripture is ſo full of proof of this, as I need not give particular inſtances; eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that it hath been recognized by the children of God in Scripture, and is ſo by every one of us, ſo often as we either
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:192227:39"/>praiſe God for any receit of good, or deliverance from evil; or pray unto him for the collation of any good thing, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or removal of any evil. Thus now I have confirmed the Doctrine of Divine Providence, and alſo ſhewed you the extent of it. I ſhould now come to diſcourſe of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar acts of it; but firſt let me make ſome application of this general diſcourſe of <hi>Providence,</hi> ſo far as I have carried it on.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, obſerve from hence, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> 
                     <hi>how unreaſonably</hi> and <hi>Atheiſtically</hi> any deny the <hi>Providence of God,</hi> and that in the extent of it: <hi>Atheiſtically,</hi> for it is all one to <hi>deny a God,</hi> as to deny the Providence of God. If there be a God, there muſt be an infinite Being filling all places: infinitely active, all eye, all ear, all underſtanding, doing all that from his moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Eſſence, which we do by the help of our ſenſes, or any of our faculties. Now that God ſhould fill all places, ſee, hear, underſtand all things, motions, actions, events, and not rule, and govern all to the wiſe ends of his own glory, having a power ſo to do, is to fancy that of God, which cannot be preſumed of a man like our ſelves. Thoſe therefore that deny <hi>Providence,</hi> muſt have deceived their ſouls with ſome falſe idea's, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of God, and ſet up an idol in their hearts, inſtead of the true and living God; Either a finite and limited Being, not filling Heaven and Earth: or a dead, lazy, dull, careleſs inactive Being. All which is indeed to blaſpheme, to deny God inſtead of acknowledging him. 2. As it is Atheiſtical, ſo it is moſt <hi>irrational.</hi> I have formerly diſcourſed that, and therefore ſhall refer you to it. To fancy that the world could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved or governed in that order in which we ſee it, without an infinite God giving conduct to it, ordering it, and ruling it to his pleaſure, is to fancy that may be done caſually in ſo vaſt a place as the whole world, which we ſee cannot be in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle City or Family; than which nothing is more unreaſonable. 3. Nor thirdly is any thing more contrary to the Scripture, for there is no one propoſition of truth, that hath a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful evidence of Scripture, than this Doctrine of Providence hath. I beſeech you therefore to take heed of ſuffering any ſuch ſuggeſtion, any ſuch thought, or imagination, to poſſeſs your hearts: look upon it as a very great piece of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> to deny, or to diſpute it: beſides that, as I ſhall ſhew you by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:192227:40"/>and by; There is no Doctrine of greater uſe to ſettle and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Spirits under all the varieties of the world, nor to keep us in a more holy, quiet, patient temper, and in a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency upon God under all accidents which occur to us, than this Doctrine of Providence. Let this therefore be the firſt uſe and application of this excellent Doctrine, to ſettle your hearts in this point, ſo conſequential to a juſt, and due notion, and a right apprehenſion of him who is the living and true God.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Let me apply this by way of caution. You have heard that there is a Divine Influence upon all <hi>Beings,</hi> Motions, Actions, Events, &amp;c. But take heed of two things; 1. Of thinking that <hi>the Providence of God neceſſitates all moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and actions of voluntary Agents.</hi> Or, 2. <hi>That it gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuperſedeas to our own endeavours, with reference to Events.</hi> Some Agents indeed act neceſſarily, all but rational Agents do ſo; they have no <hi>reaſon,</hi> and conſequently, no counſel, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or election. But reaſonable creatures, ſuch as men and women are, have a <hi>Will,</hi> and act from it as from their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: theſe the Providence of God influenceth, but doth not compel or neceſſitate. The Providence of God influenceth a man to good actions, ſuggeſting them to him, moving him and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining him unto them, but not enforcing him. As to <hi>evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> the influence of Divine Providence is otherwiſe. God doth not ſuggeſt, not move, not incline the heart to them. It upholdeth the creature to the meer natural action. 2. It ſuffereth the ſinner to vent the malice and wickedneſs of his heart in the action. 3. It governeth the action when done, to the wiſe end of Gods glory. The influence of Providence neither neceſſitateth the child of God to do good, nor the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to do that which is evil. This is one thing you muſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily underſtand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed of thinking that the influence of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as to all events, ſuperſedeth any thing of lawful endeavours, in order, either to the obtaining a good, or preventing a bad event or iſſue.</hi> The influence of Gods Providence doth by no means juſtifie mans improvidence. There is a great deal of reaſon for this, if we duly weigh it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Providence is not our rule.</hi> We are to walk by the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> and to depend upon <hi>Providence.</hi> So that whatſoever the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:192227:40"/>word of God maketh our duty to be done, or uſed as a mean in order to the obtaining of any event, remaineth ſtill our duty, without reſpect to the influence which Providence hath upon events.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>The Providence of God doth ordinarily bring about events by our endeavours as means.</hi> It is an extraordinary work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Providence, when it bringeth about an event without humane means; it ordinarily brings them about in, and by the uſe of means: hence it is that we cannot regularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Divine Providence, without the uſe of proper means. So far is the influence of Providence from ſuperſeding the uſe of means. Thus the Providence of God neither deſtroyeth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor diſcourageth induſtry.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> I know no Doctrine of further uſe than this, <hi>for the comfort and relief of the ſpirits of Gods people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any of the afflictions of this life.</hi> The wheels of the world ſometimes run very croſs, not only to the expectations of Gods people, but to their ſenſible intereſts: I ſay, to their ſenſible and appearing intereſts, for contrary to what is their true and real intereſt they cannot run. <hi>All things ſhall work together for the good of them that love God.</hi> All things muſt be <hi>theirs,</hi> for their good, profit and <hi>advantage.</hi> But Gods diſpenſations to them in this life are ſometimes very afflictive, very ingrateful to their ſenſe. Now what a relief is this to a child of God to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this, to be rooted and confirmed in this, <hi>That there is a Divine Providence</hi> extending it ſelf to all the <hi>motions and actions of creatures;</hi> To all the <hi>ſuſpenſions, omiſſions,</hi> and ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of creatures action. Hence follow divers things, which may be of great relief to us under our diſquietudes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the omiſſions, ſuſpenſions, ceſſations of actions in means; yea, their workings contrary to our expectation, are things order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divine Providence.</hi> It is wonderful how great an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this thing ſometimes gives perſons of more thoughtful and reflexive tempers. We loſe a friend, and fancy, if ſuch or ſuch means had been uſed, or if ſuch or ſuch a thing had not been done, our husband, child, wife, had not died: you know what <hi>Martha</hi> ſaid to our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11, <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt been there, my brother had not died.</hi> But now ſuppoſe this, that if ſuch or ſuch a thing had not been done, in a natural courſe thy friend had lived: (for that is all thou canſt ſay), yet was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:192227:41"/>not the hand of God in it? had the Providence of God, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou, no influence upon the omiſſion of ſuch a means as was omitted, or the uſe of ſuch things as thou conceiveſt to have been pernicious? <hi>Doth not a ſparrow fall to the ground,</hi> and is thy friend (thinkeſt thou) fallen to the ground, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy Father? thy Father ordering the <hi>omiſſion of ſuch a mean as might</hi> have preſerved his life, or the uſe of ſuch things as haſtened their diſſolution. God often hides from us what ſhall be the proximate cauſe of our end, and ſo as to our friends. It is true, if we have knowingly, and wilfully omitted or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected probable means, we have cauſe of ſome reflection; but yet even in that caſe, the <hi>providence</hi> of God reaching to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents is ſome relief to us. In this ſenſe it is no blaſphemy to ſay, God often deceiveth the Phyſitian, and the ſollicitous friend; that is, ſuffereth them to err under falſe apprehenſion. There is not an omiſſion but <hi>Providence</hi> hath influenced, not a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion, or ceſſation of an uſual action in a natural agent, nor a contrary operation of it, but the <hi>Providence</hi> of God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced it. We, our friends, <hi>are of more worth than many ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi> and fall not to the ground but <hi>by the will of our heavenly Eather;</hi> ſo as we do but torment and diſquiet our ſelves in vain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the <hi>Providence of God influenceth all events,</hi> and that too, by <hi>effecting them,</hi> if not ſinful; <hi>They muſt, as to the people of God, be good,</hi> and <hi>for good,</hi> and <hi>the products both of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom, and of infinite goodneſs.</hi> It is our unhappineſs, that we judg of events to us in this world <hi>by ſenſe,</hi> and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>to faith.</hi> This maketh us call many things evil; indeed there is nothing can happen to a good man truly evil: for the hand of his Father muſt be in it. <hi>Providence</hi> muſt have the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of it, and never did the hand of a good Father, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly mix a potion of poiſon to his child, and with his own hand give it him to drink. We do not ask evil of God; and he that heareth our prayers, will not, when we ask him bread, give us a ſtone, nor when we ask him a fiſh, give us a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion. <hi>If we that are evil, know how to give good things to thoſe that ask them of us: much more doth our heavenly Father, know how to give good things to his children, asking them of him.</hi> In this we may be ſecure: If the Providence of God influenceth all the events of the world, he ſo regulates them, that although
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:192227:41"/>they may prove ſenſible, joyleſs, and afflictive evils; yet they ſhall never prove real evils to thoſe that fear God, but in the iſſue appear the products, as of infinite wiſdom, ſo alſo of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs. Thus far this Doctrine of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is a great fountain of conſolation to the people of God.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, Let us enquire what duty we may conclude from hence, and that is very much. I ſhall inſtance in ſome few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is there a Divine Providence? and doth this influence all beings, motions, actions, events, &amp;c? Let us learn then the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>faith,</hi> to <hi>commit all our ways unto God, to truſt in him, and depend upon him.</hi> It is a duty we are often in Scripture called to, and that with reſpect to our perſons, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our affairs and ways, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19, <hi>Wherefore let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their ſouls unto him, in well-doing as unto a faithful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> Our Saviour preſſeth it in oppoſition to two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In oppoſition to the <hi>fear of man,</hi> Matt. 10.28, 29, 30, <hi>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul. Are not two ſparrows ſold for a farthing, and one of them ſhall not fall on the ground without your Father? But the very hairs of your head are numbred. Fear you not therefore, for you are of more value than many ſparrows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, He preſſeth it in oppoſition to too great ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25. <hi>Therefore I ſay unto you, Take no thought for your life, what you ſhall eat, or what you ſhall drink, nor yet for your body, what you ſhall put on.</hi> This he preſſeth from Gods Providence, for the <hi>Lillies,</hi> the <hi>Birds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>With reſpect to our affairs, and the events of things in the world, ſo far as they concern us.</hi> 1. Pet. 5.7. <hi>Caſting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi> Pſal. 55.22. <hi>Caſt thy burden up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord, for he ſhall ſuſtain you.</hi> Pſal. 37.3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and do good.</hi> Verſ. 5. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord: truſt alſo in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſs.</hi> Prov. 16.3. <hi>Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts ſhall be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Man troubleth himſelf in vain, both with <hi>care</hi> and <hi>fear;</hi> the Child of God eſpecially. We cannot let God alone to rule and govern the world. But ſurely, if there be a God in the world,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:192227:42"/>an immenſe and infinite Being that filleth all places, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly active, ſeeing and hearing all things; and this God is not idle, but influenceth <hi>all beings,</hi> all motions and actions of beings, all ſuſpenſions, omiſſions, and ceſſations of action in the creature, all events; and if he hath any Children, people, or ſervants in the world, whom he loveth, delighteth in, careth for; theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may truſt him, and commit themſelves and their ways to him, and it is their duty ſo to do. Who may truſt God? who may commit their ways unto him, if theſe ſhould not? Let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.9, 10, 11. <hi>O Iſrael, truſt thou in the Lord: O houſe of Aaron, truſt in the Lord: you that fear the Lord, truſt in the Lord.</hi> Be not over-ſolicitous, be not ſinfully afraid as to any events. There is a God that ruleth in the earth, that overſeeth the world. But this truſting in God muſt be,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In <hi>doing good: Truſt in the Lord, and do good,</hi> Pſal. 37.3. Our ſouls muſt be committed to the Lord in well-doing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. <hi>There is no truſting in the Lord, without walking in his way.</hi> The unholy walking man hath no ground to truſt God for any good: he hath no promiſe to bottom his truſt upon. We muſt truſt God in an holy walking.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt, notwithſtanding the Providence of God, truſt God in the <hi>uſe of proper means.</hi> The reaſon for this is, becauſe the Precept commandeth the uſe of lawful means. Truſting of God is indeed excluſive of the uſe of unlawful means, but it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways includeth the uſe of means that are proper and lawful. To refuſe proper and lawful means, and talk of truſting God, is to tempt him not to truſt him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It includeth alſo the uſe of <hi>Religious means:</hi> ſuch as the waiting upon God in the uſe of his Ordinances. The word <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> and <hi>Prayer: For theſe things</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Prayer is a general means inſtituted by God for the obtaining of any mercy. But I ſay, ſuppoſing theſe three things: That a Child of God keepeth in the Lords way, and hath uſed all proper means for an event which he hath deſired, and ſought the Lord for by Prayer; This Doctrine of Divine Providence ſheweth him the higheſt reaſon imaginable, for his committing both his perſon, and his ways unto the Lord, without any anxious ſollicitude, or diſtracting, fears: Becauſe he is the Lord <hi>who careth for us,</hi> therefore we ſhould caſt our care on him.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:192227:42"/>2. A ſecond thing which I ſhall preſs upon you as your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and conſequent to this Doctrine of <hi>Providence,</hi> is a <hi>pious ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in all conditions, and with reſpect to all <hi>events.</hi> There is a ſinful ſecurity which all good men ought to avoid, and to take heed of. Security is the freedom of the mind from care, as to this or that thing. Now this is ſinful two ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>When the ground of it is ſome carnal confidence,</hi> a relying on ſome arm of fleſh. <hi>Curſed be he</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>that truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in man, and makes fleſh his arm.</hi> Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſecure upon the view of their great allies and confederates, <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi> In like manner people may be ſecure upon the account of their relations and intereſts, or the power and favour of men. We are commanded to <hi>ceaſe from man,</hi> whoſe breath is in his noſtrils; and the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, <hi>It is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in Princes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When there is a <hi>pretended confidence in God, but not conjoyned with an holy walking,</hi> nor with a due uſe of means, <hi>Natural, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> or <hi>Religious;</hi> take heed of ſuch a ſecurity as this is. That which I call a <hi>pious ſecurity,</hi> is the fruit of a <hi>confidence in God.</hi> When the minds of men upon the view of a <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> are quiet, and free from diſtractions, and over-much ſollicitude as to the events of things, whether relating to the Church, or to their own particulars. This I ſay is every good Chriſtians duty: and if there be ſuch a Divine Providence, as I have been diſcourſing of to you, it is the moſt reaſonable thing in the world. God is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rational Agent, and muſt work for ſome ends, and thoſe the beſt; the great end of his Glory, the ſubordinate end is the good of his People. Now if he hath in his working an influence on all beings, all motions and actions, all omiſſions, ſuſpenſions, and ceſſations of ſuch motions, all events, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainly that man or woman that loveth and feareth God, and keepeth his way, and hath uſed all proper means, natural, moral, or religious, in order to the obtaining of what he apprehendeth for Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the good of his Church, or his own particular good, he hath all imaginable reaſon to ſit down quiet, and be ſecure. Affairs in the world are upon the wheels, but thoſe wheels are <hi>full of eyes:</hi> God ſeeth all things, and his hand is in and upon all things, and hath his own ends in his eyes, and a power to turn all things, and to make them to ſerve his ends. We may in the darkeſt day cry out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.10. <hi>Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:192227:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>him, and the remainder of wrath he ſhall reſtrain.</hi> A good Chriſtian may ſit down, having done his duty, and leave the world to wag as it will. Let that great Ship wallow as it will, there is one that ſitteth at the Stern, that will guide it, and all its motions, it ſhall at laſt come into the true Port. Hence a Child of God hath reaſon enough <hi>in all things to give thanks,</hi> and at all times <hi>to rejoyce in the Lord, and again to rejoyce.</hi> What then mean the diſquietments, anxieties, and ſollicitudes of our thoughts? Are they not <hi>tacit</hi> denials, or ſuſpenſions of the workings of Divine Providence? Are they not Indications of the weakneſs of our Faith? Certainly if we had Faith in the Doctrine of Divine Providence, if it were but as a grain of muſtard-ſeed; we ſhould only attend our duty, and when we had done that, ſhould ſpeak to our ſoul, if yet in a tumult, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? why art thou diſquieted within me? Truſt ſtill in God, for I ſhall praiſe him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</hi> This is a ſecond piece of duty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third duty which this Doctrine of Divine Providence will evidence but reaſonable for us, is, <hi>A patient waiting for God under all the diſpleaſing varieties of this life.</hi> A duty which in Scripture you will find often called for by God, and his Holy Servants, who have ſpoke in his Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.7, 34. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is excluſive of all murmuring, repining, and diſcontentedneſs at any of Gods dealings; of all uſe of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular means to help our ſelves: it is an habit of grace, which in the midſt of the moſt adverſe and afflictive Providences, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> and to <hi>ſee the ſalvation of God.</hi> It is a great piece of a Chriſtians duty, keeping a Chriſtian in his ſtation, and in the paths of holineſs, under the moſt croſs and thwarting Providences, in the moſt dark and gloomy days, and the greateſt confuſions we ſee in the world. The failure of this is like the ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ballaſt in a Ship in a ſtorm: every Ship of burthen, that goeth to Sea, hath a <hi>Ballaſt</hi> of ſtones, or ſand, or ſome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thing, which keeps it even upon the waters; if in a ſtorm this Ballaſt ſtarts, ſo as it is thrown on one ſide, and gives not a juſt poiſe to the Ship, there is a great danger of a wrack, the Ship
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:192227:43"/>preſently lyes all on one ſide. Faith now is this Ballaſt, active patience, or waiting for God in a ſtorm of Providence, is that which keepeth the ſoul poiſed; if this Ballaſt ſtarts, there's great danger of the ſouls being overwhelmed. Now this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Providence,</hi> and the extent of it to all motions, actions, to all ſuſpenſions, omiſſions, and ceſſations of actions, to all events, and future contingencies, ſheweth us the duty and reaſonableneſs of this <hi>patient waiting.</hi> Is there a ſtorm, a whirlwind, an hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane of political motions in the world? It lets us know that God is in that ſtorm, God is in that whirlwind, that hurricane is not without the Lord, and God is not out of it. If the Enemies of the People of God could raiſe a ſtorm without the Lord, or when they have raiſed it ſhut God out of the Governance of it, it were ſomething; but they can do none of this: we can have no confidence in them, in the goodneſs of their natures, or their deſigns; but we may be confident of God, and wait for him. I compared Providence before, to a man of buſineſs, that ſeldom keeps a road; but ever and anon turns out this way, and that way, as his variety of buſineſs leads him; thoſe that will bear ſuch a man company home, muſt ever and anon wait for him, while he turneth out of his road. Let this Doctrine of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence have this kind influence upon your ſouls, to make you to wait upon God, whiles he hideth himſelf from the houſe of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and to look for him. It is good to wait upon God; for none yet that ever waited upon him, returned aſhamed; it is your duty to wait upon God, he is a <hi>great Soveraign,</hi> he hath required this homage from your ſouls. It is reaſonable you ſhould wait on him; for you may be ſure he is in every ſtorm, in every hurricane, ſeeing it, working by it, governing of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Doctrine of a <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> ſheweth the <hi>reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of a paſſive patience, or ſubmiſſion to, and contentation with our lot and portion in the world, under the moſt afflictive and adverſe iſſues.</hi> Nothing comes to paſs without the Will of God, not a ſparrow (as cheap, and inconſiderable a bird as it is) falleth to the ground without our heavenly Father. It is true, while we are in the world, we are in the midſt of briars and thorns; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to a thouſand accidents, which are afflictive to us, afflictions in our bodies, troubles in our ſpirits, croſſes in our relations, and in our affairs in the world; and no affliction is joyous, but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:192227:44"/>grievous. It is the great effect of Faith to make us <hi>glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations.</hi> But certainly, although this Doctrine of Providence doth not ſhew us a ſufficient ground to <hi>glory in tribulations,</hi> which is an exerciſe of grace moſt proper in ſuch Tribulations, as we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the name of Chriſt; as the Apoſtles <hi>went away rejoycing, that they were thought worthy to ſuffer any thing for the name of Chriſt.</hi> But ſurely the conſideration of this Doctrine of Gods Influence upon all events, all motions, all actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſheweth us a great reaſon why we ſhould be <hi>ſubmiſſive</hi> and <hi>patient,</hi> poſſeſſing our ſouls with patience under the moſt afflictive contingencies of this life. I remember <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> would not have the men of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> think that he was come out without God againſt that place. Is affliction come upon thee? Are croſſes in thy eſtate, in thy relations, come upon thee? Think not that any of them are come upon thee without God; the hand of God is in this ſickneſs, in this pain, in this depriving of thee of thy near relations; in this poverty that hath overtaken thee like an armed man. None of theſe things are come upon thee without God, 1. <hi>Willing them.</hi> 2. Nor without God <hi>influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them,</hi> ordering the cauſes of them: now if we do but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wiſdom and infinite goodneſs of this God; if we do but look upon him, as our <hi>Father,</hi> how cogently doth the Apoſtle ſpeak, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10, 11. <hi>Furthermore, we have had fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: Shall we not much rather be in ſubjection unto the father of our ſpirits, and live? For they verily for a few days, chaſtened us after their own pleaſure: but he for our profit, that we might be made partakers of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> How many arguments are there in two verſes to perſwade us to this ſubmiſſive patience? The main argument is from our <hi>reverent ſubjection to the Fathers of our fleſh.</hi> Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle concludes, that we ought much rather to be ſubject to the Father of our Spirits. 1. They were but the <hi>Fathers of our fleſh: he the Father of our ſpirits.</hi> 2. <hi>They chaſtened us after their own pleaſure, but he for our profit.</hi> But I ſay here is argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough, God is in the affliction, <hi>It is the Lord</hi> (ſaid that good man) <hi>let him do what ſeemeth to him good.</hi> Nothing can ſeem good to God to bring upon his people, but what truly and really is for their good; he cannot but give good things, diſpenſe and deal out good things unto his people: ſubmit your ſelves therefore unto God, under his ſevereſt Diſpenſations.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:192227:44"/>Remember he is in the ſtorm and whirlwind.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Doctrine of Providence may convince you of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of your duty of <hi>Prayer.</hi> 1. <hi>Daily Prayer.</hi> 2. <hi>More extraordinary, and ſolemn Prayer.</hi> I ſay firſt <hi>daily Prayer.</hi> Every day is pregnant with new deſigns. The world is a place full of a variety of Beings, and thoſe are in daily motion and action: hence we are ſubject to infinite accidents, and as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Who can tell what a day may bring forth!</hi> This ſpeaketh our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to ingrateful changes and mutations. Now certainly the ſame reaſon that teacheth us, if at any time we have any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of concernment to us (that may (if it goeth for us) be much for our advantage, if againſt us, much to our prejudice) to be diſpatched in <hi>Parliament,</hi> or any Court of Judicature; to apply our ſelves to thoſe perſons, to whom in thoſe caſes we may have acceſs, to intreat them to be our friends, and to lend us their aſſiſtance, ſhould alſo direct us to be as conſtant and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in our Applications unto God by <hi>Prayer.</hi> We have great concerns in the world every day, the concerns of our lives, our health, our ſucceſs and proſperity in our affairs, the concerns of all our friends and relations, above all, the concerns of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls. The good proſperity and welfare, or the evil and miſchief of them, all doth very much depend upon the motions and actions of other beings, as well as our own, upon the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ceſſations, and ſuſpenſions of their actions, upon the events, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now you have heard that the great God of Heaven and Earth filleth the world, influenceth all beings, motions, actions, ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuſpenſions, or omiſſions of action, all events; he is ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſeeing, and conſidering the matters of the world; Will not now Reaſon evince it to be our duty, to be much in Prayer alone, with our Families, morning and evening, to be crying to God, <hi>Proſper thou the works of our hands upon us?</hi> Reſtraint of Prayer from God, argues Atheiſm in our hearts, either that with the fool in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> we ſay in our hearts, <hi>There is no God:</hi> or elſe that we ſay, <hi>Tuſh God, ſeeth us not, the Almighty doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it lets us ſee the more eſpecial reaſonableneſs of more <hi>ſolemn and earneſt Prayer,</hi> upon more eſpecial Emergencies. I told you that every day is big of events, and <hi>who can tell what any day may, or will bring forth?</hi> But there are ſome more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial times, when we have more high and eminent concerns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:192227:45"/>ſome ſpecial undertakings, or when ſome eminent danger threateneth us. In reaſon here, our ſenſe of a Divine Providence influencing all events, all Beings, all motions and actions, of Beings, and all omiſſions, ceſſations, or ſuſpenſions of ſuch actions, doth more particularly oblige us, upon the emergency of ſuch affairs, to be more earneſt and importunate with God. It is the precept of <hi>Solomon, Acknowledg him in all thy ways, and he ſhall direct thy ſteps.</hi> And accordingly hath been the practice of the people of God; as you ſee it in the whole ſtory of holy Writ, and is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the people of God ſtill. Now this Doctrine of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence juſtifieth this practice of the children of God, as a very reaſonable practice; and evinceth as daily Prayer, ſo this more ſet and ſolemn prayer to be the reaſonable practice of all thoſe that have any knowledg of God, or any deſire to maintain fellowſhip and communion with him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, As it evinceth the duty and reaſonableneſs, both of daily, and of ſolemn and extraordinary pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: ſo it evinceth alſo the duty, both of <hi>daily,</hi> and more <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi> and <hi>extraordinary praiſes.</hi> We have not a good thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth unto us, but there is an hand of God in it: it may be ſome created Being hath been the inſtrument to bring it to our hand; but the action or motion of that created Being hath been influenced by God. The event or iſſue hath been ordered, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and directed by God; the hand of God is in every days health and protection, in every nights ſleep and preſervation. But this is obvious enough to every Chriſtian, of how mean a capacity ſoever. I ſhall therefore add no more to this part of my diſcourſe. I have, you ſee, hitherto <hi>proceeded</hi> no farther than to prove, <hi>That there is a Providence.</hi> 2. And <hi>to ſhew</hi> to you <hi>the exceeding great latitude of its objects.</hi>

I am now come to diſcourſe concerning the <hi>acts of God,</hi> by which he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this Providential care.

Only let me firſt premiſe two or three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is a <hi>more common and general preſervation of all beings,</hi> and a <hi>more ſpecial preſervation of ſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>there is a preſervation common</hi> both to <hi>man</hi> and <hi>beaſt,</hi> and a <hi>preſervation more peculiar to man; and yet more ſpecial to the people of God,</hi> thoſe amongſt the ſons of men, whom God hath ſet apart for himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That there is a preſerving Providence, <hi>reſpecting the body</hi> and <hi>outward man:</hi> and a <hi>preſerving Providence, reſpecting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That as to man he is conſiderable in a <hi>threefold capacity.</hi> 1. In his <hi>perſonal capacity,</hi> as a reaſonable creature, endued with all the powers and faculties of <hi>vegetive</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive creatures:</hi> and further, with ſeveral powers, and faculties ſuited to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable nature. 2. In his <hi>Political capacity,</hi> as he makes up a member of a Kingdom, or civil ſociety. 3. In his <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal capacity,</hi> as in ſociety with others he makes up that body of people which is called <hi>the church of God.</hi> God preſerveth him in all theſe capacities; of which (when I come to it) I ſhall ſpeak more particularly, and diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall lay down ſeveral concluſions. The firſt of which ſhall be more general and extenſive to ſuch creatures as have meerly being, and no life. The other will concern <hi>living creatures,</hi> and amongſt them men, as the nobler and more excellent of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:192227:47"/>1. <hi>Concl. God by the word of his power upholdeth the Beings, order, and courſes of all his creatures; ſo as not only their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclinations, and qualities, and affections, by which they are mutually ſerviceable to each other, and to the upholding of the univerſe, do not fail, abate, or decay, but ſo, that their power and oppoſite qualities work not to the ruin and deſtruction of the whole.</hi> This now to him who will give his thoughts leave to ſtand upon it, will appear a great and wonderful work of God, and no leſs than a wonderful miracle of Divine Providence. When God gave a being to the world, and to all the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he indued them all with ſeveral qualities, according to his infinite wiſdom; he ſet them in an excellent order, ſo as they might be mutually ſubſervient one to another, and all of them to the whole: he did not only make the world, but he <hi>fitted and jointed it together,</hi> ſo that one part of it correſponded with the other. 2. <hi>He indued them with ſeveral qualities,</hi> by which they are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſerviceable each to other. 3. <hi>He ſet the ſeveral creatures in their orders and ſtations,</hi> ſo as they might be beſt ſerviceable. Now, I ſay, the Providence of God worketh in the preſerving of them. 1. By <hi>upholding theſe qualities,</hi> and keeping them in this order, that they do not diſlocate and fall out of joint, but abide both in their ſtation, and in their full vigor and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>By keeping them that the qualities in them, which are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite one to another, and would naturally encline them to a diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and falling out of order, yet have no ſuch operation, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any ſuch effect;</hi> but even inanimate Beings, move and work orderly according to the Creators intention, though they do nothing out of any counſel, choice, or deliberation. Let me but illuſtrate this a little, in the four great Inanimate Bodies of the World; the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the mighty <hi>Waters.</hi> All exceeding great, and vaſt bodies, yet without life, ſenſe, or reaſon; ſo as their motions cannot be from reaſon and counſel of their own. The order in which God ſet theſe things in the day of Creation was this, The <hi>Heavens he placed uppermoſt,</hi> the <hi>Air in the midſt</hi> betwixt them and the Earth. Then he placed the Earth; and <hi>the Seas in the midst,</hi> contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one to another. In the Heavens he placed Waters, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, all great bodies. Now all theſe bodies have ſeveral qualities; <hi>Gravity,</hi> or <hi>weight, levity, heat,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:192227:48"/>cold, moiſture,</hi> &amp;c. Who knoweth not that <hi>active qualities</hi> in creatures are ſubject to ſpend, waſte, and decay? To inſtance but in that one body of the Sun, whoſe great qualities are <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat:</hi> We ſee candles, and torches, and fires give light and heat; but they ſpend themſelves, their light goes out, their heat waſtes, and ſpends it ſelf in a ſhort time. How is it that it is not ſo with the Sun, and the Stars, but from the power of God that upholds theſe qualities, that they neither waſte nor abate from their continual motion? The candle is fed from the tallow, and wax; the torch, and taper from <hi>pitch, wax, rozin,</hi> and other combuſtible matter; when that fails, it expireth. Whence is the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> fed? but from the immediate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding power and hand of God? Again, theſe great bodies are not indeed ſo groſs, and heavy, as mere ſublunary and terrene bodies are; but yet, they muſt not be denied ſomething of weight, eſpecially the <hi>Waters</hi> in the Heavens. We know weight and heavineſs is of the nature of Water; yea, of that Water which falleth from Heaven: how come the Clouds which are a thin body, to contain and reſtrain it, and keep it as in bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles? how come thoſe vaſt bodies of Water to be contained in the thin body of the Clouds, and to diffuſe themſelves ſo gradually upon the Earth?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us look upon the <hi>Air,</hi> from the agitation of which <hi>proceed the great and boiſterous ſtormy winds.</hi> The Air is cold, and moiſt, only heated and warmed from the Sun: how comes it to paſs, that it is not in that continual agitation, which we ſee it in ſometimes? ſometimes we hardly diſcern it moved at all, ſometimes more violently, and that ſometimes from one quarter, ſometimes from another; is this a natural, a meer natural motion? then it is neceſſary, and would be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: ſo we ſee it is not. Who can give a reaſon ſufficient to ſatisfie an inquiſitive Philoſopher, of the <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> in the Air in ſeveral Countrys, nay, in our own Country? or a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon of drought and moiſture in the Air? whence is it think you, that it is not always dry, nor always moiſt; not always ſtormy, nor always calm, none of which would ſuit the conſervation of the world, but from Gods upholding thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in thoſe bodies which influence it, and by which theſe things are cauſed? ſo that unleſs when the ordinary Providence of God is not withheld from the creatures, in ſome particular
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:192227:48"/>places, for the chaſtiſement of the wickedneſs of them that dwell therein. The Air keeps its motion, and courſes: the winds their courſes, for the preſervation of our bodies, and the advantage of humane affairs. God, I ſay, by a daily providence upholds theſe Beings to thoſe motions, and meaſures of motion, which he at firſt ſet for them, in order to keeping the World in joint. The Air putrifieth not, nor groweth infectious; the Winds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blow, ſometimes are ſtill, &amp;c. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> giveth God the great glory of his Providence, in this particular, very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully. <hi>He raiſeth the ſtormy winds,</hi> Pſalm 107. <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>He walketh upon the wings of the wind,</hi> Pſalm 104.3. <hi>He bringeth the winds out of his treaſures,</hi> Pſalm 133.7. <hi>He cauſeth his winds to blow,</hi> Pſalm 147.18. <hi>The ſtormy winds fulfil his word,</hi> Pſalm 148.8. The <hi>Heathens</hi> had ſuch a ſenſe of the Neceſſity of a Divine Providence to rule this Creature, that they deviſed a God on purpoſe (whom they called <hi>Aeolus</hi>) whom they feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a care and dominion over them: and the Poet ſaith, That if he did not, they would confound Heaven, and Earth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the <hi>Air</hi> let us come to the <hi>Earth,</hi> a great and vaſt body. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>It hangeth upon nothing,</hi> Job 26.7, upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Almighty power of divine Providence. It hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the midſt of the Air, and that upon nothing God did hang it there, in the day of Creation: the Seas are contiguous to it, both of them make but one Globe, or round body of a great weight. We ſee it is of the nature of weighty Bodies to incline and preſs downward. Suppoſe God did at firſt hang it there, What is it keeps it there? We ſhould conclude it a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, not to be effected by other than a divine Power, to ſee but a great ſtone, or <hi>Canon-bullet</hi> hang in the air; how would a whole City come out, and be aſtoniſhed at ſo great a ſight? eſpecially, if it ſhould hang there a month, or a year, or any conſiderable proportion of time. But who ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templateth this great ſight? Who thinks on the immenſe weight of the Earth, and the Seas, hanging in the midſt of the thin bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the air? Let the Atheiſts of this generation come near, and ſee this great ſight! If there be no God, or if this God exerciſeth no Providence in the upholding and governing created Beings: How cometh the Earth to hang upon nothing? or how doth it abide one day in that ſtation? Let any of them in an open field
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:192227:49"/>climb up, and hang up a Cannon-bullet ſo if they can. I know the Philoſophers tell us, it is in its Center, and every thing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſts there. The Poet tells us, That <hi>Ponderibus librata ſuis.</hi> But this is all but an idle and an impertinent muffling us with unintelligible terms: for what do they mean by the <hi>center of things,</hi> the center of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> or <hi>the center</hi> of the Earth, or of the Waters, unleſs they underſtand the place which God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for them, or wherein God fixed them in Creation? in that they abide, and we ſay, there Providence keepeth them. Let them try if the art of all the men in the World can ſo poiſe a great weight in the air, that it ſhall not fall, but abide hanging there any conſiderable time.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, let us view the great <hi>body of the Waters,</hi> in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual flux and reflux; whether they be placed higher than the Earth, is a little queſtion: But ſuppoſe they be not, certain it is, that the winds oft raiſe them much higher than the Earth: they are of a fluid Nature, of a great weight, in continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whence is it that they do not drown the World, or at leaſt a great part of it? It is a matter of demonſtration, that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, they riſe higher every ſide than the Earth next adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to them: How comes it, that the Sands check them, that in many places, they bring their bridle in their mouth, an huge quantity of ſmall ſtones or ſands, which make a bank on every ſide to protect the adjacent Earth againſt their rage? certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no reaſon can be given, but what the holy ſervants of God have long ſince given. <hi>Job</hi> 26.10, <hi>He hath compaſſed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22, <hi>He hath placed the ſand for a bound to the ſea, by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual decree, that it cannot paſs.</hi> Now ſuppoſe ſuch a Decree, theſe inanimate Creatures obey it not out of <hi>election and choice,</hi> but being natural Agents, they work and move neceſſarily accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the affections and inclinations, which God hath created them with. So as the water being fluid, and heavy, would from a neceſſity of natural working, overflow and drown the Earth, did not God by his Providence continually work, eſtabliſhing his Decree, and ſeeing to the execution of it; and to that end governing theſe inanimate Creatures, contrary to their natural inclinations, that the World may be kept in order, knitted and jointed together; and the qualities and affections of one creature may not work to the ruin and prejudice of another, and ſo to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:192227:49"/>the ruin and deſtruction of the whole. And thus I have opened to you my firſt Concluſion, ſhewing you the Method and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gods working in the preſervation of his creatures: in their beings, ſtations, and orders; and in upholding the uſeful qualities of them, that they do not waſte or decay; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining and governing of their oppoſite qualities, that they ſhall not work according to their natural tendencies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to deſtroy the World, or ſpoil the beauty, comelineſs, and order of it. Nor do they tranſgreſs, but upon Gods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing this Providence, this ordinary Providence. Whence come inundations of Waters, infections in the Air, ſtrange mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Celeſtial bodies in ſome places, as the juſt, and wiſe God at any time, will pleaſe to make uſe of any part of the hoſts of his Creatures, to execute his Vengeance; either upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons, Countries, or places. But thus much ſhall ſerve to have been ſpoken for the illuſtration of the firſt Concluſion. The others will reſpect ſuch creatures, as have <hi>life and ſenſe.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Concl. 2. <hi>God preſerveth his creatures which have life; or life, and ſenſe; or life, ſenſe, and reaſon; by a daily providing for them food, and nouriſhment, and directing them to their proper food, and an ordinary avoiding of what is noxious, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to their bodies.</hi> Of living Creatures there are three orders: 1. Such <hi>as have nothing but being and life;</hi> ſuch are <hi>Plants,</hi> and <hi>Herbs.</hi> 2. <hi>Such as have not only being, and life, but alſo Senſe.</hi> Such are <hi>Birds</hi> in the Air; <hi>Beaſts, and creeping things in the Earth;</hi> Fiſhes in the Sea; <hi>Inſects, and other creatures,</hi> that live on the Earth, and in the Air, which the <hi>Birds,</hi> and Fowls alſo do. 3. <hi>Such as have not only being,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>ſenſe,</hi> but alſo <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Theſe are (upon the Earth) only Men, and theſe only have Bodies. All theſe creatures <hi>having life,</hi> and that in a bodily ſubſtance: and ſo being in continual motion, are of mutable periſhing, and decaying beings; and the lapſes and decays of their Natures muſt be daily repaired by nouriſhment; to the taking of which, they are naturally inclined, by the <hi>paſſions</hi> of <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirſt:</hi> and by this Nouriſhment all know that all ſorts of creatures are preſerved, and without this they cannot live. Now as to this, the Providence of God is eminently ſeen in three things inſtanced in, in this ſecond Concluſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God provideth it for them.</hi> All Vegetables; <hi>Trees, herbs,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:192227:50"/>plants,</hi> are nouriſhed by <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>moiſture.</hi> The moiſture is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the natural fatneſs of the Earth, or the adventitious dew of Heaven, or falling of water from thence, either in a more fluid form, which we call <hi>Rain;</hi> or congealed, as Snow, and Hail. The heat is from the Sun. There is a natural moiſture in the Earth; it is alſo in part watered from the Springs and fountains of water into it, from the contiguity of the waters to it; but we ſee in a time of drought how all theſe fail. The Earth is parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and dry; God reneweth its moiſture by ſhowers from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; by <hi>Rain,</hi> and <hi>Snow,</hi> and <hi>Dew,</hi> &amp;c. Moiſture alone will feed ſew plants, if any. They muſt have heat, as well as moiſture; Some, and the moſt muſt have the beams of the Sun, all muſt have the heat of it diffuſed through the Air. Now who is he, who in the Heavens <hi>hath ſet a Tabernacle for the Sun, which as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom cometh out of his Chamber, and rejoyceth as a ſtrong man to run his Race?</hi> Is it not Gods? <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.4, 5. Our Saviour tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5, <hi>He maketh his Sun to ſhine, and his rain to fall upon the juſt, and upon the unjuſt.</hi> The <hi>Heathens</hi> lay under ſo much conviction of this, that their Poets feigned a Chariot of the Sun, which none but their God <hi>Phoebus</hi> could drive, without burning the World. For the Rain, how plentifully doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture give unto God the Prerogative of it. <hi>Hath the rain a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> or <hi>Who begot the drops of dew?</hi> Job 38.28, <hi>He cauſeth it to rain upon the earth,</hi> 26. <hi>He giveth rain,</hi> Jer. 5.24. <hi>He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth lightnings with rain,</hi> Jer. 10.3; Yea, and <hi>none but he can do it,</hi> Jer. 14.22. <hi>Are there any amongſt the vanities of the Gentiles that can cauſe rain?</hi> or <hi>can the Heavens give ſhowers? Art not thou he, O Lord our God? therefore will we wait upon thee, for thou haſt made all theſe things.</hi> Thus the Lord provideth food for <hi>vegetables.</hi> The ſenſitive Creatures are the Birds, and Fowls of the air, the beaſts, and creeping things of the Earth; the Fiſhes of the Sea: Theſe live partly upon herbs, and plants, and the ſeed, grain, and fruit of them; partly upon each other, the greater devouring the leſſer. God in providing a nouriſhment for herbs, and plants, provides a nouriſhment for the moſt of them; as alſo by upholding the procreating virtue of ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he provideth food for others. Man liveth upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of inferiour order to him; partly upon vegetables, herbs, roots, the fruits of plants; partly upon ſenſitive creatures. God hath given him a commiſſion to <hi>Kill, and Eat.</hi> God provideth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:192227:50"/>food for Man, by upholding the budding, germinative, ſeed-bearing qualities of plants, and the growing vertues of them, and by upholding the procreative vertue of birds, beaſts, fiſhes, &amp;c. without which thoſe ſpecies would fail from the Earth, and Man who lives upon them, would periſh alſo,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, The workings of Divine Providence are ſeen in <hi>directing them to their proper food.</hi> Whence is it that each crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture knoweth its proper food, and is inclined by its appetite to that only? Let me, as to theſe two things, ſhew you how plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Scripture ſpeaketh. God takes the glory of this, <hi>Job</hi> 38, <hi>Wilt thou hunt the prey for the Lion? or fill the appetite for the young Lion?</hi> V. 39, <hi>Who provideth for the Raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, when they wander for want of meat?</hi> Our Saviour telleth us, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.26. That it is God, <hi>who feedeth the young Ravens.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> giveth God the glory of this, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 104.27, <hi>Theſe wait all upon thee, that thou maiſt give them their meat in due ſeaſon: That which thou giveſt them they gather, thou openeſt their hand, they are filled with good.</hi> Theſe all wait upon thee: Who are theſe? the <hi>wild aſſes.</hi> V. 11, <hi>He ſendeth the ſprings into the valleys, which run amongſt the hills: they give drink to every beaſt of the field, the wild aſſes quench their thirſt.</hi> V. 14, <hi>He cauſeth the graſs to grow for the Cattel, and herbs for the ſervice of man, that he may bring forth food out of the Earth, and wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oyl to make his face to ſhine, and bread which ſtrengtheneth mans heart.</hi> V. 21, <hi>The young Lions roar after their prey, and ſeek their meat from God.</hi> V. 30, <hi>Thou reneweſt the face of the Earth.</hi> God at firſt ſaid, <hi>Let the earth bring forth graſs,</hi> Gen. 1.11. <hi>He ſendeth the graſs of the field,</hi> Deut. 11.15; <hi>He cauſeth it to grow for the cattel, and herb for the ſervice of man.</hi> He multiplyeth the beaſts of the field, the birds, and fowls of the air. <hi>He leaveth us not without witneſs, but giveth fruitful times, and ſeaſons, filling the hearts of men with food, and gladneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. From <hi>whence is it, but from the influence of God, upon his Creatures, that Creatures univerſally, and ordinarily avoid the eating of ſuch things as would be noxious to them,</hi> and many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if they be diſtempered, are directed to ſuch things as will cure them? But this is enough to have ſpoken to the ſecond <hi>Concluſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Concl.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>God preſerveth living Creatures, by uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:192227:51"/>thoſe faculties in all living creatures, upon the operations of which their lives are preſerved, their ſpecies are propagated, and they are to propagate their ſpecies, and to perform thoſe actions which are proper to their ſeveral Beings, and natures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To uphold the Creation, as to thoſe things in it which have life, there are divers faculties neceſſary which muſt be upheld: here are four ſorts mentioned in the Concluſion. Let me ſpeak a little to each of them. It will be of excellent uſe to convince you of the neceſſity of a Divine influence, or Providence upon you every moment. 1. The firſt ſort are thoſe: <hi>By which the Beings, the lives, and beings of Creatures are preſerved, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to their due proportion.</hi> Theſe are thoſe which belong to thoſe principal faculties, which the Philoſophers calls <hi>Facultatem altricem, &amp; auctricem:</hi> (I will put them together) and inſtance in divers particulars. We are craving, changeable creatures, ſubject to waſts and decays in our beings; and we muſt have a <hi>Nutritive faculty,</hi> or we could not live: The action of this faculty is called <hi>Nutrition,</hi> or Nouriſhing. Now our nouriſhing depends upon our food, the change of our food in our ſtomachs by the natural heat of our ſtomachs; and this dependeth upon ſeveral powers, which God hath created in all ſenſitive creatures; in the upholding of which, the daily Providence of God is wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experienced, although poſſibly, not ſo wiſtly obſerved, and conſidered by us as it ought to be. Let me a little awaken you to a due conſideration of it, by inſtancing in ſeveral Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, We <hi>have a power, a natural power to crave and deſire food.</hi> Without an appetite the creature deſires no food, can take none, though it be ſet before him; but inſtead of it, the very ſight of it maketh him ſick: he loatheth and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, and calleth to have it taken away out of his ſight, as we ſee in daily experience. Now I would know by what this faculty is upheld, but by the concourſe and daily operation of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? I do not intend to divert here into a Philoſophical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, concerning the cauſes of a decay of our appetite. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to tell you, that the cauſes may be various, and the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the cauſes, which may produce ſuch an effect, is ſufficient evidence, that nothing but the upholding power of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence can hinder it. It is God that muſt give us our daily food, and it is God that muſt give us a ſtomach, or appetite to it; and the cauſes are ſo many which may abate and deſtroy our
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:192227:51"/>appetite, that did not God daily watch over us, and influence us, as to this very thing, it were an hard thing to conceive, how it ſhould keep preſerved a few days, much leſs as it is with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to very many years.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſe us to have an appetite (to ſay nothing of our power to take, and chew, and ſwallow our food); We ſee by a daily experience, if we have not a power to <hi>digeſt it;</hi> if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat of our ſtomachs be from any cauſe abated, ſo as it will not change our food, and this continueth upon us for any time, and no remedy can be apportioned to it, the creature dyeth, whether it be man or beaſt. If the nap of the ſtomach be but worn off, our bodies ſoon appear thredbare; we pine away, and preſently ſink into our graves: by which we learn, that a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculty, power, or ability to digeſt our food, is neceſſary to the preſervation of our beings. As I ſaid before of the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, ſo I ſhall ſay again of this. I intend no diſcourſe of the variety of cauſes, from which ſuch a thing may proceed, but the poſſibility of ſuch a thing, and that as an effect of various cauſes, evinceth a neceſſity of a daily influence of God upon us, to uphold this faculty in its vigour and efficacy, which miniſtreth to our nutrition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But thirdly, ſuppoſe our food taken into our bodies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, and digeſted in our ſtomachs that it may nouriſh the whole body; it muſt be by ſeveral veſſels and channels diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſeveral parts of the body. So as there muſt be ſuppoſed a <hi>freedom</hi> from <hi>obſtructions in thoſe paſſages,</hi> and an <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive vertue and faculty in the ſeveral parts.</hi> If theſe paſſages be any way ſtopped, or the <hi>attractive vertue</hi> abated, the parts are not nouriſhed, but decay and wither, the creatures being deſtroyed. Of ſuch obſtructions we have daily examples: and indeed, whoſo conſidereth the various paſſages in our bodies, through which that part of our food, which proves for nouriſhment paſſeth, and the variety of obſtructions to which we are ſubject, muſt needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain acknowledg, that our Souls muſt be kept in life, our bodies in health, meerly by a Divine Power.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again, What we take into our bodies for our proper food, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in part, found either not proper for us, or in too great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; when the ſtomach hath done its office, <hi>there is a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> made, that not proper for us, or in a ſuperfluous proportion for that end, muſt be voided and caſt out; and a <hi>natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:192227:52"/>to do it, muſt be ſuppoſed,</hi> which if it ceaſeth but for a while, or the freedom of the paſſages, by which it paſſeth be obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the life of the creature quickly determineth. Now, whoſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth the variety of powers, and faculties in a living body, which muſt be all upheld, and the variety of cauſes, from which they may be incumbred, yea and quite deſtroyed; will be forced to acknowledg the inceſſant influence of Divine Providence, in upholding, and preſerving both the being and well-being of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature that hath a ſenſitive life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But yet here is not all: For in order to our nouriſhing, <hi>not only thoſe faculties in the body nouriſhed, which I have mentioned, muſt be upheld; But alſo the faculties, and vertues in the bodies nouriſhing, by which they are made nouriſhing to us.</hi> In all nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, there muſt be a body giving the nouriſhment, as well as a body receiving it: each of theſe muſt have its faculties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, or there will be no nutrition, and conſequently no preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of life. Philoſophy telleth us, that the nouriſhment of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bodies muſt be, 1. <hi>Something that hath a capacity to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſubſtance of our bodies,</hi> elſe how can it nouriſh? Hence it is, that a man cannot feed, or be nouriſhed, by <hi>ſtones,</hi> or <hi>dirt:</hi> there is not in theſe things a capacity to be turned into humane fleſh. 2. It muſt have <hi>ſomething of contrariety in it to the body nouriſhed,</hi> otherwiſe the ſtomach would make no alteration of it. And 3. <hi>It muſt have in</hi> it <hi>ſomething of ſimilitude,</hi> elſe it would never incorporate with us, and join it ſelf to our fleſh, or mix it ſelf with our blood. All our food muſt have ſome quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in it, that muſt be accommodate to our nouriſhment; and theſe qualities, or faculties muſt be upheld in it, and upheld too in ſome due proportion. Hence we ſee, that food when corrupted and putrified, and ſo hath loſt theſe faculties and vertues, and they be extinguiſhed, it inſtead of nouriſhing us, breeds diſeaſes, and deſtroyeth us. Now God preſerveth the life and being of his creatures, by a daily concurrence of his Providence, as well by upholding the nouriſhing vertues and qualities of their food, as thoſe natural faculties, by which they crave, concoct, and digeſt, or attract their nouriſhment; or expel, and throw out that part of it which is not proper for the nouriſhment of their bodies. But this is enough to have ſpoken as to that firſt principal Faculty, by which the life, and being of all ſenſitive living creatures are preſerved.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:192227:52"/>2. A ſecond <hi>principal Faculty</hi> by which the life of creatures is preſerved, is that of <hi>Reſpiration</hi> or breathing, which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the breaſts and lungs by which they draw in air, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain puff it out, thus continually cooling the heat of the heart, which would elſe ſoon determine the life of the creature. A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſo neceſſary, that we daily ſee with what difficulty the creature liveth, when it is any way incumbred; daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience we have of this in perſons ſick of Conſumptions, or Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's, &amp;c. When any living creature is once wholly deprived of this, it preſently dieth. This God giveth and maintaineth: <hi>He giveth to all Life, and Breath, and all things,</hi> Acts 17.25. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taketh it away; <hi>Thou takeſt away their breath, and they die</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt),</hi> Pſalm 104.29. God is ſaid to be the God, <hi>who ſpreadeth forth the Earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people, and ſpirit to them that walk thereon,</hi> Iſa. 42.5. Now God preſerveth both man and beaſt, by upholding this power or faculty in them, by which they draw in, and puff out the air: yea, and his daily Providence appeareth alſo in the preſerving of the air which they ſuck in, ordinarily, from ſuch affections and qualities as would deſtroy life in his creatures: I ſay, ordinarily, to except thoſe ſpecial remiſſions of Divine Providence in this caſe, by which God ſometimes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth perſons and places by a noxious and infected air, as the procreative cauſes of more Epidemical ſickneſſes and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. And this ſheweth us, how reaſonable a thing it is, <hi>That all that hath breath ſhould praiſe the Lord,</hi> according to the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> exhortation, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 150.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A <hi>third principal Faculty,</hi> neceſſary to the <hi>upholding</hi> of the <hi>life</hi> and being of creatures, is that by <hi>which</hi> they <hi>ſleep,</hi> and <hi>take</hi> their alternate reſt: <hi>Quod caret alterna requie durabile non eſt.</hi> Experience tells us, that we can live very little while without <hi>ſleep;</hi> we muſt therefore have a <hi>power to ſleep.</hi> There is no living creature that is always aſleep, or always awake; we muſt have a power to ſleep, and a power to awake again, or we cannot live. Some ſleep more, ſome leſs, all muſt ſleep ſometime. <hi>Sleep</hi> is a ceſſation of the <hi>common ſenſe</hi> and the exterior <hi>ſenſes from action.</hi> The Eye ſeeth not, the Ear heareth not, &amp;c. Now this is cauſed (ſay the Philoſophers) from the aſcending up of vapors out of the ſtomach, which ſtop the paſſage of the animal ſpirits from the brain; which vapours when they are ſpent, and the paſſages
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:192227:53"/>are clear again, man <hi>waketh,</hi> and the ſenſes return to their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. Be the cauſe what it will, certain it is, it is neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the <hi>holding of our ſouls in life:</hi> we muſt have a power both to ſleep and to wake, and this power muſt be preſerved; and by the upholding and preſerving of this power and faculty, both men and beaſts are upheld, preſerved, and kept alive. Now I ſay, this is Gods work; he that made the <hi>deep ſleep</hi> at firſt to <hi>fall upon Adam</hi> in the day in which he was created, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.21; makes ordinary ſleep to fall upon all living creatures. <hi>He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſleep to his Beloved,</hi> Pſalm 127. <hi>v</hi> 2. It is a piece of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.24, <hi>Thou ſhalt lie down, and thy ſleep ſhall be ſweet. David</hi> complained, that <hi>God held his eyes waking,</hi> Pſalm 77.4. And thus I have ſhewed you, how <hi>God preſerveth both man and beaſt,</hi> by upholding and preſerving thoſe powers and faculties in their Bodies, by which they are kept in life, and their Being is preſerved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But both men and beaſts are very ſmall when they firſt come into the World. Their Beings afterward increaſe; and this muſt be by a natural power, which God the great Creator hath created in them at firſt, and made every creature to be brought forth with, without which it could not grow beyond its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in the firſt day of its production into the World. This is that which the Philoſopher calls <hi>Facultatem Auctricem; the power by which the living creature grows and increaſeth to a juſt perfection and meaſure.</hi> I ſay, a juſt meaſure, for no creature groweth always. The God of Nature hath ſet a juſt meaſure to every Being: This Power alſo muſt be upheld, or the World would be full of none but Children, and very ſmall beaſts. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 104.14, <hi>He cauſeth the graſs to grow for the cattel;</hi> and by a parity of Reaſon, he muſt alſo cauſe the cattel to grow for the graſs. Chriſt hath taught us, that we cannot add <hi>one cubit to our ſtature:</hi> It is true, man and beaſt grows to both their juſt dimenſions by a <hi>natural faculty;</hi> mans growth ſtops at <hi>thirty years, or under,</hi> by a <hi>natural Law.</hi> But God at firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them this Natural faculty; and God by a daily concourſe of his Providence <hi>upholdeth, enliveneth,</hi> and <hi>aſſiſteth</hi> this <hi>natural faculty,</hi> and by this particular act of his Providence he doth preſerve and uphold both man and beaſt, as in their Beings, ſo in their juſt dimenſions and proportions in which we ſee them ſupplying and adorning the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:192227:53"/>3. But thirdly, Suppoſing all living creatures preſerv'd and upheld in their ſeveral lives and beings by Gods upholding and preſerving thoſe ſeveral powers and faculties in the object of their nouriſhment, by which they are made fit nouriſhment for their bodies: and thoſe ſeveral faculties in their bodies, which are the ſubjects to be nouriſhed, by vertue of which they deſire their due food, concoct, digeſt it, &amp;c. and to uphold the juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of creatures in the World, by preſerving and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them that faculty by which they dilate themſelves, grow, and increaſe to the law of Magnitude which the great Creator hath ſet for them: yet if they had not all a ſeveral power to propagate their <hi>ſpecies</hi> or <hi>kind,</hi> the World, or at leaſt <hi>the living creatures</hi> in the World, would quickly ceaſe; the days of mans life are three or fourſcore years, the days of moſt other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures much leſs. God hath therefore created all living things <hi>with a power to propagate their ſpecies,</hi> ſome one way, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: of all he hath, he ſaith in the day they were created, <hi>Let them increaſe and multiply:</hi> and hath created ſeveral powers and vertues in them, by which, as all <hi>ſpecies,</hi> ſo moſt individuals doth ſo. To ſome individuals of moſt kind he denieth this, or at leaſt concurreth not by his Providence to the effects of it. Some Men and Women are barren; ſo are ſome beaſts: generally not ſo: and this is another act of Divine Providence, by which he preſerveth both man and beaſt, and eminently attributed to God. The <hi>Rabbies</hi> tell us of three Keys which God keepeth: the Key <hi>of the Clouds,</hi> of <hi>the Womb,</hi> of <hi>the Grave.</hi> None can give Rain but God; none can open the Graves but God; none can open the Womb but God. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 113.9, <hi>He maketh the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren womb to keep houſe.</hi> Pſalm 127.3, <hi>Children are the heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is his reward.</hi> It is as true of other creatures as of man; <hi>He turneth a fruitful land into barrenneſs,</hi> Pſalm 107.34. It was Gods Promiſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.26, <hi>There ſhall nothing caſt her young, nor be barren in thy land.</hi> Deut. 7.14, <hi>There ſhall neither male nor female be barren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, nor amongſt your cattel.</hi> The flocks of the field and of the air, the herds of Cattel, the multitudes of Fiſh in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the numberleſs Families of the Earth, they are all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the daily concurrence of Divine Providence, in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of that natural power and vertue with which he hath created them, by which <hi>they propagate their ſpecies:</hi> by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:192227:54"/>of which, and the multiplication, and the ſucceſſion of individuals in it, <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>beaſt,</hi> the whole living World is preſerved.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>There is yet a fourth ſort of Powers and Faculties, which I called thoſe faculties, abilities, or powers, which are neceſſary to every living being, for the performance of its ſeveral operations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpecifick nature of it. God alſo preſerveth man and beast, by upholding, and preſerving theſe to their ſeveral operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> The Herb hath only a <hi>vegetative ſoul,</hi> by vertue of which it grows, buds, bloſſoms, <hi>produceth its ſeed,</hi> &amp;c. The beaſts have a <hi>ſenſitive ſoul,</hi> which works a little further: Man hath a <hi>reaſonable ſoul,</hi> comprehenſive of all the powers and vertues of the former, and extending further; he ſeeth, heareth, perceiveth things by his outward and inward ſenſes. By his Underſtanding he gains the notion of things, judgeth of them: he willeth, and chuſeth by his will, &amp;c. Now his power to all theſe, and other operations proper to his nature, muſt be preſerved and upheld, or he can do none of theſe things. Theſe powers are not indeed all neceſſary to our being, and the keeping of our ſouls in life; but the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them is neceſſary to our perfection, and the actions that are proper to the ſtations wherein we are, and the capacities in which we ſtand: God hath not only created in the Soul a power to ſee, hear, taſt, &amp;c. and created the Eye to be the Organ to the viſive Faculty, and the Ear to be the Organ to the <hi>hearing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> and the <hi>pallat</hi> to be the Organ for the faculty of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taſts: but he concurreth with his Providence both to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>faculty in the ſoul,</hi> and to keep the ſeveral Organs in tune and order, that by and through them as means, thoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might be exerciſed; and as the upholding both the faculties and Organs, or inſtruments, the bodily members, by which they are exerciſed in their due ſtate, is the cauſe why we hear, ſee, taſt, &amp;c. ſo Gods withholding that concurrence, as to ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſons, is the reaſon why ſome are deaf, blind, &amp;c. For though there be ſecond cauſes of theſe infirmities, decays and weakneſſes in humane bodies, yet all theſe are under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance of the firſt cauſe, either ſet on work by God, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in their motions by God; and this is as true alſo of the <hi>Locomotive faculty,</hi> the power in man or beaſts to move from one place to another for their food and diſpatch of buſineſs: for though it be the Soul that moveth, yet it is by vertue of a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:192227:54"/>power which God created in it to command the motion of the feet, for the moving of the whole body: and man moveth no longer, than this inward power or faculty is upheld by God; and his feet which are the Organs or inſtruments of motion, are kept in order free from diſlocation, or ruptures of joints or bones, or the incumbrances of troubleſome humours; the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which freedom dependeth upon the influence of the Divine Power; and thus, <hi>requiritur continuus tam verbi conſervatricis, quam creatricis influxus,</hi> to preſerve man and beaſt, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as well a continual influence of the upholding-word, as the influence of the creating-word to give both man and beaſt a firſt being. So as <hi>Raymundus de Sabunde</hi> ſaith truly,
<note place="margin">Ut radiorum eſſe a Sole, um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra a corpore: ita omnes crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae, a divinâ pendent conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatione.</note> 
                     <hi>All creatures depend upon the Divine Power for their preſervation, as the beams of the Sun for their being depend upon the Sun, and the ſhadow upon the body.</hi> I ſhall add no more to my Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this third Act of Providence, by which <hi>God preſerveth both man and beaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth Act by which God preſerveth both man and beaſt, is <hi>Gods diſcovering to his creatures the vertue of other creatures, with which he hath created them, for the amending, repairing, and recovering of the decays and diſorders to which their frail na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſubjected, and concurrence in the uſe and application of them: upholding the vertues in them in order to that end, and bleſſing the application of them. For the delivery of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from diſeaſes and accidents to which they are ſubjected, Meſua</hi> the great <hi>Arabian</hi> Doctor, is ſaid to have cried out,
<note place="margin">Solus Sanat languores Deus.</note> 
                     <hi>That God alone doth heal ſickneſſes and diſeaſes.</hi> God made man healthy, in the day wherein he was created, and moſt think he ſhould have continued ſo, if by his fall he had not diſordered the <hi>craſis</hi> or temperament of his bodily humours, corrupted the air, brought a curſe upon the Earth, which hath ever ſince brought forth as well <hi>bryers and thorns</hi> to prick and offend his fleſh, as <hi>herbs and fruits</hi> to increaſe and nouriſh it. Man is ſubject to a variety of <hi>diſeaſes</hi> in all parts of his body, from the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of humours, the ill affections of the air, of his food, &amp;c. The <hi>Heathens</hi> had ſome notion of this: Their Elegant Poet cries out,

                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:192227:55"/>That was their Fiction; That one <hi>Prometheus</hi> ſtole fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which <hi>Jupiter</hi> had hid up, and diſtributed it amongſt men; whence he ſaith came ſickneſs, and a whole troop of agues, and fevers, and death. Faith makes a better diſcovery: it tells us man fell from the ſtate wherein he was created, loſt the Image of God, brake Covenant with him, and ſo became ſubject to ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, unto death, &amp;c. Yea, ſo ſubject are we, that if every one that falls ſick ſhould die, men eſpecially would fail from the Earth; but to prevent this, as God in the day when he made Heaven and Earth, created divers qualities in his creatures, by which they have a ſanative or healing vertue for various Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: ſo his Providence is daily working, and daily ſeen in this thing, in two particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In diſcovering</hi> to ſome of his creatures theſe hidden vertues. The Phyſitian indeed ſtudies, and makes experiments; and upon the exerciſe of his reaſon, and the demonſtrations he makes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the Apothecary to compound Medicines; but his God <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth him to this diſcretion;</hi> and we may reaſonably ſo conclude, when we find the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah, ch.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 29, affirming it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſcretion of the Threſher, <hi>not threſhing the fitches, nor turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cart-wheel upon the Cummin;</hi> and this is a work of daily Providence; as every day produceth new Methods of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians practice, new Medicines and Compoſitions, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>In upholding the Vertues of</hi> thoſe <hi>herbs, roots,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that are made uſe of, in order to our healing, ſo as they have their effects in removing our diſtempers, and healing us.</hi> The ſtrength of the body muſt be upheld, and the faculties by which it is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to take in, and apply, and retain the Medicine: and the vertues, faculties and powers alſo of the <hi>drugs, herbs, plants, ſeeds,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be upheld alſo: both of them are by the mighty powerful concourſe and power of God: hence the Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth our <hi>healing</hi> unto God; <hi>I am the Lord that healeth you,</hi> Exod. 15.26. And the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>He healeth all our diſeaſes: I wound, and I heal,</hi> Deut. 32.39. Hence <hi>Aſa</hi> is rightly blamed for truſting in <hi>Phyſitians more than in God.</hi> Phyſicians are Gods <hi>Ordinance,</hi> they are to be uſed, but not to be truſted in. God muſt diſcover the healing-Medicine to them: God muſt uphold the healing-vertue in the Medicine when uſed by them, and the faculties alſo in their Patients, by which they muſt be inabled to take, uſe, and apply the Medicines they adminiſter And thus
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:192227:55"/>now have I ſhewed you, how God by the ordinary workings of his Providenee, every day worketh in the preſerving <hi>man and beaſt,</hi> conſider'd as Individuals.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But as in the production of things into being, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ordinary rule and law of Nature generally obſerved, there are ſome <hi>Anomalies</hi> or <hi>deviations;</hi> ſo in the preſervings of the creature, in the workings of Divine Providence, God who will not be tracked in any of his ways, maketh ſome <hi>Anomalies,</hi> turns out of his ordinary road in ſome ſpecial caſes. Ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he worketh by means natural, and to the Eye of Reaſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means: ſometimes he will do his work without means, or without ſuch apparent probable means, or, by what our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall judg, quite contrary to the end: He will walk ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a natural courſe, ſometimes contrary to it; Theſe we call <hi>Miraculous Acts of Divine Providence.</hi> The Bodies of ſome of his people ſhall be ſometimes upheld a long time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>nouriſhment,</hi> without <hi>natural Reſt,</hi> without <hi>ſenſible breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> healed without proper applications of Phyſick. Many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of which we have in the ſtory of the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles:</hi> but theſe are ertraordinary and <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial;</hi> and my buſineſs is not to diſcourſe thoſe workings of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which are unaccountable to us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, There is a <hi>ſpecial providence of God</hi> in <hi>preſerving man,</hi> that is yet further conſiderable by us. We have hitherto only conſidered the preſervation of <hi>men</hi> as <hi>Individuals,</hi> man conſidered as a ſingle perſon by himſelf. I muſt further conſider him as a <hi>political creature,</hi> involved in Society, and ſhew you the workings of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> in preſerving Bodies-Politick, and the Societies of men: and then (3dly, as a <hi>ſpiritual creature,</hi> capable of the Grace of God, and being made partaker of it.

                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:192227:56"/>The Lord who preſerveth both man and beaſt! How great, how glorious muſt the God whom we ſerve, be, if what you have heard be true? But to open this a little in a few Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It may ſatisfie you in that great truth of Gods Immenſity.</hi> The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> ſay, God filleth the Heavens and the Earth, <hi>&amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum ultra Spatium,</hi> an infinite ſpace beyond. The Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24, ſaith. <hi>Do not I the Lord fill Heaven and Earth?</hi> It muſt needs be ſo. The Heavens and the Earth are creatures, and they are all full of living creatures. So are the great and wide Seas: all theſe creatures muſt breathe, be nouriſhed, reſt, grow, and increaſe, multiply their ſpecies, be renewed daily; they have all their ſeveral and various motions and operations: for theſe, they have powers, and faculties; all theſe (as you have heard) are upheld by God by the daily concourſe and influence of his Divine Providence; he muſt heal their diſeaſes, reſtore their lapſes and decays. How could all this be, if he were not every where filling it with his Eſſence, Preſence, and Power?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> From hence you may conclude, <hi>The Activity of the Divine Eſſence.</hi> You muſt not think that the great God is in any place, as a ſtone which indeed filleth the place, but moveth not, acteth nothing; He is in the World, (ſay the <hi>Heathen</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers) as a Maſter of a ſhip, is in a ſhip, as a <hi>Moderator;</hi> as the Soul is in the Body, which is in every part of the Body, enlivening and actuating every part. God is <hi>totus actus,</hi> all Act. <hi>He worketh</hi> (ſaith our Saviour); <hi>hitherto my Father work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi> Take heed of making an Idol of God in your ſecret thoughts and apprehenſions of Him. Our fear of God, our love, our homage to him, will all be proportioned to our apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him; it is therefore of great importance for Chriſtians to have right notions and apprehenſions of God, otherwiſe they will never glorifie him as God; and needs muſt his Being be an active working Being, if (as my Text ſaith) he preſerveth <hi>man and beaſt.</hi> They in all places have need of the Activity of God every hour, every moment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This may teach you to apprehend the great God, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth deſcribe him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 113.5, 6, <hi>Who is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high: who humbleth himſelf to behold the things that are in the Heavens, and in the Earth?</hi> This
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:192227:56"/>beholding is not an idle view, and beholding of them neither, as followeth there, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>He raiſeth up the poor out of the duſt; and lifteth the needy out of the dunghil.</hi> God is not in the world as a <hi>King is in his Kingdom</hi> only. A King is a body, that muſt occupy, and take up but one ſpace; there he is, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceth his dominions by his Laws, Edicts, and the miniſtry of inferiour Magiſtrates. But this <hi>great Lord</hi> is in all places,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quis diſpoſuit membra culicis, &amp; pulicis, ut habeant ordinem ſuum, &amp; vitam ſuam? quis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſuit iſta? quis fecit iſta?</hi> Aug.</note> hath his hand in and upon every natural action.

The uſual prejudice againſt this Doctrine in our thoughts is, that it ſeems to be an employment too low for the great God, to uphold the faculties of the meaner and more diſhonourable part of his creatures: but <hi>Ambroſe</hi> anſwers it well. If it were not beneath the honour of God to make them, it is not beneath his honour to uphold and preſerve them; in the mean time how doth God humble himſelf in theſe his acts of Providence? Who is like unto our God, who humbleth himſelf thus to behold, and look upon; to care for, and look to the meaneſt of his creatures?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But this Doctrine <hi>ſhews us God admirable in nothing more than in his patience and long-ſuffering.</hi> Hath any of us an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to our meat and drink, a power to digeſt and concoct it, it is the Lord that gives it: have we a power to move our tongue to ſpeak, our feet to walk, our body to any natural actions? all this is from the Lord, who is wonderful in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Oh how patient is God with the drunkard, with the liar, the profane ſwearer, with all ſorts of ſinners, who uſe their bodies, or the ſeveral members and parts of them, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning, abuſing, blaſpheming of his holy name; or in doing, or in order to the doing of any actions in the violation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his holy and righteous Laws. Why do they go on deſpiſing <hi>the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth them to repentance? but after the hardneſs and impenitency of their hearts treaſure up unto themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God. Who will render unto every man according to his deeds,</hi> Rom. 2.3, 4, 5. Yea, and <hi>the Lord is not ſlack, as ſome men count ſlackneſs, but is long-ſuffering
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:192227:57"/>to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.10. Thus far this Doctrine may inſtruct you concerning God.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For the defaming of all ſin,</hi> and diſobedience to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For the promoving of piety, indeed in all the parts of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt. How ſhould this <hi>defame ſin</hi> to every ingenuous ſoul, and that two ways. 1. <hi>As it ſheweth it to be a moſt audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous daring of a juſt and holy God.</hi> I remember a paſſage God uſeth to his ancient people the <hi>Jews,</hi> Hoſ. 2.9, <hi>She did not know that I gave her her corn, wine and oyl, which ſhe prepared for Baal; therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedneſs;</hi> and I will diſcover <hi>her lewdneſs in the ſight of her lovers.</hi> Doth the man who uſeth his tongue to lying, curſing, ſwearing, blaſpheming, reviling, know that it is God that upholdeth that faculty by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:192227:57"/>which he ſpeaketh? Doth the glutton and the drunkard know that it is God that gives him an appetite, a power of concoction, and digeſtion, attraction, &amp;c. Doth the ſinner know, that it is God who giveth him air to ſuck in, and a power to ſuck it in? doth he know that it is God who hath given him that hand, and a power to move that hand, which from the malice of his heart he ſtretcheth out to work iniquity? Oh! what a daring of an holy and righteous God muſt all ſinning with our bodily members be! Methinks the bold and daring ſinner ſhould think with himſelf theſe two things. 1. <hi>That he who gave him theſe natural powers, can alſo at pleaſure take them away.</hi> 2. That he can do it with the greateſt eaſe imaginable. It is but the withdrawing of this hand of Providence from us, our natural powers fail; our faculties are all loſt. When a man is uſing his tongue to lye to his neighbour, to curſe him, to ſwear profanely, and to blaſpheme God; methinks he ſhould thus think with himſelf, How eaſily can God ſtop my breath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw that hand from my tongue which upholds my faculty to ſpeak. Methinks he ſhould remember the inſtance of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> the father of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> but for a few words of unbelief. When a man is ſtretching out his hand to work any iniquity, methinks he ſhould remember how eaſily God could do by him, as by <hi>Jeroboam, When he ſtretched out his hand to lay hold of the Prophet,</hi> and his hand preſently withered. If any of you lent your hand to one that were blind, or lame, and he ſhould ſpit in your face, revile you, &amp;c. would not you think it a ſtrange daring of you? Oh! what a daring of an holy, juſt, and powerful God it is for a man wilfully and preſumptuouſly to uſe a member of his body, or a power, or faculty of his Soul, knowingly, and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ſin againſt God? Thus this Doctrine may ſerve to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame ſin to every ingenuous ſoul, as it neceſſarily muſt be an impudent daring of a juſt and holy God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it defameth it further, <hi>As it ſpeaketh it an act of the higheſt ingratitude imaginable.</hi> Ingratitude ſoundeth ill, very ill in the ears of humane nature; ſo ill, that an Heathen could ſay of it, <hi>Call a man an ingrateful man, and you call him all that is naught:</hi> it is a very great vice. Every ſinner muſt ſay, If God had not been ſo good to me, I had not been ſo evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The Drunkard muſt ſay, If God had not aſſiſted
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:192227:58"/>me to my natural action in drinking, I could not have diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him by that exceſs. The like muſt every ſinner ſay, the lyar, the ſwearer, the adulterer. God hath nothing to do with the obliquity of their action; but to the action ſo far forth as natural, his Providence aſſiſteth, upholding the natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to their natural Operations. <hi>And do you thus requite the Lord,</hi> O fooliſh people? Is this your thankfulneſs to God for Gods aſſiſtance of you in the uſe of your faculties, for the neceſſary uſes of your life? I gave thee cloth, ſaith God, to cover thy nakedneſs, thou makeſt it to ſerve thy pride; my creatures to ſilence thy natural paſſions of hunger, and thirſt, and thou uſeſt it to ſerve thy Luxury. I gave thee a tongue to interpret thy mind to thy neighbour, and to praiſe me, and I aſſiſt thee in the natural uſe of it: thou uſeſt it to ſwear, curſe, to blaſpheme my great and ſacred name. I gave thee an hand, and aſſiſt thee in the uſe of it, that thou mayeſt get bread, and do the works of thy calling in order thereunto: thou uſeſt it to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs, to perſecute and oppreſs my people. Thus the ſinner turneth the gifts of God into weapons with which he fighteth againſt him. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a quite contrary reſolution in holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 116, <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>take the cup, of ſalvation, and praiſe the Lord.</hi> I know, that <hi>Poculum ſalutis</hi> is capable of other interpretations, which are alſo given according to the various fancies of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters. But why may not we interpret it thus? <hi>I will take that very mercy which, thou haſt ſhewed me,</hi> and uſe it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it for thy honour and glory. Certainly thus we ought to do as <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 Sam. 1. did by her child <hi>Samuel,</hi> which ſhe had begged and received of God. She takes her child, and at the return of the year carrieth him up to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>For this child I prayed, and the Lord heard me; hath given me my Petition which I asked of him: Therefore alſo I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he ſhall be lent unto the Lord.</hi> But of this more under the next head; to which I now come, to ſhew you how far what you have heard may be uſeful. 2. <hi>To promove piety,</hi> and that both in the internal and external acts of it, in the more immediate acts of homage, which we are to pay to God, and in all the duties of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pious converſation before men, in obedience to the will of God. It is not hard to underſtand upon this <hi>hypotheſis,</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:192227:58"/>that God doth thus concur in the aſſiſtance of all our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculties, in order to the preſerving of us, how reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is, that we ſhould be <hi>in the fear of the Lord all the day long;</hi> That we ſhould live in an exerciſe of faith, truſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency upon him; That we ſhould love the Lord at all times. And for acts of more external immediate homage, <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>praiſe,</hi> &amp;c. How reaſonable a thing is <hi>prayer</hi> morning and evening; doeſt thou not remember it is God that muſt concur to give thee ſleep in the night, a power to breath, to move, to work, to eat, to drink, &amp;c. and give me leave to tell you, if you do not think the ſleep of the night, or a ſtrength to labour in the day, an appetite to thy meat, a power to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it, a liberty and power to breath, mercies worth the asking; it is becauſe thou haſt not wanted them much: will you not every day have need of the uſe of your ſenſes, your hands, your tongue, your feet, your ears, &amp;c? do not you think them mercies worth the asking? Go to the lame, and the blind, and the deaf, and thoſe that lye on ſick-beds, and enquire of them; they will better inſtruct you in the value of theſe things. Do not you know what to pray for ſo often? this Doctrine will ſhew you in part; pray that God would preſerve your life and being, uphold your powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp;c. And <hi>Praiſe</hi> is as reaſonable as Prayer; you are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day fearfully and wonderfully preſerved. By whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is it, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James</hi> ſaid to the people when they had cured the lame man? <hi>Not by our</hi> power, but by the <hi>power of Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> doth this man walk. So give me leave to tell you, it is not by your own power, nor by the meer ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of your own faculties, with which you are born, that you ſleep, walk, diſcourſe, work, but by the mighty power of God concurring and aſſiſting thoſe faculties. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you may hence conclude the reaſonableneſs of that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cuſtom, (which ſome have bruitiſhly caſt off) begging a bleſſing upon your meat at meals, and giving thanks after receit of it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Certainly this Meditation well digeſted, cannot but highly promove <hi>all manner of practical holineſs.</hi> For what is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but the obedience of the members of our bodies and powers, and faculties of our Souls to the Will of God, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of them all according to the Divine Rule, and the end for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:192227:59"/>which he gave them to us; and what can be more perſwaſive to this, than for us to hear, that as God hath given theſe powers, ſo God upholdeth them in exerciſe; in him we live, by him eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member we have moves, and we are all kept in being: may I not therefore with the Apoſtle conclude, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1, <hi>I beſeech you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, that you preſent your bodies as a living ſacrifice, holy acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice.</hi> It is reaſonable that he who hath given you the Sacrifice, ſhould ſmell the ſweet ſavour of it. He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the ſacrifice for you; He hath provided it for that end, to be a ſacrifice for him; it is therefore but a <hi>reaſonable Service.</hi> It is reaſonable that he who <hi>planteth a Vineyard,</hi> who <hi>dreſſeth, keepeth,</hi> and <hi>preſerveth it every day,</hi> ſhould have ſome of the fruit thereof. Which <hi>of you planteth a Vineyard,</hi> and <hi>Orchard,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>eateth not of the fruit thereof?</hi> But I ſhall add no more to this firſt part of my Diſcourſe, concerning Gods preſerving <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>

                  <p>I AM diſcourſing concerning the firſt mentioned great Act of Providence, in the <hi>Preſervation</hi> both of man and beaſt, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholding all things by the word of his power.</hi> I ſhewed you in my laſt Diſcourſe, by what particular acts, God preſerveth <hi>individuals</hi> of all kinds. But <hi>Man,</hi> is to be conſidered yet in two notions further: Man is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a ſociable, a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical creature; and ſo as one of a multitude, formed into po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical bodies, called by the names of <hi>Kingdoms, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,</hi> &amp;c. He is further to be conſidered, as a <hi>ſpiritual crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> capable of Divine Grace, and divers ſpiritual Habits, things which <hi>accompany ſalvation,</hi> and make him <hi>fit for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> and preparing him for that bleſſed Eternity, which is the end of our hopes. Theſe alſo muſt be upheld, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the power of Providence; <hi>We are</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>kept by the power of God through faith to ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. My laſt Diſcourſe ſhewed you no more than the particular work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Divine Providence, in preſerving and upholding the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural world.</hi> Let me now ſhew you the workings of it, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and upholding the <hi>Political,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> World. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the former, and ſo the preſerving Providence of God worketh ſeveral ways. 1. <hi>In diſpoſing the minds of all people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Government.</hi> There are indeed ſome Anomalies here, ſome ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> in all places, that will endure no yoke, but generally it is not ſo. And the minds of men are diſpoſed to order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:192227:60"/>without Government Polities could not ſtand, the World would quickly be in confuſion; there can be no order without <hi>Governours,</hi> and governed. Governours muſt be ſpirited for the exerciſe of Government, and the Governed muſt be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for <hi>obedience.</hi> Both theſe are from the Lord, who is <hi>wonderful in working.</hi> Every one is not fit to govern; he hath not parts for it, he hath not a ſpirit for it. Some are like <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> fit for nothing but to <hi>couch under the burthen.</hi> Others like <hi>Judah,</hi> who have hands fit to be <hi>upon the necks of their Enemies, and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers children ſhall bow down before them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. God by his Providence <hi>influenceth ſome for the exerciſe of Government,</hi> either from the womb, or from the time they are called to that exerciſe, as it is ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.9, when <hi>Samuel</hi> had anointed him to be King over <hi>Iſrael, God gave him another heart.</hi> Every man hath not a ſpirit of Government; there is much goeth to the making up of that ſpirit. It was prophecied of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, That <hi>the Government ſhould be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his ſhoulders.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2, <hi>The Spirit ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſdom, and underſtanding, the ſpirit of counſel, and might, the ſpirit of knowledg, and fear of the Lord.</hi> A ſpirit of knowledg, and of the fear of the Lord is neceſſary to a religious Government. A ſpirit of underſtanding and wiſdom; a <hi>ſpirit of counſel, and might,</hi> is neceſſary for a good <hi>civil Government. Joſhua</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun,</hi> was full of <hi>the ſpirit of wiſdom,</hi> Deut. 34 9. Every man in a Kingdom, or a City, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, hath not knowledg, and underſtanding, nor wiſdom, and counſel, nor might, and courage fit for Government: God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it only to ſome perſons, whom he deſigneth to rule over men. And herein is the Providence of God mightily ſeen, and that both in Hereditary Kingdoms and States, and in thoſe alſo which are Elective: 1. In <hi>ſuch as are hereditary:</hi> ordinarily the ſons of Princes are not like other men, though under equal cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Education. When <hi>Gideon</hi> asked <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munna,</hi> Judg. 8.18, <hi>What manner of men they were that they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</hi> They anſwered him thus, <hi>As thou art, ſo were they; each one reſembled the children of a King:</hi> There is ſomething that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily appears in the faces of Princes, more of <hi>Majeſty</hi> than in other men, which ſhews another ſpirit. I know that this is not univerſal; there have been Princes in the World of mean parts, courage, &amp;c. which ordinarily happens when God hath a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:192227:60"/>quarrel with a people, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.16, 17, <hi>Wo to thee, O Land, when thy King is a child, and thy Princes eat in the morning: Bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the ſon of Nobles, and thy Princes eat in due ſeaſon, for ſtrength, and not for drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> 2. It is much ſeen in <hi>Elective governments.</hi> God by his Providence directeth, and diſpoſeth the Electors to the choice of ſuch perſons as he hath prepared with ſuch a ſpirit; or (except in caſes where God hath a deſign by unworthy Governours to chaſtiſe a ſinful people) when they are choſen, he giveth unto them ſuch a ſpirit, and by his extraordinary Providence correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the errours of thoſe that chooſe them to that employment. This is a wonderful working of Divine Providence. We often ſee perſons in Government, ſhewing quite another ſpirit and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than they before appear'd to us to have. Nor is the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God leſs ſeen in diſpoſing the ſpirits of the <hi>Governed;</hi> That thouſands, yea millions of people ſhould conſent to a ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to one chief Ruler (as in a Monarchy) or to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a few (as in Commonwealths), and be willing to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and governed by him, or them: yet this we ordinarily ſee. It is the Lords doing, and it ſhould be marvellous in our eyes: and it would be ſo, if we would but be ſo conſiderate as to think of the variety of mens humours, fancies and paſſions. Sometimes indeed God in judgment againſt a people, ſuffers a perverſe ſpirit to mingle it ſelf with the governed; there are rebellions, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies, yet thoſe for the moſt part are originated in oppreſſion and violence. But ſuppoſing no errours in Governours, that yet multitudes of people ſhould be ſo willingly ſubject (and yet few of them for conſcience ſake) muſt needs come from the Lords influence, who is wonderful in the working for the preſerving of the Politick Societies of men, which without a Political order or Government could not ſtand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> God <hi>preſerveth</hi> men in their <hi>Political Societies, by directing them to make, and to agree in Laws proper for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; as to this he upholdeth the reaſon of Legiſlators.</hi> Laws are the rules of Government. 1. <hi>God hath given unto men a Divine Law</hi> for a Copy; the Book of this, the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was always to have before him, and he was to read in it all the days of his life, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 1.8. The Divine Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns ſome generals; but there muſt be many particular Laws, reſpecting the complexions of ſeveral Kingdoms and bodies of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:192227:61"/>people: In the making of which the <hi>Providence of God,</hi> and his influence is wonderfully ſeen, upholding the reaſon of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers to the making of ſuch Laws as are neceſſary and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and proper for the government of ſuch a people. It is true, as the <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> were wont to ſay, <hi>That the Spirit of God did not always touch the hearts of the Prophets;</hi> ſo neither <hi>doth the Spirit of God always touch and direct the hearts of Legiſlators.</hi> God ſuffereth ſometimes the wiſdom of the wiſe to fail them: impious and wicked Laws, fooliſh and inſignificant Laws may ſometimes be made, to which it were blaſphemy to intitle God in any efficient cauſation. God will by theſe inſtances let us ſee men are but men; but yet there is ſuch an ordinary influence of Divine Providence, that although ſome Kingdoms and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths in a Superfoetation of Laws may have ſome wicked and impious, others fooliſh and inſignificant; yet they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in ſuch as are neceſſary to maintain Juſtice, and preſerve civil order and peace. Now although we muſt by no means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title God to the wicked effects of men (which he only permits), nor to the follies and impertinencies of men: yet he is juſtly to be entitled to the wiſe and prudent effects of his creatures; for good uſeful and neceſſary Laws they are from the Lord, who is wiſe in counſel, from whom cometh every good and perfect gift. If the Plowman be inſtructed by God with diſcretion, and taught, and the <hi>Threſher</hi> be inſtructed, as to the diſcretion he uſeth, by <hi>the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> who is <hi>wonderful in counſel, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in working</hi> (which the Prophet aſſerteth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.) Then certainly the hearts of thoſe who are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the making of Rules for the Government of the great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his people, are inſtructed alſo from the Lord, who is great in Wiſdom, and wonderful in Counſel. And herein is the mighty Power and Wiſdom of God ſeen, in the preſervation of Political Societies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third thing wherein the Providence of God is ſeen in the preſerving of theſe Societies, is, <hi>In the ordinary ſilencing of thoſe paſſions in men, which diſorder and diſturb all Government.</hi> We juſtly look upon it as a merciful piece of Divine Providence, to conceal from ſome beaſts of great uſe in our lives their own ſtrength, which if known to them, would make them our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The multitude in any Polity is as an unruly beaſt, and all Governments are preſerved by their ignorance of their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:192227:61"/>own ſtrength, and the bridle of Divine Providence, by which God keeps them in and ſilenceth their paſſions, which if let looſe, would quickly turn all into a tumult and confuſion. The Individuals of all Societies are full of boiſterous and brutiſh paſſions; ſo as a conſiderate man when he looketh upon ſuch a City as this, or any other great Political Body, and conſidereth how many perſons are in it of unruly tempers and paſſions, who either know not the rules of natural Juſtice and Equity; or if they know any thing of them, their luſts and paſſions will not ſuffer them to live in any juſt obſervance of them; will ſee reaſon to wonder how people of ſuch heterogeneous tempers and different paſſions, ſhould ever live together a year, or a month, in peace and any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of order: nor is there any thing which holds them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the wonderful influence of Divine Providence, ſilencing their paſſions, and reſtraining thoſe luſts in men, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would ſet any Kingdom, City or Nation on a fire, and bring it quickly to an heap of rubbiſh and confuſion. It was ſaid of old, that in the degenerate ſtate of man, <hi>Homo homini lupus,</hi> one man is a Wolf to another, and nothing but the Divine Hand keeps them from biting and devouring each other; the Lord by his <hi>Providence</hi> holds them in as the <hi>Horſe</hi> and the <hi>Mule</hi> with <hi>bit and bridle.</hi> When God thinks fit for the puniſhment of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Nations but a little to let looſe the Reins, we ſee what brutiſh paſſions do diſcover themſelves in men; what <hi>envy, malice, revenge, oppreſſion,</hi> and other luſts and vices directly tending to deſtroy Societies. So as we are only preſerved becauſe theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders are but fits of diſtemper, not abiding diſeaſes in the bodies of people; and the reaſon why they are no more is from Gods reſtraining influence upon unruly turbulent ſpirits: <hi>He that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the raging of the Sea, and ſtilleth the waves thereof when they ariſe,</hi> ruleth alſo the paſſions of men, keeps them generally ſtill, and ſtilleth them if at any time they riſe to any exorbitant heighth: 'tis the ſame power that doth them both: <hi>Pſalm</hi> 65.7, <hi>Thou ſtilleſt the noiſe of the Sea, the noiſe of its waves, and the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults of the people.</hi> It is God that ſaith, <hi>Be ſtill, O ye inhabitants of the Iſlands:</hi> Whence is it but from this, that there are ſo few <hi>murthers, rapes,</hi> &amp;c. no more <hi>thefts</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Violence?</hi> We ſee the fear of puniſhment will not reſtrain them, as ſoon as God but takes off his reſtraint from them; and the conſideration how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable multitudes appear in their fits of diſorder, is enough
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:192227:62"/>to convince men, that the general tie of people have not reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be a law unto themſelves, but are meerly governed and over-ruled by the <hi>influence</hi> of Gods reſtraint upon them, for the preſervation of his people in their political Societies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth thing wherein the power of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſeen in the <hi>preſervation of Men,</hi> in their <hi>Political Societies, is in diſcovering the ſecret devices, and conſpiracies of men, tending to the diſturbance and diſſolution of Government</hi> in the places where they live: I ſtill underſtand this in <hi>ordinary cauſes.</hi> When God hath a deſign to puniſh a <hi>Senacherib,</hi> he ſuffers the plottings of his own ſons to take effect againſt him. God ſometimes puniſheth <hi>Rulers:</hi> ſometimes he puniſheth People by ſuch ſufferances, but ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he doth not. You have an hundred Treaſons diſcovered, for one that takes effect. Here I might enlarge ſtrangely, how God brings to light thoſe hidden works of darkneſs, wherein the welfare of States and Kingdoms are concerned. <hi>Solomon</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gives good counſel, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.20, <hi>Curſe not the King in thy thoughts, nor the rich</hi> (that is, the Ruler I conceive) <hi>in thy Bed-chamber: for a bird of the air ſhall carry the voice, and that which hath wings ſhall tell the matter;</hi> that is, it ſhall be diſcovered <hi>ſtrangely</hi> and <hi>ſwiftly.</hi> What eminent inſtances of Divine Providence of this nature we had in our own Nation, eſpecially in the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the beginning of King <hi>James</hi> his reign.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes <hi>God ſetteth their own Conſciences on work, and they ſhall betray and diſcover themſelves;</hi> before they fall to their work, God ſmiteth one of their Conſciences, and they come and diſcover their Complices and confeſs their own errours: how often have we had this in our own ſtory? 2. Sometimes their <hi>Countenances ſhall betray them,</hi> while they are juſt ready to ſtrike the fatal ſtroke. 3. Sometimes <hi>a terror ſhall ſeize</hi> them, and their Daggers ſhall drop out of their hands. 4. Sometimes their <hi>own Letters</hi> ſhall deſtroy them (of which we had an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent inſtance in the <hi>Powder-Treaſon,</hi> hatched by Papiſts in this Nation); ſometimes the powder ſhall not take fire: another time it ſhall miſs the mark. The Monſters are ſometimes brought to the birth, and the parents of them want a ſtrength to bring forth. How often was Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in this Nation ſo preſerved to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the word of the Lord? <hi>Job</hi> 5.12, <hi>He diſappointeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot perform their enterpriſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fifth thing I ſhall inſtance in, is <hi>Gods defeatings of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:192227:62"/>counſels</hi> of <hi>Ahitophels.</hi> All men are not alike in wiſdom and counſel: God fitteth ſome more eminently, who are to have ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the publick Government and Councils of a Nation. Amongſt theſe, ſome are men of integrity and ſincerity, men of publick ſpirits and deſigns, who uſe all their wits, parts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for the general good and proſperity of people. Others are men of more private ſpirits, driving ſelfiſh deſigns; and theſe oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are men of great craft and ſubtilty, whoſe counſels yet, ſhould they take effect, would ruin the body politick, which they pretend to ſerve, whiles they ſerve but their own bellies, or families, or the luſts of ſome others in order to that end. Here now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God is often ſeen, in <hi>defeating their counſels,</hi> and that various ways: Sometimes by making them <hi>unacceptable,</hi> as was in the caſe of <hi>Ahitophel:</hi> his counſels ordinarily, were taken and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as Oracles; but God makes the counſel of <hi>Huſhai,</hi> though (as appeareth by the ſtory, a friend at firſt ſuſpected by <hi>Abſolom</hi>) to be more accepted. Sometime God doth it by ſome more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ways, as in the caſe of <hi>Haman,</hi> who had both given coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and obtained a decree againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> The King ſhall not ſleep, but ſpend his waking times, reading the book of the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles; there he ſhall fall upon the place where a record is of the good ſervice <hi>Mordecai</hi> had done. The King ſhall miſtake <hi>Haman</hi>'s Courtſhip to the Queen, while he is making ſuit to the Queen for his life, for an attempt to force her: Thus <hi>Haman</hi> ſhall be defeated in his deſigns, and it ſhall be his own lot to be hanged upon the Gallows which he had prepared for <hi>Mordecay:</hi> nor are theſe the only inſtances. There is no Kingdom, no Age, in which obſerving perſons will not obſerve ſome inſtance or other of this nature, for the preſervation of the Political ſocieties of men.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The power of divine Providence in preſerving Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſocieties, is eminently ſeen in ballancing and diverting oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite powers.</hi> It is wonderful to obſerve how God ballanceth one Nation againſt another; ſometimes by <hi>natural ſcituation,</hi> ſometimes by <hi>voluntary aſſociations.</hi> We in <hi>England</hi> are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the former. All the Kingdoms about us are larger and more mighty than we are; <hi>France, Spain,</hi> &amp;c. far more populous. God hath ballanced us with them by our ſcituation. We are an <hi>Iſland,</hi> we are powerful in Shipping, they cannot march an army by land againſt us: that keeps us at ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with them, and from being a prey to them, often ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:192227:63"/>for us. Others God hath ſcituated in Countries full of Rocks, and Mountains, and Waters; by which natural For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications they are ballanced with the far greater fleſhly power of their Enemies. Thus God preſerved his people in <hi>Epirus</hi> from the overflowing flood of the Turkiſh Power: In <hi>Holland,</hi> from the attempts of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> 40 years together, a Nation far more great and mighty than they. Thus he hath preſerved his Church, his little flock in the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Lucerne.</hi> As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, becauſe the <hi>Conies are a feeble people, they have their habitation in the Rocks:</hi> So where God hath had a little people, a feeble people, his Providence hath for their habitation allowed them the natural defences of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and the inacceſſible paths of Rocks. Others he ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth with the far greater power of their adverſaries, by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary confederacies and conſociations: were they ſingly to be encountred, they would quickly be ſwallowed up; but they join in league with others, and ſo make a proportion to their Potent Adverſaries. Some he ballanceth by giving them a more extraordinary ſtrength, ſpirit, courage; that one will chaſe ten, and ten an hundred, and an hundred a thouſand, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſhall put ten thouſand of their Enemies in flight. Some are ſtronger in Land-forces, but weak as to Naval-forces; others ſtrong in Naval-forces, but weaker in Land-forces: till the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of a Nation comes (for Nations have their periods) he ballanceth all Political Societies one way or other, according to the variety of his infinite wiſdom. 2. Another way is by <hi>Diverſion;</hi> you have many inſtances of this in Scripture. How often hath God thus preſerved us in <hi>Europe,</hi> from the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing flood of the <hi>Turks,</hi> by ſtirring up the <hi>Perſians</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade him, by ſuffering rebellions amongſt tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e that are his own Subjects. But I ſhall contract this diſcourſe, much will fall into my following diſcourſe of Governing Providence.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The laſt thing which I ſhall inſtance in, wherein the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God is ſeen in the preſerving of men in their Political So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, is, <hi>in giving unto men wiſdom, and diſpoſing of them to ſeveral Arts, Trades, Myſteries, and Occupations, by which they become mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſerviceable one to another, and contribute to the upholding the ſocieties in which they live.</hi> Here are two things, in both which, the Providence of God is eminent to every eye which wiſtly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it. There is nothing more evident than that there is a variety
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:192227:63"/>of Arts, Myſteries, Trades, and Occupations uſeful for man, by ſome of which he is ſupplied with things neceſſary for food and rayment; by others of them, with things for delight and ornament: both the one and the other, if not neceſſary for individuals, yet are neceſſary for preſerving a Polity conſiſting of multitudes.</p>
                  <p>Now, 1. <hi>The wiſdom, by which men work in theſe ſeveral Arts, Myſteries, and Occupations, and by which men follow theſe ſeveral Trades, is from the Lord.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells us, the diſcretion of the Plow-man, and of the Threſher is from him. <hi>God called by name</hi> Bezaliel, <hi>the Son of</hi> Uri, <hi>and he was filled with the Spirit of God, in wiſdom, and in underſtanding, and in knowledg, and in all manner of workmanſhip: and to deviſe curious works, to work in gold, in ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and in braſs: And in cutting of ſtones, to ſet them, and in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work,</hi> Exod. 35.31, 32, 33, 34. and it is ſaid, that God filled him and <hi>Aholiab with wiſdom of heart to work all manner of work of the engraver, and of the cunning workman; and of the embroiderer, in blue, purple, and in ſcarlet, and in fine linnen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and deviſe any cunning work,</hi> v. 35.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Providence of God in this thing is eminently diſcerned, in <hi>diſpoſing men to theſe ſeveral employments.</hi> So that as in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body, there are ſeveral members, and every member is inclined, and naturally diſpoſed to its particular office; by which the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſes and neceſſities of the body-natural are ſupplied. So in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies politick, as there is a great variety of members, ſo the ſeveral members of it are, by the wiſe Providence of God, diſpoſed and inclined to the learning and practice of ſeveral Arts and Sciences, Trades and Occupations; by which, the uſes of the whole are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, as well as the ſeveral individuals in the Society enabled to get themſelves a ſubſiſtence, yet in the ſervice of the publick: This is a great piece of Divine Providence. One man is diſpoſed to huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry; unleſs ſome were ſo diſpoſed, however ſlaviſh and dirty the employment be, the Nation could not be fed: others to the making of Cloaths, and Stuffs, and Linnens; if none were ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, though the whole might be fed, they could not be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. One works in iron and braſs for more neceſſary uſes; another in gold and ſilver for Ornaments, and more fine and delicate uſes. One man is diſpoſed to ſtudy Phyſick, Law, Divinity, and cannot endure hard labour: another is of a more ſlaviſh and ſervile diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, no ways diſpoſed to learning and ſtudies: All this is from
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:192227:64"/>the Lord, and by this working of his Providence, the uſes of all are ſupplied, and ſo <hi>Political</hi> Societies are by this means preſerved. We have now conſidered man, 1. In his ſingle and individual ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: And. 2. In his <hi>Social</hi> and <hi>Political capacity;</hi> and ſhewn you ſeveral acts of Divine Providence, by which God, in either, preſerveth him. But we have yet a third capacity to conſider him in, that is, his <hi>ſpiritual capacity,</hi> as a creature poſſeſſed of the <hi>grace of God,</hi> the Grace of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and the Grace of <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> As to this he is in a peculiar ſenſe <hi>Gods creature,</hi> often, by Saint <hi>John,</hi> ſaid to <hi>be born of God:</hi> and as to this likewiſe he is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by God,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5, <hi>You are kept by the power of God, through faith to ſalvation.</hi> Indeed, a diſcourſe upon this properly belongs to the <hi>ſpecialties of Providence,</hi> of which, I may poſſibly hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeak diſtinctly; but not knowing whether I ſhall reach to that, ſomething (though more ſhortly and generally) I ſhall ſpeak to it here. Grace in the Soul of a man, or woman, is a noble creature, and one of thoſe things that are upheld by the mighty power of God. Now that which I have to do is to conſider, <hi>How the Providence of God worketh in upholding this noble creature in thoſe individual ſouls,</hi> into which he hath breathed this breath of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life. Let me ſhew you this in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God preſerveth man in his ſpiritual life and capacity, <hi>by a daily repeating to him his gracious acts, in the pardon of ſin, and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of Chriſts righteouſneſs to him.</hi> It hath been a Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Arminians, Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts, Whether there can be an interciſion of the ſtate of Juſtification?</hi> Whether a ſoul once juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied can again be not juſtified? We ſay No. <hi>The gifts and callings of God are without repentance; whom he loveth he loveth to the end:</hi> Well, but how can this be? <hi>for who liveth and ſinneth not? The righteous falleth ſeven times in a day.</hi> If Juſtification be not repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how can a ſoul be juſtified? We ſay, Though the <hi>ſtate</hi> abide, yet Gods gracious acts are repeated. Sin <hi>is not pardoned before it is committed;</hi> but when commited, it is pardoned by a repetition of an act of Grace. Juſtification ſpeaks a ſtate; this is not repeated: but <hi>remiſſion of ſin,</hi> is an act of Grace frequently repeated; and <hi>the imputing of Chriſts righteouſneſs</hi> is an act often repeated. We are not daily created or born, as to our natural life, but we are daily preſerved: ſo God puts the believer once into a <hi>ſtate of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> that abides and faileth not; but we ſhould fall from it every day, did not God continue us in it, by the repetition of theſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:192227:64"/>gracious acts. We need a continual pardoning, a continual impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, to preſerve our ſpiritual life, as we need continual acts of Providence to preſerve and to uphold our ſouls in their natural life. Thus every day <hi>it is God that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God preſerveth <hi>his Church</hi> and <hi>particular ſouls,</hi> as to their ſpiritual life, by a daily <hi>infuſion of thoſe habits of grace, which are neceſſary in thoſe ſouls that are ordained unto life, as the principles of thoſe operations by which they muſt attain this life, and by increaſing theſe habits in them.</hi> In a word, by perfecting, 1. <hi>The number of his Saints.</hi> 2. <hi>By perfecting their graces.</hi> The firſt reſpecteth the collective body of his Church, and is called in Scripture, <hi>an adding to the Church ſuch as ſhall be ſaved; a working of faith in all them that are ordained unto eternal ſalvation:</hi> without this the Church of God muſt periſh, and fail from the earth in a ſhort time. Gods people are mortal, even as others. Now God ſo ordereth it in his Providence, that there is a ſucceſſion. One generation of believers paſſeth, another cometh; and thus God hath a ſeed kept alive in the Earth. 2. God alſo doth it as to individuals, by a daily <hi>infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of gracious habits,</hi> further ſtrengthening and quickening them to their ſpiritual operations, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13, <hi>I can do all things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me:</hi> believers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16, <hi>are ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit.</hi> God upholdeth his own ſeed in the ſoul, and bloweth up the ſparks which himſelf hath kindled.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Gods Providence in the preſervation of men in their ſpiritual capacity, is ſeen, in the upholding and maintaining his word and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, upon which the ſouls of his people live.</hi> As the body liveth by bread, as to its natural capacity; ſo the ſoul liveth by the word of God, as to its ſpiritual capacity. <hi>By theſe things men live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hezekiah).</hi> I know ſome interpret that paſſage concerning <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:</hi> but others concerning the <hi>promiſes.</hi> Now the Providence of God hath been, and is eminently ſeen, in maintaining of his word; the written word, the word preached; in taking care that his people have had a ſucceſſion of Miniſters. Before the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> were written, God provided for the ſouls of his people by a word not written: ſince, by a written word, and that moſt eminently, ſince the whole Scripture was written, ſince which time <hi>Prophecy;</hi> and unwritten <hi>Revelations</hi> are much ceaſed, not further to be expected. God may yet reveal himſelf to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:192227:65"/>ſervants of his: but we are not to expect ſuch Revelations, nor are they the object of faith. Now herein hath the ſtupendous Providence of God been eminently ſeen; that when ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand books wrote ſince the Scriptures were written, are loſt, and there is no memorial almoſt of them; and the Scriptures have had more enemies than any of them, more that have endeavoured to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them, and to deſtroy them; yet God hath preſerved this ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of ſpiritual food, and kept it from corruption by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary care of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; the multiplying of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, guiding and governing of thoſe who have been employed in them: Nor hath the Providence of God been leſs ſeen in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters and Teachers of his word. In the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, when the ordinary officers failed, and were corrupted, God from time to time raiſed them up Prophets, who were his extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Embaſſadors to teach his people. In Chriſts time, he calls Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the Apoſtleſhip: and in all ſucceeding Ages, though there have been ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer able, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters; yet God hath ſo ordered, that there never have wanted ſome, and a competent number to break the bread of life, and to feed his people with wiſdom, and with ſpiritual underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. No ſort of men have been more maligned, hated, perſecuted, yet God hath upheld the order, and taken care for the ſouls of his people, that they have continually had faithful ſtewards of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Providence of God is admirable in preſerving man in his ſpiritual capacity, in the daily <hi>influence of his ſpirit attending his word,</hi> and <hi>ſanctifying his inſtitutions.</hi> The word is in it ſelf but a dead letter; the Preaching of the word is far from a mean ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to ſo great an effect as is the converſion and edification of ſouls: God is therefore pleaſed to join his quickening ſpirit to the word, where he pleaſeth, bleſſing and ſanctifying it. I am not of their judgment, who think that there is ſuch a conſtant concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and influence of the Spirit with the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that if men will do what in them lies, they may repent, believe, &amp;c. I know no Scripture which will juſtifie that notion; but certain it is, that the holy Spirit doth ordinarily join it ſelf with the preaching of the word, like the wind blowing where it pleaſeth, and none knoweth the motion of it, convincing men <hi>of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, The Providence of God preſerveth men in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:192227:65"/>capacities, <hi>by ſupplying them with ſtrength and ſuccour againſt their ſpiritual enemies;</hi> their own fleſh, the world, the Devil; all which with a variety of temptations ſtrike at our ſpiritual wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. But this is much of kin to what I ſaid before. I ſhall add no more to this diſcourſe concerning Gods Act of Providence, as in the preſervation of beaſts, ſo of men, and that in their ſingle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural capacities; In their Social and Political capacities, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Spiritual capacities. I ſhall only add ſome few words of application.</p>
                  <p>This in the firſt place may inform us, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> 
                     <hi>How great that God muſt neceſſarily be whom we ſerve;</hi> he is the Creator of the ends of the Earth, of the Heavens, of the Seas, of all things, and it is he who <hi>preſerveth both man and beaſt:</hi> he preſerveth all men in their ſingle and natural capacities; this I opened before. <hi>He preſerveth</hi> all men in their <hi>Political capacities,</hi> all his people in their <hi>Spiritual capacities.</hi> It is an ordinary obſervation in the Kingdoms and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of the world, that when they have grown to a great bigneſs, they have periſhed with their own bulk and weight. No Monarch hath been found ſufficient to preſerve them by his wiſdom and Counſels. And I remember the Hiſtorian ſpeaks of it to the great honour, and as a wonderful thing, in one of the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Kings, that he put the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom (it was no more then) into ſuch an order, that it was governed as if it had been but one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. But how much doth it ſpeak the Glory and Majeſty, the Immenſity and Omnipreſence, the Efficiency and Activity of God, who at the ſame time is working over all the Earth, in all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and Kingdoms, in all the Cities and Towns in it, defeating <hi>Ahitophels,</hi> diſcovering Plots and Conſpiracies, ruling the ſpirits of unruly men; ſo as the whole Univerſe is kept in order: and the thouſands and ten thouſands of men in it, that know not the yoke of Reaſon and Religion, are yet bridled by his Providence, and kept in ſome juſt order and decorum, and made, in ſtead of running one upon another, and deſtroying one another, mutually to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient one to another? I ſay, how great? how wiſe? how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite? how glorious in power muſt this God be?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Obſerve how much mercy paſſeth over our heads,</hi>

                     <hi>which we do take little or no notice of:</hi> We are <hi>fearfully and wonderfully preſerved,</hi> and that in every capacity. I ſhewed you it before as
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:192227:66"/>to our <hi>natural capacity,</hi> few think of that; what a ſtrange work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Providence there muſt be to keep our ſouls in life but one day: It is as much remarkable in our <hi>Political capacity.</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when Chriſt ſent out his Diſciples to Preach, he told them, That <hi>he ſent them out as lambs amongſt wolves.</hi> It is true indeed, not only of <hi>Goſpel-Preachers,</hi> but of all ſober and vertuous men, that would live in the world but according to the Laws of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Moral vertue.</hi> They are in the world as lambs amongſt wolves: Let but any one conſider how many lewd, unrighteous, debauched men are in all places, ſuch whoſe only rule is their luſts: how full the world is of men that make no conſcience of murthers, rapes, thefts, oppreſſion, and other enormities, and then ſtand and wonder at the Providence of God, that in any part of the world there is any thing of order and decorum obſerved, that men have any thing which they can call their own, that the lives of Princes or ſober people are ſecured. What can it be attributed to, but the mighty power of Divine Providence, that we have no more mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, rapes, thefts, &amp;c. we ſee laws, puniſhments will not reſtrain all, nor the ſame men at all times; how, or whence is it, that they reſtrain any, or at any time? I will conclude this with what the Pſalmiſt ſo often maketh the foot in that his admirable ſong of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107, <hi>Oh! that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, for his wonderful works to the children of men!</hi> Oh that Princes would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs! It is by him that they reign, that they have a days liberty to decree juſtice; by him that the Counſels of <hi>Ahitophel</hi> are defeated, the conſpiracies of ungodly men are diſcovered; that the ſpirits of unruly and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men are ſubdued under them: by him that they have wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to make Laws, and liberty to execute them: that men in their dominions are diſpoſed into their ſeveral orders, ranks and ſtations, ſo as mutually to ſerve one another, and to uphold the whole. Oh <hi>that Subjects would praiſe the Lord for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</hi> that they have wiſe Magiſtrates, good Laws, that their lives are not Sacrificed to murtherers, that their houſes are not fired, that their Wives and Virgins are not raviſhed, that they are diſpoſed to Trades and Occupations: that they have wiſdom for them, a ſpirit to them. Let every Citizen, every Subject, ſee and acknowledg the hand of the Lord in theſe things, and bleſs his holy name.</p>

                  <p>I AM (as you know) diſcourſing concerning the Principal Acts of <hi>Actual Providence,</hi> which I told you were two: 1. <hi>Preſervation,</hi> 2. <hi>Government.</hi> All things were at firſt created by a <hi>Divine word of Power:</hi> all things are preſerved by a Divine Power; He <hi>upholdeth all things by the word of his Power</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle). This I have done with: but Gods actual Providence doth not extend only to the upholding and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of all his creatures, but he <hi>governeth them alſo.</hi> Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecteth their ſeveral beings and capacities: <hi>Government</hi> reſpecteth their <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi> For a Diſcourſe upon this I have made choice of this Text, and chuſing it with that deſign only, I do not take my ſelf ſo much concerned to enquire into its relation to what went before, or followeth. I ſhall only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in it ſelf: and ſo it giveth you an account,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Of the Royal Seat of the Divine reſidence, or place</hi> where God more gloriouſly manifeſts that Preſence, which yet filleth Heaven and Earth. <hi>He hath</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>his throne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the heavens.</hi> 2. <hi>The vaſtneſs of his Imperial royal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and dominion; His Kingdom</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>ruleth over all.</hi> I ſhall not meddle with the firſt part: it is the ſecond only which I have to do with. The Propoſition ſhortly is this:</p>
                  <p>Prop. <hi>That he whoſe Throne is in Heaven, governeth the whole Creation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:192227:67"/>
                  <p>The Scripture ſpeaketh plentifully to this point of Gods Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal dominion, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.31, <hi>Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoyce; and let men ſay amongſt the Heathen, The Lord reigneth.</hi> Pſalm 96.10, <hi>Say amongſt the heathen the Lord reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Pſalm 93.1, <hi>The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with Majeſty,</hi> &amp;c. Pſalm 97.1, <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoyce.</hi> Pſalm 99.1, <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the people tremble.</hi> An Heathen Prince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.3, 34. But not to multiply Texts, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will evince it; every Superiour being hath a kind of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral right to rule over thoſe that are inferiour to it: and God being the Supreme Being, and the Creator of all other beings too, hath a natural right to extend a Kingdom and Dominion over all; and that not only as he is Superior to them, and greater than they are, but alſo as he is the efficient cauſe of all, the Creator of all things. But to ſpeak more particularly: we will enquire, 1. <hi>What Government is;</hi> 2. <hi>What are the Objects of this vniverſal Government and Dominion,</hi> which the Propoſition aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto God; 3. <hi>What are thoſe ſpecial acts, by which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth this Dominion and Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Government</hi> implieth three things: 1. <hi>The fixing of ſome ends.</hi> 2. <hi>A power inveſted in ſome one or more perſons, upon others, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and directing them in order to that end.</hi> 3. <hi>The exerciſe of this Power.</hi> The end of Government amongſt men, is uſually the peace, quiet and ſettlement of a place: Gods End is his own glory; He hath made all things for himſelf, and he doth all things for himſelf, for the fulfilling of his own Counſels and Will, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the glorifying of his holy Name. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Of him,</hi> and <hi>for him</hi> are all things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Government</hi> implieth <hi>a power inveſted in one or more perſons in order to an end.</hi> Now that God hath ſuch a power none can deny and acknowledg him to be God; <hi>Once have I ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yea twice have I heard it</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto God.</hi> He who confeſſeth God to be almighty, and able to do whatſoever he pleaſeth, muſt own him to have a power ſufficient for an Univerſal Government. If we take Power for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Right to exerciſe a power over ſuch and ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that alſo God hath by the very law of Nature; <hi>Hath not the potter a power over the clay?</hi> and is not the creature the clay, and God the potter?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But thirdly, <hi>Government implieth yet ſomething more,</hi> viz.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:192227:68"/>
                     <hi>an actual exerciſe of this power;</hi> and indeed this is the main: <hi>Actual Government</hi> is <hi>the exerciſe of a power, wherewith a perſon or perſons, are inveſted over ſome perſons, or things in order to ſome wiſe ends.</hi> But let me come to the ſecond Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>What are the particular Objects of this Divine providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Government?</hi> The Text ſaith, <hi>His Kingdom ruleth over all.</hi> I think that term <hi>all</hi> is to be expounded by three general heads: 1. <hi>The beings and exiſtences of his creatures.</hi> 2. <hi>The motions and actions of his creatures.</hi> 3. <hi>The omiſſions and obliquities of his creatures:</hi> all theſe (as I ſhall ſhew you) fall under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Providence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Beings and exiſtences of his creatures,</hi> the production and ceſſation of them; the giving of them Being belongs to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ordering and directing their beings under their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances belongeth to Providence: ſo doth the iſſue and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their beings with their circumſtances; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 68.20, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God belong the iſſues from death.</hi> Providence holdeth the key of the Womb, and the key of the Grave; he it is that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and maketh alive. From that it is that one generation paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, another cometh; and this holdeth to all creatures: <hi>There is not a ſparrow which falleth to the ground without the will of our heavenly Father,</hi> as our Saviour telleth us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond object of this <hi>Providential Government,</hi> is all the <hi>motions and actions of his creatures:</hi> all their operations accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſeveral forms and natures of being. There are ſome motions and actions of reaſonable creatures: I mean, ſome of their moral actions influenced from their wills, upon which God hath no efficient influence; ſuch are mens ſins and obliquities, but there are none but he ordereth and governeth, when done and brought into effect; even with the vileſt actions of men God hath thus much to do. 1. <hi>To uphold their natural powers and faculties while they do them.</hi> 2. <hi>To order and govern them, when done,</hi> to his own wiſe ends, ſo as they ſhall iſſue in the glory of his holy and bleſſed Name: and that brings me to the Third.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third Object of the government of Providence, is the <hi>Omiſſions, Errours and oblique actions of his creature.</hi> Every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture moveth not according to a Divine Rule, man only varieth; the <hi>ſtormy winds fulfil his word;</hi> the Sun, Moon, Stars, all obey his Law; man only rebels, and is guilty of thouſands of obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and <hi>Omiſſions.</hi> Now theſe alſo are under the government
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:192227:68"/>of Providence, ſome corrupt inclinations and luſtings he reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; Others he ſuffers to break out into action, then <hi>maketh the wrath of man to praiſe him.</hi> But this is enough to have ſpoken to the ſecond Queſtion, the third followeth:</p>
                  <p n="3">3d Queſt. <hi>By what particular acts doth Providence ſhew it ſelf in the Government of the World?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. To this I ſhall anſwer in ſeveral particulars: 1. <hi>By cauſing the production and exiſtences of his creatures, or making them to ceaſe as it pleaſeth him;</hi> He cauſeth the barren wombs, and again maketh the barren to bring forth Seven. Hence you ſhall find the multiplication of <hi>Abrahams ſeed</hi> to the number of the grains of the duſt of the Earth, or ſands upon the-Sea-ſhore, is made the matter of a Divine Promiſe. The Beings of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are both the objects of his Government, and his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils</hi> or Inſtruments in Governing; for he governeth a great part of the inferiour creatures by the Superiour influenced with Reaſon and Wiſdom for that end. God bleſſed man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. ſaying, <hi>Have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the fiſh of the ſea, and the fowls of the air, and every mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature that moveth upon the Earth.</hi> Now the Lord in order to this Government, multiplieth or diminiſheth them: whence is it, but from this Providence of God, that the wild Beaſts are not multiplied to the deſtruction of man? that we are not ſo full of <hi>Lions, Bears, Tygers, Wolves, Foxes</hi> and other hurtful creatures, as we are of ſheep and Neat-cattel, though many of them often bring forth young in greater plenty than thoſe uſeful unto man? Thus alſo God ordereth the reaſonable World: ſhould men live as in the firſt age of the World, to five, ſix, ſeven hundred years; ſhould all children born live to an old age, there would be no room on the Earth, there would not be food enough for them: God therefore in order to the Government of the Univerſe, as well as for the puniſhment of the multitude of ſins committted in the Earth, limiteth the number of Individuals, and diminiſheth them; and this not only in an ordinary courſe of nature, ſhortening the periods of their life, but by ſome extraordinary diſpenſations: ſuch as thoſe of War, Peſtilence, and other fatal and Epidemical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, by which he not only ſerveth the great end of his glory in puniſhing the ſins of men, but alſo reduceth the World to a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable body, and to ſuch a paſs, that one ſort of his creatures is ſufficient for the ſervice of another, ſo as the whole is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:192227:69"/>But this is but the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God governeth the World (Secondly) <hi>by maintaining the laws and ordinances of Nature.</hi> As there are poſitive Laws, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Laws in the Word of God, which God hath ordained for the government of reaſonable creatures: ſo there are Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Nature, by which creatures not indued with reaſon move, and work in order to the preſervation of the whole, by the mutual ſervice each of other. Thus <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.35, you read of the <hi>Ordinances of the Moon and Stars,</hi> and <hi>of Gods covenant of the day, and of the night,</hi> that they ſhould be in their ſeaſon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.20. Such an Ordinance you have, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.22. <hi>While the Earth remaineth, ſeed-time, and harveſt, and cold and heat, and ſummer and winter, and day and night ſhall not ceaſe.</hi> By vertue of theſe Ordinances it is that the <hi>Sun every day riſeth, and ſetteth upon one part of the world,</hi> cauſing day and night; <hi>rejoycing as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom to run its courſe</hi> (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh), that at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the year it is nearer, another it is further off this, or that part of the Earth. Theſe Laws and Ordinances of Nature are nothing elſe than the <hi>affections,</hi> and <hi>inclinations</hi> of ſeveral creatures to their ſeveral motions and actions. Now theſe affections and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations were put into them in the day of their Creation, but the Providence of God maintaineth theſe Laws: and hence it is, that ſeed-time and harveſt, cold and heat, ſummer and winter, do not ceaſe. By this it is, that the proud waters ordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not the bounds of the ſands which God hath ſet to limit them: The winds do not always blow from the ſame quarter, nor at the ſame rate. The Earth brings forth its variety of fruits: there are thouſands of things, of which we can give no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count than that they cauſe ſuch effects, they make ſuch motions by an Ordinance of Nature, by a Law which God imprinted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in the day of their Creation; and God preſerveth them by his Providence, which daily worketh in upholding theſe Laws, and regulating the creature that it moveth not, nor acteth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third thing wherein the <hi>Government of Providence</hi> is ſeen, is in the <hi>miraculous ſuſpenſion of theſe natural Laws and Ordinances, according to the good pleaſure of God.</hi> Indeed this is a ſpecialty of Providence, and more proper to be handled under that head: I ſhall therefore only touch it here. It is a thing which God ſeldom or never doth, but for ſome more than ordinary declaration of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:192227:69"/>or Mercy. Thus he ſuſpended the law <hi>of day and night,</hi> to plague the <hi>Egyptians</hi> with three days continued darkneſs. He ſuſpended again the law of Nature for the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might paſs over it in ſafety. By an Ordinance and law of Nature the fire burneth, the hungry Lions devour men; God ſuſpendeth both theſe Laws in the caſe of the three Children, and of <hi>Daniel:</hi> by an Ordinance of Nature, the Sun keepeth its courſe, and is in a continual progreſſive motion; God ſuſpendeth its motion in <hi>Joſhuah's</hi> caſe, altereth it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to come back in the caſe of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Kings 20.10: by the Ordinance of Nature, the Earth brings forth her fruit, ſo doth the womb ordinarily; God ſuſpends this Law in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Earth is made as Iron, the Heaven as Braſs: <hi>men commit whoredom, yet do not encreaſe; they eat, and have not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi> Hoſ. 4.10. This both demonſtrates the governance of Divine Providence, and alſo ſheweth how God exerciſeth it. This is a third Particular.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth Particular, wherein God ſheweth his Dominion over all, and exerciſeth his Government over the whole Creation, is <hi>his influencing all creatures to their natural actions, either in a more ordinary, or extraordinary manner.</hi> Every living creature hath its natural <hi>motions, and actions,</hi> and powers and faculties in order to them, which are the principles of thoſe operations; and in the upholding of thoſe powers to thoſe natural motions and actions, God exerteth and putteth forth his <hi>preſerving power</hi> of Providence: but his extraordinary influencing of them to ſome motions and actions, which are not in a natural courſe and order, doth more eminently ſhew the Governing power of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. That <hi>Locuſts</hi> and Caterpillers ſhould feed upon graſs and green herbs, this is but their natural motion and action ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their nature and the kind of their being; but that they ſhould come in troops, and rather feed upon one place than upon another, till they had devoured all the graſs and green herbs in <hi>Egypt,</hi> this was extraordinary: <hi>Pſalm</hi> 105.24, <hi>He ſpake; and the Caterpillers came; and did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured all the fruit of their ground.</hi> And again, Pſalm 74.46, <hi>He gave their increaſe to the Caterpiller.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid for the Flies, Lice, Frogs, and other creatures uſed as a plague upon <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> but indeed this is rather a ſpecialty of Providence, than belonging to the ordinary Government of it;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:192227:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>though very demonſtrative of the governing power of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fifth act, by which the Providence of God exerciſeth its governing power and influence, is, <hi>His daily raiſing up and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing Governours for the Houſholds and Societies of men, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving checks to them upon their miſcarriages, and mal-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The governing Providence of God, exerteth it ſelf either more <hi>immediately,</hi> or <hi>mediately.</hi> Other creatures God ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily governeth by <hi>men:</hi> many of them, I mean, influencing man with Reaſon and Diſcretion, by which he ruleth, ordereth, and governeth them, though many of them be much more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and powerful than he: the mouth of the <hi>horſe and mule which have no underſtanding,</hi> by the Providence of God ſo influencing man, are <hi>held with the bit and bridle, leſt they come near unto us,</hi> Pſalm 32.9. The Whale is ſmitten <hi>with a ſpear,</hi> wild <hi>bulls</hi> and <hi>boars</hi> are hunted down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Ox is tamed and brought to ſerve our uſes, who are much leſs in ſtrength than he is. <hi>Men</hi> alſo are governed by <hi>men;</hi> the weaker by thoſe that are more wiſe and powerful: but whence have the Governours their wit and power, their wiſdom and underſtanding, prompting them to make Laws acceptable to the greater part of Subjects, ſo as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies are of the leſſer number, and ſubdue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o the greater and keeps them in order? Is it not from the Lord, great in wiſdom, and wonderful in counſel? <hi>Pſalm</hi> 75.7, <hi>God is the Judg, he pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth down one, and ſetteth up another, and by him Kings reign.</hi> God ruleth the World by Magiſtrates: which if well conſidered, would aw men to that duty of honour and obedience which they owe to thoſe that are their Superiours; and may make us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how we ought to be ſubject for conſcience-ſake, and for Gods ſake in things commanded, which we cannot ſay are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Divine Law, nor ſo appear to us, and have any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt appearance of good for the government and peace of the whole. As on the other ſide, it calls to <hi>Kings to be wiſe, and the Judges of the Earth to be inſtructed to ſerve the Lord with fear,</hi> and to rejoyce before him in <hi>their great capacities with trembling:</hi> Pſal. 2.10, 11, they are but the Lords <hi>Vice-Roys;</hi> and as <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> told his Judges, <hi>they judg not for themſelves, but for the Lord;</hi> for him whoſe Throne is prepared in the Heavens, and whoſe Kingdom is over all. They ought therefore (according to the command to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) to <hi>have the book of the law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:192227:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>them, and to be reading therein all the days of their life;</hi> and where that doth not give them particular direction to have the <hi>honour and glory of God</hi> yet in their Eye, to meaſure all their laws and actions according to that Rule; to remember <hi>God is the Judg,</hi> and hath only exalted and dignified them to rule the World, or this or that part of the World by them: ſtill the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is the Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. A ſixth particular act by which God providentially go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth the World, is, <hi>By influencing the ſouls of ſome in it to ſuch actions as more immediately tend to his honour and glory.</hi> God hath an honour and glory from the <hi>natural complexion,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi> and motions of <hi>inanimate Beings.</hi> Pſal. 148.6, 8. Thus the Heavens, and in them the Sun, Moon, Stars; from them the ſnow, rain, hail, meteors, the lightning and thunder, the cold and heat, the vapours and ſtormy winds bring glory to God: <hi>ſtormy winds fulfilling his word,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt. The heavens declare the glory of God, the Earth ſheweth his handy-work,</hi> Pſalm 19.1. God hath made in the Heavens a tabernacle for the Sun, a courſe for the Moon and Stars: the very complexions of them, their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and neceſſary motions bring God abundance of glory. Now this ariſeth from a neceſſary cauſation, they cannot but do it. The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>brute creatures,</hi> though animate, not acting upon Election: The Whale in the Sea; the <hi>Lion</hi> and <hi>Tiger</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the beaſts; the <hi>Eagle</hi> and others amongſt the birds; the <hi>Bee,</hi> the <hi>Silk-worm,</hi> and others amongſt Inſects: ſeveral ſorts of creeping things glorify God, but it is neceſſarily. Man only amongſt earthly creatures glorifieth God voluntarily from a principle within himſelf, and upon choice. Take mankind in the general, it is a noble piece of Gods Creation, and neceſſarily glorifieth God. <hi>Man is fearfully</hi> and <hi>wonderfully made,</hi> his body is an admirable ſtructure, but the great glory which God hath is from his ſpiritual actions. Man is not a mute Preacher of Gods glory, as the Heavens and the Earth, the Sun, Moon and Stars are, or brute creatures are. He hath a Soul, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, will, affections; from theſe God expects a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and glory. But now take man in his depraved eſtate, and he doth nothing leſs; No creatures, but the evil Angels ſo much diſhonour God, and ſo croſs him in the great end of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World, which is his glory. Now it pleaſeth God to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſome of the children of men, to ſuch actions as do truly and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:192227:71"/>immediately tend to his glory, <hi>ex intentione agentis,</hi> from the intention, will and deſign of the agents; and alſo <hi>ex fine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> from the end and iſſue of the action: ſuch are <hi>acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, faith,</hi> and all <hi>manner of holineſs.</hi> The glory of God in theſe actions, is firſt in the intention of the agent, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the iſſue of the work. <hi>Joſhua</hi> exhorteth <hi>Achan</hi> to confeſs his ſin, and <hi>give glory to God:</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, <hi>That Abraham was ſtrong in the faith, giving glory to God.</hi> And our Saviour tells his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8, <hi>Herein is my father glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, if you bring forth much fruit,</hi> the fruit of Holineſs. Now ſo depraved is the heart of man, that he neither could nor would do any of them, if not influenced and over-powered by God; <hi>Without me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you can do nothing.</hi> God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as to actions of this nature, doth influence the heart of man, making him willing and <hi>able;</hi> ſo that as to the event the actions are neceſſary, but as to the manner of working they do them free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, willingly and chearfully: and this is another piece of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providence, by which he ruleth and governeth the motions and actions of men to his praiſe.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A ſeventh act, by which God governeth the motions and actions of rational creatures. 1. His <hi>permiſſion</hi> and <hi>overruling their oblique intentions and actions.</hi> 1. He permitteth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. 2. He overruleth and ordereth them, when done, to his own ends. Concerning Gods <hi>permiſſion of ſin,</hi> I may have hereafter a more proper and particular opportunity to ſpeak. His <hi>overruling</hi> and <hi>ordering</hi> of them, when done, to his own wiſe ends, is what I ſhall ſpeak to, and but ſhortly in this place. It is the great art and wiſdom of a civil or military Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, amongſt men, to make uſe of the ſeveral humours and paſſions of thoſe under his Command, to make them ſerve the great ends which he hath propoſed to himſelf in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The great and infinite power and wiſdom of God in the Government of the world, is in this wonderfully perſpicuous; making uſe of the ſeveral luſts, paſſions, and humours of men to his own praiſe and glory; for God governeth man ſo, as he putteth no force upon his will: If he doth any thing that is good, acceptable, and well-pleaſing unto God, he doth it willingly and freely. The power of God indeed is ſeen in making ſome ſouls willing; <hi>he giveth to will,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle), not in overruling him, to do the action whether he will or no:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:192227:71"/>Man acting thus freely, many men do that which is evil from the ſinful inclination of their own hearts, not corrected by the power of Divine Grace. God permits mens ſins, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.16, <hi>Who in times paſt ſuffered all Nations to walk in their own ways;</hi> but the actions being done, his power is ſeen in <hi>overruling the oblique action,</hi> beyond, or quite contrary unto the intention of the agent, to the glory of his holy and great name: this is that which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.10, <hi>Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe him, and the remainder of wrath he ſhall reſtrain.</hi> You have an eminent Text to prove this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7, <hi>O Aſſyria, the rod of mine anger, and the ſtaff in their hand is mine indignation. I will ſend him againſt an hypocritical nation, and againſt the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the ſpoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like mire in the ſtreets. Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo, but it is in his heart to deſtroy, and to cut off nations not a few.</hi> The buſineſs was this: <hi>Iſrael</hi> (that is, the ten tribes) had grievouſly provoked God; God was determined to puniſh them, they were <hi>an hypocritical Nation:</hi> There muſt be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to bring divine wrath upon them. <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſhall be the inſtrument, therefore called, <hi>the rod of Gods anger,</hi> and the ſtaff of his <hi>indignation.</hi> Poſſibly the inward cauſe moving the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> was his own luſt, the enlargement of his Territories; ſome revenge of himſelf, the robbing of their treaſures: he meant not ſo, his heart never did think ſo meerly to ſerve God, in the execution of his wrath; but herein was the governing and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruling Providence of God ſeen, that he ſo ruled the luſt, ambition, and revenge of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> that he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed his pleaſure upon mount <hi>Zion.</hi> And indeed thus God doth, as to all the ſinful actions of men, God will have his glory from them, but it is by the overruling power of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: the ſinner meaneth not ſo, neither is it in his heart to think ſo. The perſecutor ſaith, I will ſatisfie my luſt, or I will ſupply my ſelf with moneys for the ſatisfaction of my luſt, that is his end: in the mean time God by his Providence overruleth his malitious actions, ſo as he chaſteneth his people for their ſins, and ripeneth the ſinner for deſtruction. God in this doth with ſinners, as the wiſe <hi>Faulconer</hi> doth with the <hi>Hawk:</hi> The <hi>Hawk</hi> is a bird of prey, a ravenous bird, that flyeth at the <hi>Pheaſant</hi> or <hi>Partridg</hi> for it ſelf, to ſatisfie its rapacious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:192227:72"/>but the <hi>Faulconer,</hi> by his art, tameth the <hi>Hawk,</hi> and maketh uſe of its ravenous quality to ſerve his own table: and this is a wonderful piece of Divine Providence in governing of the world; Moſt of the motions and actions of men in it are diametrically oppoſite to Gods glorious end, yet they are all made to ſerve the manifeſtation of Gods glory, and to bring about his great deſigns in the world. But this is enough to have ſpoken Doctrinally, to this point of the Governing-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God. I cannot at this time compaſs all, which I would ſpeak of for the Application of this point.</p>

                     <hi>how great the God of Heaven muſt neceſſarily be,</hi> and that, not only in reſpect of the immenſity of his Being, <hi>as he filleth Heaven and Earth;</hi> but in reſpect of his activity and power: he is called the King of Kings, the ruler of Princes. The <hi>Perſians</hi> thought themſelves great Princes that ruled one hundred and twenty ſeven Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. The <hi>Turk</hi> glorieth in the greatneſs of his Empire; ſo doth the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> upon whoſe dominions, they ſay, the Sun never ſitteth. But alas! what are all theſe to the Lords King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who <hi>ruleth over all,</hi> and that after another manner than any Earthly Prince, who exerciſeth a dominion over his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Vaſſals? how juſtly therefore is greatneſs aſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? and who is there that can be compared with him, or like unto him? The Unity of the Divine Being alſo may be concluded from hence, for if he ruleth over all, then all is ſubject unto him; and there cannot be another God imagined, but muſt be in ſubjection unto him. Indeed ſuch a ſubjection, or ſubordination, the Heathens fancied amongſt their idols. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> was their ſupreme idol, others were ſubject unto him; but he is no God that can truckle under another, and be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto any Being. And this greatneſs of God calleth to all men to fear before him, and do reverence unto him: who ſhall not fear before that God, <hi>whoſe throne is prepared in the heaven, and whoſe Kingdom ruleth over all?</hi> and for a free and voluntary ſubjection to him, for he ruleth over all, not as a Tyrant and Oppreſſor, whoſe title lies in his Sword, but as one who is a native Prince, and hath a rightful title, not to obey whom is the <hi>higheſt Rebellion,</hi> which <hi>Samuel</hi> compareth to <hi>the ſin of witchcraft.</hi> But I muſt leave the diſtinct and full application of this Doctrine for a further diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>I Am at this time to make Application of what you have heard, concerning the <hi>Governing-Providence of God.</hi> I ſhall do it under three Heads, ſhewing you how it may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> for <hi>Conſolation,</hi> and for <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, you may conclude from hence, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> In what ſenſe alone any thing can be ſaid to be <hi>caſual</hi> or <hi>neceſſary;</hi> what to determine concerning <hi>Chance,</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> or <hi>Fate.</hi> As to the firſt I ſhall only lay down this Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> That although many things, as to our eyes, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of them, may appear <hi>caſual,</hi> yet <hi>there is nothing ſo with reference unto God,</hi> the firſt univerſal cauſe. It is truly ſaid by <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that <hi>chance</hi> and <hi>fortune</hi> are but terms of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ignorance; as we ſay of the old Philoſophers occult qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, they are but the refuges of ignorance: ſo the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>chance</hi> and <hi>fortune.</hi> He deſcribed <hi>chance</hi> well, that called it <hi>inopinatum rei eventum,</hi> an event of a thing which man thought not of; it is not <hi>inordinatus eventus,</hi> but <hi>inopinatus:</hi> there is no event of any thing that is a ſlip of Providence, not ordered and diſpoſed by him, whoſe <hi>Kingdom ruleth over all.</hi> Beings and exiſtences, motions and actions, yea, errours and obliquities; nothing cometh to paſs in the world, but was foreſeen, fore-ordained, fore-ordered, and that in infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: but many things come to paſs which we did not think
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:192227:73"/>of, could not foreſee whoſe cauſes are hidden from us: theſe things, we ſay, come by <hi>chance</hi> and <hi>fortune:</hi> A word indeed not very fit for a Chriſtians mouth. I remember <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> more than once, repents that he had defiled his tongue with it. The Heathens ignorant of the true God, and of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on all things, deviſed ſuch a blind God as <hi>Fortune;</hi> and aſſigned it a place amongſt their other Idols: <hi>Te facimus fortuna Deum.</hi> But Chriſtians muſt own no ſuch blind cauſe of things: they believe there is a God, <hi>whoſe throne is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the Heavens, and whoſe Kingdom ruleth over all;</hi> and therefore can leave no place for <hi>chance</hi> or <hi>fortune.</hi> You read of a caſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.5, which one would think, if any thing in the world were caſual and fortuitous, that were ſo. <hi>A man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the Wood, with his neighbour, to hew wood; and his hand fetcheth a ſtroke with the ax to cut down a tree, and the head ſlippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour that he dye.</hi> What can be imagined more caſual and fortuitous than this, for the head of an Hatchet to fly off from the helve, and to kill a man at work with him who had the Hatchet? ſuch were the caſes alſo mentioned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.22, 23. Caſting a thing <hi>upon a man without laying of wait;</hi> or <hi>with any ſtone,</hi> wherewith a man may dye, <hi>ſeeing him not,</hi> nor <hi>ſeeking his harm:</hi> yet in theſe caſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.13, God is ſaid <hi>to deliver the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſlain into his hand,</hi> who involuntarily and unwarily hath been the cauſe of his death. There are many things, which indeed to us are caſual, nothing is ſo to God; he hath ordered all, he ruleth and governeth all actions. <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> and <hi>Cuſhi</hi> knew not of each others journey; or at leaſt he that ran firſt knew nothing of the others journey: they both met at the Court of <hi>David</hi> to carry tydings of <hi>Abſaloms</hi> death: but <hi>Joab</hi> had ordered the running of both. <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> caſually met <hi>Cuſhi</hi> there; but though it was caſual to him, it was not ſo to <hi>Joab</hi> who ſent him: I ſay, nothing is in it ſelf caſual, or with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto God caſual; with reſpect to us many things are ſo, that is, we do not know the cauſes of them; but God order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and directeth all; his Kingdom, his Rule and Government extendeth to it; his hand is in it, either permitting, or effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You may from hence conclude <hi>how things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Arminians</hi> make a great deal of ſtir about this, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:192227:73"/>charge thoſe, whom they call <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as maintaining a <hi>fatal neceſſity</hi> of all things. Let us examine the word <hi>Fate</hi> a little, we ſhall find a three or fourfold uſe of it; there is two or three ſorts of Fate, which we ſhall condemn as freely as any of them: but in a fourth ſenſe we ſhall find the word honeſt enough, and to deſtroy it, will ask better arguments than any they have yet favoured the world with.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a Stoical fate.</hi> The Stoicks were a ſort of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philoſophers; you read of their name in Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.18. They fancied an <hi>eternal neceſſity of things, Cui &amp; Deum licet nolentem ſubeſſe fingebant nexum in rebus ipſis;</hi> to which, they conceived God himſelf, though againſt his will, was ſubjected: according to this they fancied all things came to paſs by an equal neceſſity, and that the wills of men were forced by it. This is a fate to be abominated by all thoſe that own God, and him as the firſt cauſe of all things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is <hi>a Mathematical fate.</hi> This was a neceſſity of things depending upon the motions and influences of the ſtars: theſe men indeed make God to be the ruler of the Stars, but the Stars to be the Rulers of mens motions and actions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that verſe in credit amongſt them, <hi>Aſtra regunt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, ſed regit aſtra Deus;</hi> as if God did not exerciſe a daily Dominion and Power over the Creation, but had made the celeſtial bodies, which being created, and ſet in their order, move other things by a fatal neceſſity. Of both theſe, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Si cor tuum non eſſet fatuum, non crederes fatum:</hi> if thou hadſt not a fooliſh heart, thou wouldſt not credit ſuch a thing as fate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is thirdly, <hi>a Phyſical or Natural fate,</hi> by which we underſtand that neceſſity which God hath eſtabliſhed in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſes; according to which, they cannot but produce ſuch and ſuch effects, ſuppoſing them not hindered by the ſupreme cauſe: thus the fire burneth neceſſarily, and we ſay, all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes move neceſſarily, and produce their effects, unleſs ſuſpended, hindered, or reſtrained by ſome ſuperiour cauſe: this is called in Scripture Gods Covenant with <hi>day</hi> and <hi>night, heat</hi> and <hi>cold, ſummer</hi> and <hi>winter.</hi> Such a neceſſity all muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, in the operation of all natural agents; the power and pleaſures of God only being reſerved to countermand their operations, which when he doth, we call it a miraculous work
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:192227:74"/>of God: thus, day and night, cold and heat, ſeed-time and harveſt, ſummer and winter are under a fate, they neceſſarily follow one another; but as God was the firſt cauſe of this neceſſity by the Covenant he eſtabliſhed, ſo their event is in the power of God to hinder, or ſuſpend, or alter as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But then, Laſtly, There is a <hi>Theological or Chriſtian fate,</hi> which is nothing but <hi>a neceſſity of event</hi> impoſed upon things by the moſt <hi>holy, wiſe, eternal, free purpoſe, and counſel</hi> of God, executed by his Providence. It is true, the name of <hi>fate</hi> ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ill, becauſe of the <hi>Stoical</hi> and <hi>Mathematical</hi> vanities about it; but if we take it for, <hi>Quod Deus in animo ſuo fatus eſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud ſe ſtatuit, ac decrevit:</hi> what God hath ſaid within himſelf, purpoſed and decreed, it is innocent enough. Now whoſo denieth a <hi>fate</hi> (if they will call it ſo), in this ſenſe, doth not ſo well, as he ſhould do, underſtand the Divine Nature, or the Scriptures. We neither deny (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine), an order of cauſes,</hi> which <hi>the will of God hath ſet;</hi> neither do we call it <hi>fate:</hi> In the mean time they are very ignorant, that cannot ſee the difference betwixt this <hi>neceſſity</hi> of <hi>events,</hi> and the <hi>Stoical fate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Stoicks ſubjected God himſelf to fate:</hi> this neceſſity dependeth upon the will of God as the cauſe of it. 2. They made their <hi>fate</hi> pre-exiſtent to God. 3. They aſſerted a <hi>fate</hi> that took away all the liberty of mans will. Now <hi>this is no conſequent</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) <hi>that if God hath ſet a certain or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all cauſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non eſt autem conſequens, ut ſi Deo certus eſt omnium cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ordo, nihil ſit in noſtrae vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio.</hi> Aug. l. 5. <hi>De Civ. dei.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>then nothing is in the power of our wills.</hi> The upſhot of all is this. We ſay there are a thouſand things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in reſpect of us caſually, and fortuitouſly, that is, we know not the cauſes of them, and manner of their operations, yet there is nothing ſo in reſpect of God. And though all things happen neceſſarily, as to the event, with reſpect to the decree of God, which hath ſet all things in an order; and in reſpect of the univerſal power, and influence of his Governing Providence; yet for ſuch things as are done by us, they are not neceſſarily brought forth, but freely: our will is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but acteth as a free agent. But I ſhall add no more to the firſt Branch of Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Branch.</hi> What you have heard, may <hi>help to confirm your
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:192227:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>Faith</hi> as <hi>to the glorious nature of God,</hi> and that in four or five Particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to his <hi>Omniſcience</hi> or knowledg of all things; He muſt needs know all things who governeth all things; He governs all the beings and exiſtences of his creatures, all their motions and actions, all their errours, obliquities and Omiſſions, as I have ſhewed you, which he could not do if they were not all naked in his ſight: all things muſt needs be open and naked in his ſight with whom we have to do. The Doctrine of Gods Omniſcience is evident from the work of Creation? He that made the Eye, ſhall he not ſee? He that made the Ear, ſhall he not hear? and it is evident from the work of Providence, if his Kingdom ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth over all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, It as much confirmeth us in the Doctrine of Gods <hi>Omnipotence. If his Kingdom ruleth</hi> over all: 1. He muſt have a power to Rule and govern all. 2. He muſt be in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to exerciſe this power, and there muſt be no power able to reſiſt him; So that you may ſee the Reaſonableneſs of thoſe titles given to God in Scripture, <hi>viz. The Lord God Omnipotent. The Almighty God.</hi> The <hi>King of Kings.</hi> The <hi>Lord of Lords.</hi> The <hi>Lord of all the Hoſts of Heaven and Earth.</hi> If there were any thing too hard for God; if he could be reſiſted, he could not <hi>rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, It may confirm you in the <hi>Activity of the Divine Eſſence.</hi> The Schoolmen ſay, That God is <hi>Totus Actus,</hi> wholly an Act, always moving, working, operating; ſo it muſt be if he hath ſuch a Rule, as I have been deſcribing to you. He muſt fill all places, not as a meer inactive <hi>moles,</hi> and bulk of a thing fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a place: but ſo as at the ſame time he is in all places at work, ſeeing, obſerving, governing, effecting, and directing, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining, and over-ruling. We have no Similitude to expreſs it by, but cometh much ſhort. That of the Soul in man comes neareſt it which is in all parts of the body, animating, actuating, and governing of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It confirms us in our belief of the <hi>Infinite wiſdom of God.</hi> He is called, The only <hi>wiſe God,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.17, and <hi>Jude v.</hi> 25. This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concludes it. We ſee it requires a great deal of wiſdom to govern <hi>a Family,</hi> and keep it (if it conſiſts of many members) in order; but much more to govern the greater bodies of people, in <hi>Towns, Cities, Kingdoms, Empires,</hi> &amp;c. Such a variety there is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:192227:75"/>of motions, humours, paſſions and tempers of people: Who is able to conceive what Wiſdom it requires to govern all beings in the World, all motions and actions of all creatures in the World, and to keep them in any order or decorum at all? In fine, Next to the work of Creation, there is nothing like the work of Providence well-ſtudied to give a man the true notion of God, and let us know what manner of Eſſence, the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence neceſſarily muſt be. Thus much by way of Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> This Doctrine ſerveth <hi>for the unſpeakable conſolation of the people of God.</hi> Pſalm 97.1, <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the Earth rejoyce; let the multitude of Iſles be glad thereof.</hi> It is matter of rejoycing to all the World that the Lord reigneth; and there is none ſo vile and wicked, but experienceth much (though many conſider it not) of the good effects of this univerſal Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which God exerciſeth. The Devils cannot do what they pleaſe in it; the wills and paſſions of men cannot have their ſwing. There is an Almighty One that holds the reins upon the brutiſh affections and paſſions of men; the ill effects of which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Atheiſts and contemners of God which live in the World, would quickly experience: but to the people of God, as being the leſſer number, the moſt hated and maligned part of the World, and the far weaker as to natural ſtrength and power; beſides the reſtraint their Souls are under from putting out what natural power and ſtrength they have beyond the Divine Law, doth moſt eminently demonſtrate to them the good effects of the Lords Reign, and the neceſſity of it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.7, <hi>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publiſheth ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that ſaith unto Zion, thy God reigneth?</hi> It is good news to all the World, <hi>that God reigneth;</hi> but particularly to <hi>Sion,</hi> to the Church and the people of God: to the whole viſible Church it is good tidings, but particularly to the inviſible part that is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant here on Earth, and the individual members thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Doctrine firſt is of great uſe to <hi>comfort them againſt, and under all their diſturbances for things which happen to the Church in general, or themſelves in particular.</hi> A ſhip at Sea were but in an ill caſe if it were not for him that ſate at the Helm: a skilful Pilot there ordereth her well enough, ſo as the winds ſerve his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; ſo it is with the Church toſſed with winds and waves, ſhe is only ſafe in the Lords government of all the affairs of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:192227:75"/>World. <hi>Luther</hi> (I remember) ſaith thus of himſelf; <q>I (ſaith he) have often attempted to preſcribe God ways and methods in the government of his Church, and other affairs. I have ſaid, <hi>Ah Domine, hoc velim ita fieri, hoc ordine, hoc eventu.</hi> I would have this thing thus done, in this order, with this event. But, ſaith he, God did quite contrary to what I asked of him. Then (ſaith he) I thought with my ſelf what I would have had, was not contrary to the glory of God, but would have been of great uſe for the ſanctifying of his Name. In ſhort, it was a brave deſign, well adviſed, but undoubtedly God laught at at this wiſdom of men: and ſaid, Go to now, I know you are a learned man, and a wiſe man; But it was never my manner to allow Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> or Saint <hi>Martin</hi> or any other, to inſtruct, teach, govern, or lead me. <hi>Non ſum Deus paſſivus, ſed acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus;</hi> I am not a paſſive, but an active God.</q> That great man and <hi>Melancthon</hi> were two famous Inſtruments in the <hi>Reformation of Germany,</hi> but of different tempers: <hi>Melancthon</hi> was a man of a more mild and gentle Spirit, and melancholick timerous temper. <hi>Luther</hi> was of a more fierce and bold temper. <hi>Melancthon</hi> would often write very troubled Letters to <hi>Luther</hi> about the ſtate of the <hi>Church affairs. Luther</hi> would conſtantly make uſe of this argument, from the Governing-Providence of God to ſupport <hi>Melancthon. Melancthon</hi> (ſaith he), <hi>Let God alone</hi> to govern <hi>the World; The Lord reigneth.</hi> It pleaſeth God ſo to order it in his Providence, that the face of affairs relating to the Church, often looks very ſadly, and there is nothing which giveth the ſpirits of the people of God a greater diſturbance. Now all theſe diſturbances are cauſed from our Not-attending to this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; which yet every good Chriſtian profeſſeth to receive, and to believe. Were we but rooted and grounded in the faith of this one Principle, <hi>That the Kingdom of God ruleth over all,</hi> and that he exerciſeth a ſpecial care and Government relating to his Church, and ruleth the World with a ſpecial regard to the good of his little flock, we could neither be immoderately diſturbed for the concern of the glory of God, nor yet for the Church of God. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.31, <hi>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoyce, and let men ſay amongſt the Nations, the Lord reigneth; let the Sea roar, and the fulneſs thereof, let the fields rejoyce, and all that is therein, Then ſhall the trees of the wood ſing out at the preſence of the Lord, becauſe he cometh to judg the Earth.</hi> Say
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:192227:76"/>therefore unto <hi>Zion, Thy God reigneth.</hi> Let <hi>Papiſts rage,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> ſcoff and threaten, and do what they can; Let all their Favourites take counſel together and join hand in hand: when they have done all they can, they will find, <hi>that the Lord reigneth.</hi> And this is enough to ſay unto <hi>Sion,</hi> or to any of her ſons and daughters. Two things are ſufficient in the moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom and tumultuous times to ſtill, ſupport, and comfort the ſpirits of Gods people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Lord reigneth;</hi> and hath an unqueſtionable ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendence upon all the Beings of his creatures, all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and all their actions: He is higher in power than the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>this God is our God.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> hinteth both in that excellent 46 <hi>Pſalm, v.</hi> 10, <hi>Be ſtill, and know that I am God; I will be exalted amongſt the Heathen, I will be exalted in the Earth: The Lord of Hoſts is with us: The God of Jacob is our refuge.</hi> Let not therefore thoſe that fear the Lord trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the motions of the World, and commotions in it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ragings of lewd men againſt the intereſt of Chriſt. Let them not trouble themſelves further than is their duty, <hi>viz.</hi> to be ſenſible of the rebukes of Divine Providence; <hi>The Lord reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, He that ſitteth in the heavens laugheth. The Lord ſhall have them in deriſion, and ſhall</hi> (one day) <hi>ſpeak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure;</hi> and let the World know, that <hi>yet he hath ſet his King upon his holy hill of Sion.</hi> I remember a paſſage of <hi>Luther, Si nos ruamus, ruet Chriſtus, unus Chriſtus ſcilicet, magnus ille regnator mundi,</hi> &amp;c. If we periſh (ſaith he) Chriſt muſt fall too; Chriſt, that great Governour of the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we did conſider this as we might, or ought, <hi>we ſhould alſo</hi> ſee as <hi>little reaſon to be diſturb'd, as to the concerns of our own Souls:</hi> with the fear of two things as to their own Souls ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the people of God are troubled: 1. <hi>The prevailings of their own luſts and corruptions.</hi> 2. <hi>The prevailings of Satans tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> This Doctrine of Divine Providence excellently ſerveth to ſtill our unquiet ſpirits, as to either of theſe troubles. If the Lords Kingdom be over all, both theſe fears muſt be vain and cauſeleſs: for ſuppoſing the faithfulneſs of the Promiſes; <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over your mortal bodies: God ſhall bruiſe Satan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your feet ſhortly: He will with the temptation give an happy
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:192227:76"/>iſſue.</hi> If the Lords Kingdom be over all, neither ſhall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prevail, nor Satan by temptations prevail to deſtroy the work of God in our Soul, or to prevent us or hinder us as to the Kingdom, which God hath prepared for us: for as he that hath promiſed is faithful, or cannot repent, or lye; ſo he is powerful, and hath a dominion over all beings, perſons, things, <hi>&amp;c. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is greater than all; none can pluck you out of my fathers hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, It affords us a relief <hi>againſt the ſad proſpect we have almoſt continually before our eyes, of the malicious actions of wicked and ungodly men.</hi> There is, and always was, a generation in the World, which ſleep not unleſs they do miſchief; they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually deviſing miſchievous devices againſt the little flock of Chriſt: Their counſels, deſigns, works, have a plain and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tendency to the ruin of the whole intereſt of God in the World, if poſſibly not to leave Chriſt a Name in the Earth, nor Religion, pure and undefiled Religion, a footing in any place: he that runs may read this day, that the malice of ſome is againſt no form in Religion, but the life, and power, and practice of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. The Devil their Maſter hath given them a command like that of <hi>Benhadads, Fight neither againſt ſmall nor great:</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> nor <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> but againſt the life and practice of Religion only. Who ſeeth not, that although a man hath a further latitude than others of his brethren, as to matters of Conformity: yet if he liveth an holy life, if he preſſeth Holineſs in his Pulpit, and practiſeth it in his Converſation, he maketh himſelf a prey to the <hi>common Enemies,</hi> both of <hi>Goſpel, Faith</hi> and converſation? But trouble not your ſelves, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, The Lord reigneth; the Frogs out of the bottomleſs pit, may through Gods permiſſion get out, and croak a while, but to the pit they muſt return again. A ſad time it was, when the Enemy ſaid to the <hi>Soul of the</hi> man <hi>according to Gods own heart, Flee as a bird to the mountains: when the wicked bent their bows, and made their arrows ready upon the ſtring, that they might pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily ſhoot at the upright in heart,</hi> Pſalm 11.2. <hi>When the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were deſtroyed, and the godly knew not what to do, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at ſuch a time?</hi> Obſerve the ſame <hi>Pſalmiſt, v.</hi> 4, <hi>The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lords throne is in heaven: his eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, his ey-lids try the children of men.</hi> I ſhall conclude this branch of Application with that <hi>Pſalm</hi> 99. <hi>v.</hi> 1, <hi>The Lord reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:192227:77"/>let the people tremble; he ſitteth between the Cherubims, let the Earth be moved: the Lord is great in Zion, and he is high above all people; Let them praiſe the Lords great and terrible Name, for it is holy.</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> This Doctrine is a foundation for a great deal of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: Every good Chriſtian upon hearing this Doctrine concerning Gods providential Kingdom, ſhould be ſaying, What now is my Duty? what ought I to do, <hi>if the Lord reigneth?</hi> I will tell you in five or ſix particulars, and ſo ſhut up this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning the main and principal acts of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An <hi>exerciſe of Faith</hi> ſeems a very reaſonable piece of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be concluded from theſe premiſes. By <hi>Faith</hi> here, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not an aſſent to the Propoſition of the word, nor yet a <hi>reſting</hi> upon the <hi>perſon of the Mediator</hi> (which is the juſtifying-act of faith); but <hi>committing of our ſelves unto God, and caſting our care upon him in all eſtates and conditions:</hi> a thing often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for in Scripture: <hi>Caſt thy burthen on the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 55.22. <hi>Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all your care upon him, for he careth for you,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.7. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 37.5. So <hi>Job</hi> 5.8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.3. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is called <hi>a Truſting in God,</hi> Pſalm 4.5, and 7.1. Pro. 28.25. and 29.5. Iſa. 57.13, <hi>&amp;c. Power</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are the things that ſupport and juſtifie one in truſting and putting confidence in another. This Doctrine concerning the general Providence of God in governing all, juſtifies him as to his Power, to be the true and ſole Object of our confidence. We can truſt in none elſe, but may be controuled. The greateſt Princes of the Earth are but men under the authority of one, who is higher than they; and a mans truſt in them, oft-times is but like the <hi>Jews</hi> truſting in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which the Prophet compareth to a leaning to a <hi>bruiſed reed,</hi> and upon a <hi>broken ſtaff,</hi> which are not able to bear the weight of a mans body; but if he leaneth upon them, they will run into his hand. If God be againſt us, man cannot protect from him, nor deliver out of his hand: therefore (ſaith the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> Pſalm 118.8, 9.), <hi>It is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in man: It is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in Princes:</hi> but he, <hi>whoſe Kingdom is over all,</hi> muſt needs be a proper Object of our confidence; and as our <hi>confidence in God</hi> is warranted from <hi>general Providence,</hi> as to the power of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:192227:77"/>God; ſo as <hi>to his love,</hi> it is ſecured from <hi>ſpecial Providence:</hi> but of that I hope to ſpeak diſtinctly, only a word here, leſt any ſhould ſay, But <hi>although the Kingdom of God be over all;</hi> ſo that upon the account of his Power, I may truſt in him; yet how doth it appear his Power ſhall be put forth for me? I ſhall but offer four <hi>Meditations to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the glory of God</hi> is the great end that he aimeth at in all his actions: He made all things for himſelf: he preſerveth, he governeth the World for himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That whereas God hath a twofold <hi>glory from his Creation,</hi> Paſſive, and Active: <hi>One</hi> wherein the creature doth nothing from an inward principle; thus <hi>the Heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> and every creature ſpeaks of his glory: The <hi>other</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the creature is <hi>Active,</hi> acting out of intention and deſign, and from the principle of its own will: This latter is that which is moſt pleaſing to God and acceptable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That God is capable of receiving no further glory from his creatures, than what floweth from the predication of his praiſe, and the doing of his Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, That from hence it muſt needs follow, <hi>That God is more glorified by his Church, and by his Saints, than by all the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beſides.</hi> God is mutely and paſſively glorified by other creatures: but <hi>in his Temple men ſpeak of his glory.</hi> The children of men, and amongſt them, only thoſe who are <hi>born of God,</hi> do voluntarily and out of choice bring glory to God. God (if I may ſo ſpeak) wreſts his glory from others, as from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp;c. God indeed in ſome ſenſe may be ſaid to be actively and voluntarily glorified by all Profeſſors; but only by that <hi>little flock</hi> whom he hath choſen to himſelf, with a full intention, voluntarily and ſincerely. They are the favourites of him, whoſe Kingdom is over all. Suppoſing then God to have a Dominion and Government over all, and to be continually in the exerciſe of it, ſurely, if <hi>Haman</hi> could ſay, <hi>Whom ſhould the King delight to honour but me?</hi> They may with much better right and advantage ſay, For whom ſhould the great <hi>King of kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of lords,</hi> exerciſe a Rule and a Dominion? For whoſe advantage ſhould the Lord govern the World, if not for thoſe who moſt <hi>freely, chearfully, voluntarily ſerve the greateſt end and deſign which he hath in the World,</hi> viz. his own glory; and can ſincerely ſum up all the deſires of their Souls, in that one Petition, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified?</hi> ſurely,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:192227:78"/>therefore the children of God have all obligations imaginable upon them under all viciſſitudes of Providence, to truſt in God, and to commit their ways unto the Lord. But this is but the firſt Duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A <hi>Second Duty</hi> which this <hi>Doctrine of Providence calleth to us for, and ſheweth us the reaſonableneſs of, is Prayer.</hi> We have reaſon in our diſtreſſes to ſeek unto God by Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Lord reigneth;</hi> and it is an encouragement to us to ſeek him, <hi>becauſe he reigneth:</hi> Whither ſhould we go but unto him who hath power to help, ſave and deliver? Prayer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath in all times of diſtreſs been the Refuge of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It was a ſad time with <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 109.4, <hi>The mouth of the wicked, and of the deceitful</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3.) <hi>are opened againſt me; they have ſpoken againſt me with a lying tongue. They compaſs me about alſo with words of hatred, and fought againſt me without a cauſe; for my love they are my adverſaries, but I give my ſelf unto Prayer,</hi> v. 4. <hi>Luther,</hi> when he was in any ſtrait, was wont to ſay, <hi>I will go and tell my God of it.</hi> Prayer hath been the conſtant mean which the people of God have uſed for reſcue out of any troubles. You ſee it is upon a good foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> The Dominion which God hath over all, and his daily exerciſe of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It calleth to you for <hi>praiſe and thanksgiving;</hi> Prayer ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciteth for a mercy when we want it: Praiſe acknowledgeth the gift when received, and giveth unto God the glory of it. Nor can it, without robbery, be paid at any other than Gods Altar. <hi>Is there any good done by thee?</hi> Let God have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that; thou haſt done it by vertue of a power or gift which is given to thee from above; yea, and it is from his <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning-Power</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> ruling, directing, and influencing thy heart to it: His Kingdom is over our hearts, our hands, our tongues, inclining them to every good thought, word, action; without him we can do nothing. <hi>Doth any good come unto thee?</hi> Let God alſo have the glory of that. The earthly Prince looketh that you ſhould acknowledg your peace, your trade to his Government; but he is but the inſtrument of God in bringing theſe things. It is the Kingdom of the Lord that ruleth over all; <hi>he gives thee power to get riches,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes):</hi> I am ſure the people of God have more ſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to acknowledg God in all their peace and proſperity. They
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:192227:78"/>are men of peace, their hands are againſt none; but the world hates them, they are as ſheep amongſt wolves; if they have any months or years of peace, they are beholden to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ruling of God for it. <hi>Is any evil kept from you?</hi> It is God that doth it, he that ruleth the raging of the Sea, he ſtilleth the tumults of the people; he hath the hearts of Kings in his hand, and turneth them as the Waters of the South. It is becauſe the Mountain of the Lord is full of Chariots and Horſes, that they are not ſwallowed up by their Enemies every moment. O ſee, and praiſe the Lord for the Governance of his Providence!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Doctrine calleth to you for <hi>patience in adverſity.</hi> The <hi>people of God are ſubjected to trials of adverſity;</hi> yea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o fiery trials, as well as other men, yea, in greater degrees than others: hence the Apoſtle calleth to them, to let <hi>patience have its perfect work.</hi> Patience is nothing elſe but a quiet ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the will of God under any adverſe diſpenſation of his Providence, in obedience to his command; and becauſe it is his will, and he layeth it upon us, <hi>we have need of patience,</hi> and the exerciſe of it is our duty; and this Doctrine will ſhew you that it is but a reaſonable duty. Let me ſhew it you in two or three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As it ſhoweth you, that all your afflictions (be they of what</hi> ſort and kind they will) <hi>are from the Lord,</hi> Job 5.6, <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions cometh not out of the duſt; nor doth trouble ſpring out of the ground. Is there</hi> (ſaith God by the Prophet) <hi>any evil in the City and I have not done it?</hi> Affliction comes not by <hi>chance</hi> or <hi>fate,</hi> it comes from God, and is the wiſe iſſue of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the Government of the World: we have therefore no reaſon to fret and vex our ſelves againſt inſtruments. They are but inſtruments. Perhaps (ſaid <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Shimei,</hi>) God hath bidden him curſe. They poſſibly do ill, and at laſt will know it; but God is righteous in their unrighteouſneſs. <hi>I held my peace</hi> (ſaith <hi>David), I knew it was thy doing. It is the Lord,</hi> (ſaith that good man) <hi>let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As it aſſureth us, that all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God.</hi> If God ruleth and governeth the world, he certainly doth it for himſelf, and for his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: which glory of his being the higheſt deſign of his people,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:192227:79"/>all things muſt neceſſarily tend to their good, to that which they above all things deſire and ſeek after. This God, who ruleth the World, is his peoples father, and doth what-ever he doth as a father for the good and advantage of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, It is a good Argument of patience, <hi>As it letteth them know, that their afflictions are ordered and governed by God.</hi> The Afflictions, Oppreſſions, Perſecutions of the people of God are not things excepted out of the Dominion of God. It was, you know, the Centurions faith, That diſeaſes were to Chriſt, as his ſervants were to him: He ſaid to one go, and he went; to another come, and he came; and to another do this, and he did it. So God ſpeaketh to diſeaſes; and not to diſeaſes only, but to all ſorts of afflictions: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.8, <hi>In meaſure when it ſhooteth forth thou wilt debate with it.</hi> God firſt cauſeth, then ruleth, and governeth all our troubles, afflictions and trials.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This Doctrine calleth to all the people of God <hi>for love to him.</hi> This is the Pſalmiſts Exhortation, and upon this very Argument, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.23, <hi>O Love you the Lord all you his Saints: for he preſerveth his Saints, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</hi> All the earth is bound to love the Lord for the exerciſe of his Governing-power. If the Lord did not reign, the worſt of men would quickly find the ill effects of it; they need no worſe enemies than their own brethren and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in wickedneſs, did the Lord lay the reins upon the necks of their luſts, and ſuffer them, as they would, to devour one another. For as we ſee the ravenous Birds, Fiſhes, and Beaſts, do not only prey upon other, but their own ſpecies: ſo, were it not for the Reſtraining-Providence of God in governing the world, the wicked of it would ſee their brethren in iniquity, not only preying upon the Saints and people of God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon thoſe like unto themſelves, if leſſer than themſelves. But, I ſay, above all the people of God, as being the leaſt flock, are more eſpecially bound to <hi>love the Lord</hi> for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Providence; but this will more eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when I come to diſcourſe concerning the Specialties of his Providence with reference to them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, This Doctrine calleth unto all <hi>for a willing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience unto God:</hi> This is that which we call <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:192227:79"/>There are two Arguments ariſing out of the former diſcourſe, which ought to have a force here.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us do what we will, God will be our Governour.</hi> Let <hi>Aſſyria</hi> mean, or not mean ſo, he ſhall be the Lords Servant, and execute his pleaſure, and no more. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may <hi>huff</hi> a little, and ask, <hi>Who is the Lord, that he ſhould ſerve or obey him:</hi> but God will at laſt be glorified on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and make him know his Kingdom is over all. God will diſappoint the <hi>devices of the crafty,</hi> ſo as their hands ſhall not find their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes. God will at laſt be glorified, and make all the wrath of man, at laſt, to praiſe him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. None ſhall be <hi>rewarded by God,</hi> or <hi>be his favourites, but only ſuch as yield him, free, willing, and chearful obedience.</hi> Let us do what we can, we cannot reſiſt his will; but unleſs our obedience be free, voluntary, and chearful, it ſhall never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by a juſt and righteous God. There is nothing more ordinary in the Prophets, than to read the denunciation of Gods judgments againſt <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Babylon;</hi> which were yet Gods ſervants in executing vengeance upon the hypocritical and rebellious <hi>Jews.</hi> Let this therefore mind us to be obedient to to the will of God, freely, and willingly, and ſincerely, that ſo we may hear that joyful voice, <hi>Well done, thou good and faithful Servant.—Enter thou into thy maſters joy.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have been for ſome time diſcourſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Providence, that is, <hi>Actual Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> which is nothing elſe but Gods <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care for his creatures,</hi> made (as you heard) <hi>by the word of his power.</hi> I have diſcourſed this care of God more <hi>generally,</hi> opening to you thoſe two more general Acts of God, by which this care is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 1. <hi>In preſerving of them.</hi> 2. <hi>In the rule and governance of them.</hi> I have ſhewed you the workings of Divine Providence, in the <hi>preſerving of his creatures in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> in their Beings, and uſe of their ſeveral faculties with which he created them; of man in particular, conſidered ſingly, as an <hi>individual,</hi> or <hi>in his Political capacity;</hi> or, 3. In his <hi>Spiritual capacity,</hi> as the <hi>ſubject of Divine Grace.</hi> I have alſo diſcourſed generally, concerning the <hi>Government of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi> and by what <hi>particular acts</hi> God exerciſeth this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:192227:80"/>and declareth <hi>his Dominion</hi> over all the Creatures which he hath made; but beſides the <hi>general care</hi> of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all his Creatures, there is alſo a <hi>ſpecial Providence.</hi> For the beginning of a diſcourſe concerning that, I have made choice of this Text: <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle). <hi>Non eſt vox dubitantis</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pareus),</hi> It is not the language of one that doubteth. The Apoſtle knew well enough that our Saviour had ſaid, That God <hi>cloatheth the Lillies,</hi> the graſs of the field; and that a <hi>ſparrow</hi> (though <hi>two of them are ſold for a farthing) falleth not to the ground without the will of our heavenly father.</hi> The words therefore only ſignifie an <hi>inequal care,</hi> viz. <hi>That God taketh a greater and more ſpecial care</hi> for ſome of his Creatures than he doth for others, and ſo it layeth a foundation for this Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>Prop. <hi>That God exerciſeth a ſpecial Providence for, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome of his creatures.</hi> He taketh a general care con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them all: but a more <hi>ſpecial care</hi> concerning ſome of them. That is <hi>the</hi> Propoſition which I ſhall handle in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſhew you that <hi>there is ſuch a ſpecial Providence,</hi> i.e. though the Lord taketh a general care of all his Creatures, according to their natures; yet he taketh a more particular and ſpecial care concerning ſome more than others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I will enquire, <hi>Which of his Creatures they are, as to which he exerciſeth a ſpecial Providence; and concerning which he tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch a more eſpecial care?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We will enquire by <hi>what acts God exerteth, putteth forth, and declareth this his eſpecial care.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, <hi>I will make ſome Application of the whole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God doth exerciſe a more particular care in the <hi>Preſervation</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of ſome of his Creatures than he doth of others, will appear,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By expreſs Scriptures which aſſert it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By promiſes made to ſome, in which others are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By experience and matter of fact.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By expreſs Scriptures: thus <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.12, <hi>Canaan</hi> is called <hi>a Land which the Lord careth for:</hi> ſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.30, <hi>If God ſo cloath the graſs of the field, which to day is, and to morrow
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:192227:81"/>is caſt into the Oven; Shall he not much more cloath you, O you of little faith?</hi> Matt. 10.31. <hi>Fear you not therefore, you are of more value than many ſparrows,</hi> ver. 29. Chriſt had let them know, that the Providence of God extended to the <hi>ſparrows;</hi> two of them were ſold for a farthing, but not one of them fell to the ground without God: but (ſaith he) you are better than many ſparrows, God will more regard you, and take more care of you, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10, <hi>He is the Saviour of all men, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of them who believe.</hi> Pſal. 33. <hi>v.</hi> 13, <hi>He beholdeth all the ſons of men:</hi> but <hi>Verſe</hi> 18, <hi>The eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him: upon them that hope in his mercy, to deliver their ſoul from death, and to keep them alive from famine:</hi> ſo this Text, <hi>Doth God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>take care for Oxen?</hi> or doth he ſay it <hi>altogether for our ſakes? for our ſakes no doubt.</hi> It is true, there are degrees and differences as to this <hi>ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew you hereafter: I am only, as yet, evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the thing in general.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the <hi>promiſes of God</hi> made to ſome men, not to others, are a proof of this; for what is a promiſe but the Revelation of Gods Will, to beſtow ſome good things in the way of his Providence? ſo as, if there be any ſpecial promiſes, there muſt be a ſpecial Providence. Now there is none ſo meanly verſed in the holy Scripture, that he is not aware of a multitude of promiſes in them, made to the people of God; promiſes that concern this life, and that alſo which is to come: the 91 <hi>Pſalm</hi> is made up of ſuch promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, <hi>The experience of all times proves it,</hi> that ſome have been preſerved, upheld, directed and governed by a Providence, in a more ſpecial manner than others have been: So that none can modeſtly deny or doubt a ſpecial Providence. The next Queſtion is,</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Who are the objects of it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is generally anſwered by Divines, that <hi>reaſonable creatures</hi> are the objects only of ſpecial Providence. Theſe are only <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men:</hi> for the Specialty of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> ſo far as they relate to <hi>Angels,</hi> as we know little of it, ſo neither doth the knowledg of it much concern us: of that therefore I ſhall ſay nothing, being not deſirous to intrude into thoſe things which man hath not ſeen. It is certain, that by the ſpecial Providence of God they are more eminently upheld, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:192227:81"/>in their ſtate of integrity, governed in their motions and actions by God, and that in a more eminent manner than other inferiour creatures: but I intend no diſcourſe of that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond object of ſpecial Providence is <hi>Man.</hi> 1. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind conſidered in the general.</hi> All men and women are under more ſpecial acts of Providence, as to <hi>Preſervation</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> than the graſs, or the beaſts, the inanimate creatures, or the brute creatures: but neither ſhall I make this the ſubject of my diſcourſe. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of man in the general, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.5, <hi>Thou haſt made him a little lower than the Angels, and haſt crowned him with glory and honour. Thou madeſt him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou haſt put all things under his foot. All ſheep and oxen; yea, and the beaſts of the field.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Secondly, The <hi>Church of God,</hi> and more eſpecially, thoſe that are the <hi>inviſible part of it,</hi> that glory not in appearance only, but in reality, and have not only a <hi>name to live,</hi> but live <hi>indeed,</hi> are the more eminent objects of ſpecial Providence. I ſay firſt,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The whole viſible Church,</hi> by which, I mean, the whole body of people, whom God, by the Preaching of the Goſpel, hath called out to an external profeſſion, and viſible owning of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, (<hi>Amos</hi> 3.2.); the whole body of that Nation circumciſed, and viſibly owning and ſerving the true God, were under more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence than all the world beſides. The Chriſtian Church is ſo. <hi>Canaan of old was the land which God cared for,</hi> and he hath a <hi>Canaan</hi> now; his whole Church which he doth care for, and for whom he exerciſeth a more ſpecial Providence, both in the preſervation and Government of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But yet the <hi>inviſible part</hi> of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> that is, that number of Profeſſors, whoſe Profeſſion is not only viſible to men, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18), but their faith, their ſincerity, their true holineſs is ſeen by God, who love and fear the great God in truth and holineſs; theſe are the moſt ſpecial objects of ſpecial Providence. Only one thing let me more add, in an anſwer to this Queſtion; that neither all <hi>mankind,</hi> not <hi>members of the Church,</hi> nor all <hi>Churches,</hi> nor all <hi>Saints</hi> are under the ſame, or equal influences of Providence; and therefore Divines have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed <hi>ſpecial Providences</hi> into thoſe which are more <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:192227:82"/>or <hi>ordinary:</hi> the former are more miraculous, or little differing from miracles: the latter are more equal and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſo will be the more the ſubject of our diſcourſe. All men are not reſtrained as <hi>Abimelech</hi> was. All <hi>Churches</hi> are not preſerved <hi>in a red Sea, a wilderneſs;</hi> have not <hi>Manna</hi> rained from heaven to feed them, nor <hi>Waters</hi> brought out of a rock to ſatisfie their thirſt, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church had. All Saints are not taken up to Heaven in a fiery Chariot as <hi>Elijah,</hi> nor preſerved in the Lions Den as <hi>Daniel,</hi> or in the fire as the <hi>three children.</hi> But there is, 1. A ſpecial Providence attends every viſible Church of Chriſt. 2. And <hi>every one who is a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi> and puts his truſt in the Lord. I come more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to ſhew you, by what more particular acts the Providence of God diſcovereth Gods ſpecial care, for his Church, and for particular Souls.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>By what more particular acts doth the Providence of God diſcover Gods ſpecial care for the viſible Church, and for particular believing ſouls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Church of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He preſerveth it ſo as it ſhall never periſh.</hi> You know the promiſe: <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> Matt. 16.18. God preſerveth the individual Being of every particular man, <hi>He holdeth our ſouls in life,</hi> but yet his being ſhall fail: there will come a time when he ſhall not be. <hi>Our Prophets are gone, our fathers where are they?</hi> God preſerveth the Beings of <hi>Polities,</hi> the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires</hi> of the World; but theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have their periods: where are the great Empires of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp;c? He ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth his Church, that it ſhall never fail; this is a <hi>Specialty of Providence.</hi> Men ſhall dye, <hi>Kingdomes</hi> ſhall dye, <hi>Empires</hi> ſhall come to nothing: the <hi>Church ſhall not dye.</hi> This <hi>woman</hi> may <hi>flee into the Wilderneſs</hi> from the <hi>red dragon,</hi> (as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>Where ſhe hath a place prepared of God;</hi> but there ſhe ſhall <hi>be fed</hi> 1260 <hi>days:</hi> the <hi>earth</hi> ſhall <hi>help the woman,</hi> Rev. 12.16. Chriſt will be with them to the end of the world: God ſo preſervetth, no creatures, no Polities, no Societies of men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A <hi>ſecond ſpecialty of Providence</hi> relating to the Church, ſeems to be a ſpecial <hi>Miniſtry of Angels,</hi> Heb. 2.14, <hi>Are they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:192227:82"/>not all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who are heirs of ſalvation?</hi> Who are thoſe that are heirs of ſalvation, but the Church of God? <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47, <hi>And the Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.10, <hi>The woman ought to have power over her head</hi> (or a covering over head) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Angels.</hi> There have been many Divines, who have thought that in the Government of Providence, ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Angels have the charge of particular Kingdoms, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and Churches. You read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.12, <hi>The Prince of the Kingdom of Perſia withſtood me twenty one days: but lo, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael one of the chief Princes came to help me:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 21, <hi>There is none that holdeth with me in theſe things, but Michael your Prince.</hi> There are ſome alſo that interpret thus; The <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches mentioned in the <hi>Revelation</hi> (but moſt interpret them of the Paſtors over them): but certain it is, the Angels (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one more ſpecially or no) have a ſpecial Miniſtry towards the Church of Chriſt. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.11, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.</hi> I ſhall not enlarge upon this: for though this ſeemeth to be plainly enough in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture revealed, yet the particulars of their Miniſtration are not ſo clearly revealed, as we can aſſert much diſtincty concerning them. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1, <hi>At that time</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>ſhall Michael ſtand up, the great Prince, which ſtandeth for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thy people.</hi> The Angels ſtand up for the Church; that is a Specialty of Providence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>All Gods extraordinary acts in the Government of his Creatures have been for his Church.</hi> It was in revenge of their oppreſſions, that God ſends ten plagues one after another upon <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> it is for them he ſuſpendeth the Laws of Nature, for them the waters of the Red-ſea, then the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> divide: for them it was that the Sun ſtood ſtill in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and the Moon in the Valley of <hi>Ajalon,</hi> in the time of <hi>Joſhuah;</hi> That the <hi>earth opened,</hi> Numb. 16, and ſwallowed up <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram:</hi> It is for his Church that natural Beings have acted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their ordinary capacities: Hail-ſtones are made ſo big, as falling down upon their Enemies-heads, they killed more than his peoples ſwords. At the ſound of Rams-horns, the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fall down. It is for this people that the clouds rain down bread, and the Rock guſheth out water. There was no people, that God ſo <hi>aſſayed to take from the midſt of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:192227:83"/>by temptations, by ſigns and wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a ſtretched out arm, and by great terrors,</hi> Deut. 4.34: and although God hath not been ſo ſeen in mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous operations for his Goſpel-Church: yet how often hath one chaſed ten, ten an hundred, an hundred a thouſand, and a thouſand put ten thouſand to flight? There have been no ſuch inſtances in the World of the Providence of God, working for the ſalvation and deliverance of Heathens, as of that body of his people, which are his Church: or of Gods workings in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous manner for the preſervation of others, as of that his <hi>little flock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But 4thly, It is a great <hi>ſpecialty of Providence,</hi> that unto this people are <hi>committed the Oracles of God;</hi> they are the only people which have <hi>the ordinary means of ſalvation.</hi> This is that <hi>Much advantage every way</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) which the <hi>Jews</hi> had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2: <hi>beeauſe unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> It hath been a queſtion, <hi>Whether God giveth unto all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means for ſalvation.</hi> Some affirm it, others with better reaſon deny it; at length ſome of the Patrons for it, are forced to yield, That none but the <hi>Church hath ſufficient means. In Judah is God known:</hi> in the Church Chriſt is preached; the glad tidings of ſalvation are publiſhed; the Heathens have only the light of Nature, a light ſufficient (if not walked up to) to make them inexcuſable, but by no means ſufficient to direct men to Heaven: it ſheweth men nothing of Chriſt, and there is no other Name under Heaven but the Name <hi>of Jeſus by which we can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, neither is there ſalvation in any other.</hi> Chriſt is only ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily preached in the Church of God. This is a great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, a great Specialty of Providence towards the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>But yet, <hi>There is a more ſpecial Providence attends the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the inviſible Church, particular Saints,</hi> and that is plain from the <hi>Promiſes of God in Scripture.</hi> There are indeed many Promiſes which concern the whole viſible Church; but the moſt of the Promiſes are made unto Godlineſs: the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8, that <hi>hath great promiſes</hi> both of <hi>this life,</hi> and <hi>a life to come:</hi> and as the great variety of Promiſes evinceth a <hi>ſpecial providence</hi> in the preſervation and government of them; ſo alſo Gods Diſpenſations upon thoſe Promiſes do abundantly evince it: but let me open it in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:192227:83"/>1. <hi>It is for them that God ordinarily goeth out of the common road of his Providence for their preſervation:</hi> Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Lions Den; <hi>The three Children</hi> in the fiery Furnace; <hi>Moſes</hi> in a little ark of Bul-ruſhes; <hi>Noah,</hi> when the whole World was ſwallowed up in a Deluge of waters: they are thoſe that dwell in the ſecret place of the moſt High, that ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty; theſe he delivereth from the ſnare of the Fowler, and from the noiſom Peſtilence; and to whom all the Promiſes are made, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91. I do not ſay, but others may ſometimes meet with ſtrange and miraculous preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, but the inſtances of them are rarer. The Promiſes are not made to them, they can expect no ſuch thing, and uſually it is for the ſake of ſuch as fear God: indeed theſe Providences are not the portion of all the children of God. God will have us know that theſe are not <hi>the good things which he hath prepared for them that love him:</hi> though the power and goodneſs of God ſhall be thus declared for ſome of them, yet it ſhall not be ſo for all, that we may not think them the Believers portion; but <hi>things</hi> which God addeth unto them, who are the heirs of ſalvation, and ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs thereof.</p>

Theſe are thoſe, whom <hi>God gives ſpecial warnings to of evils to come, and whom he prompts to hide themſelves.</hi> What ſaith <hi>God? ſhall I hide from Abraham, the thing I intend to do to Sodom? Noah being warned of God, prepared an Ark</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle); you know what a warning <hi>Lot</hi> had of the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Sodom.</hi> They tell us of a Voice which the godly <hi>Jews</hi> heard a little before the fatal deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem, Ite Pellam,</hi> Go away to <hi>Pella.</hi> It is true, thoſe extraordinary warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are much now ceaſed; but <hi>the Providence vf</hi> God yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.

                  <p n="4">4. For theſe (fourthly it is) that <hi>God commandeth the ſenſitive creatures that they ſhall not hurt them, that they ſhall ſerve them:</hi> the Lions ſhall not hurt <hi>Daniel;</hi> it is to them the Promiſe is made. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.13, <hi>Thou ſhalt tread upon the Lion, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the Dragon ſhalt thou trample under thy feet.</hi> It is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſtory of that Proteſtant in the <hi>Pariſian maſſacre,</hi> that was ſaved by a <hi>Spider,</hi> that had woven a web before the entrance of a hole, in which he hid himſelf from the murtherers that ſought his life; which made them conclude, that he was not there.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For theſe it is, that <hi>he bridleth the rage of wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men:</hi> The Providence of God (if I may ſay ſo) hath its hardeſt task with wicked men.

For theſe it is, that <hi>he over-ruleth the moſt malitious actions of men: Surely</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>) <hi>the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee; and the remainder of wrath thou ſhalt reſtrain: Hamans</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice ſhall iſſue in the exaltation of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and the further eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the <hi>Jews.

But, as I ſaid before concerning theſe matters which relate to this life, though the people of God can only claim a right in theſe Promiſes, and be thoſe to whom they generally are fulfilled, not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: yet you muſt not be miſtaken to think, that all the people of God ſhall have them made good to them. God as to theſe Diſpenſations, dealing out (as in other things of outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence)
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:192227:84"/>according to his own good pleaſure; regulated by his infinite Wiſdom, working for the glory of his holy Name, and for the good of his people.</p>
                  <p n="7">7thly, There is a ſpecial Providence of God extended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all thoſe that truly fear and love God. <hi>In the giving to them the things that accompany ſalvation, and preſerving and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding in them thoſe habits of grace; by the operations of which, they are made fit for the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> Grace is the only creature of God, which God preſerveth that it ſhall not die; but yet it is preſerved alive by the power of God. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural habits</hi> may periſh; <hi>Moral habits</hi> may be extinguiſhed; <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious habits</hi> are the ſeed of God, which do not die: <hi>he ſhall be hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up, for God is able to make him to ſtand,</hi> Rom. 14.4. Now this is a piece of Providence common to all the Saints, and <hi>ſpecial</hi> and peculiar to them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8thly, The ſpecial Providence of God to his people, is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſeen in this, <hi>That all things work together for their good:</hi> You know the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28, <hi>And we know that all things work together for the good of them that love God, who are called accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his purpoſe.</hi> There is another Text much of the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, poſſibly of a larger extent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, <hi>All-things are yours: whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the World, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come: all are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> The former Text chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects <hi>ſufferings:</hi> the ſufferings and afflictions of Gods people are for their good. The latter reſpecteth <hi>Ordinances,</hi> but both of them have the univerſal particle <hi>All: All things are yours; All things work together for good:</hi> and whether either of thoſe Texts reſpect ſins or no (which indeed are hardly to be counted into the number of <hi>things</hi>) I will not ſay; yet moſt certain it is, that by the over-rulings of Divine Providence, even the ſins of Gods people work together for their good. <hi>What fear</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle), What <hi>ſorrow?</hi> what <hi>jealouſie,</hi> what <hi>revenge</hi> do they work? How low do they make the child of God in his own Eyes? How do they contribute to a poor, broken and contrite ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in him? What care and watchfulneſs do they produce in him for the time to come? It is the miſery of a wicked man, all things work together for his hurt: if he hath Riches, Honour, worldly enjoyments, or croſſes, trials, afflictions, <hi>all things are againſt him.</hi> God gives the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> rebelling and murmuring,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:192227:85"/>
                     <hi>Quales in his wrath,</hi> and a King <hi>in his wrath;</hi> and God gives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Riches,</hi> honours, wives, children, all in his wrath; all things are againſt them: but now if a man be a child of God, all things are his; all things are for him, for his good and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, (which indeed ſhould have been mentioned firſt), <hi>God</hi> giveth his <hi>good Angels charge concerning them:</hi> The good Angels have not only a Miniſtry to the Church, which I touched before, but they have a Miniſtry as to every individual Believer. It is a Promiſe made, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.11, to every one: <hi>who, ver.</hi> 1. <hi>dwelleth in the ſecret of the moſt High; He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways: they ſhall bear thee up in their hands, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14, <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation?</hi> and therefore they are called <hi>Their Angels.</hi> Matth. 18.10, <hi>Take heed that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not one of theſe little ones: for I ſay unto you that in Heaven, their Angels always behold the face of my father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> It hath been the opinion of ſome, and thoſe very eminent Divines, That every child of God hath his <hi>particular Angel,</hi> uſually called his <hi>Tutelar Angel,</hi> or Angel-guardian. They have builded this Notion upon thoſe probable Texts, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.23: where the Chriſtians met, told the Maid concerning <hi>Peter, It is his Angel.</hi> Gen. 48.16, where <hi>Jacob</hi> prays, That <hi>the Angel</hi> who had redeemed <hi>him from all evil would bleſs the lads, Joſephs</hi> children: and <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10. I ſhall not meddle with that nice Queſtion; thoſe who deſire to read what is to be read for it, or what may be ſaid, may find it in Mr. <hi>Dingles</hi> judicious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>Deputation of Angels:</hi> certain it is, that the Angels have a ſpecial Miniſtry with reference to the heirs of ſalvation: certain it is, that <hi>they ſhall bear them up in their hands</hi> (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith) that they <hi>ſhall not daſh their feet againſt a ſtone: that they ſhall keep them in all their ways.</hi> What power they have <hi>to make impreſſions upon their minds,</hi> I cannot determine; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it is, that as <hi>evil angels</hi> have a power to <hi>tempt</hi> and ſollicit to evil: ſo the <hi>good Angels</hi> do often move, and ſollicit (by way of ſecret impreſſions) the ſouls of the Saints to that which is good. Certain it is, this is a Specialty of Divine Providence with reference to the Saints; therefore our Saviour calleth them, <hi>their Angels.</hi> The Angels pull'd <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 19.16:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:192227:85"/>they appeared to <hi>Jacob</hi> in his journey to <hi>Padan aram,</hi> Gen. 28.12: they met him again at <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> Gen. 32.1, 2. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> telleth us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 34.7, <hi>They encamp about him that feareth the Lord.</hi> An Angel attends <hi>Elias,</hi> moveth him to eat, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.7; appeared for <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.17. In ſhort, much is ſpoken in Scripture concerning the Miniſtry of Angels, for the good of the people of God; though much alſo of their Miniſtration be, doubtleſs, unknown to us: <hi>Scriptura piis tantum Angelorum cuſtodiam, &amp; miniſterium tribuit, impiis non item</hi> (ſaith a grave Author). But I ſhall add no more to the Explicatory part of this Diſcourſe, having touched moſt of the Specialties of Divine Providence; with reference both to the Church, and to particular believing Souls. If any thing be further needful for the proof of this: what need we do any more, than take a view of the Church of God in the ſeveral periods of it, and of the number of ſincere and pious Souls in any age of the World? The <hi>Church of God</hi> from the beginning hath been either <hi>Jewiſh, or Chriſtian.</hi> For the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church he that runneth may read it in the whole ſtory of the Old Teſtament; <hi>Moſes</hi> makes a large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 3, and <hi>ch.</hi> 4; and the very bent of his Diſcourſe is to ſhew the eminent ſpecial Providences of God for them, above all other people and Nations upon the Earth. In ſhort, the whole ſtory of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church after <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, until Chriſts coming, is all but an eminent proof of this Doctrine. After Chriſts coming and aſcenſion, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church was formed, encompaſſed with Enemies on all hands; the <hi>Jews</hi> on one hand, the <hi>Heathens</hi> on the other. The <hi>Jews</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er indeed was not much: they were at firſt under the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in a few years utterly deſtroyed by them; but the <hi>Heathens</hi> over-ſpread the World. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was then in its glory; They were full of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>learned men,</hi> to whom the Goſpel appear'd no better than fooliſhneſs; They were eſtabliſhed and rooted in Idolatry, and very jealous of their Religion. The <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> began with twelve men, moſt of them <hi>Fiſhermen:</hi> one indeed (a learned man) <hi>Paul</hi> was afterwards added to them: What think you, muſt there not a great deal of <hi>ſpecial Providence</hi> be ſhewed to preſerve this little flock? theſe few men ſent out to, plant the Goſpel over all the World; that they ſhould go, and in deſpight both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſpread the Goſpel over all the World. It is true, there
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:192227:86"/>were great perſecutions, great havock made by the Enemies of the Church amongſt them for three hundred years; but this ſtill evidenceth the more ſpecial Providence of God, watching over them, working with them; that though they did what they could to blow out this light, and had all the power in the World on their ſide; yet neither the Philoſophers, and Orators of the World, with their <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> could argue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World from this New Doctrine; nor all the force and rage they could uſe, could fright the World from it, nor root it out of the World; neither deſtroy all the Miniſters, nor root out all the profeſſors, but a number ſhould be left in all places: and after three hundred years, an Emperour ſhould ariſe that ſhould eſtabliſh the Chriſtian Religion, and make it obtain in all places. It is true, after this the Chriſtian Church degenerated, admitted foul Hereſies, Idolatry and Superſtition; and it became with the Chriſtian Church, as it was with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in the days of <hi>Elijah,</hi> Prophets were hid in caves; <hi>Elija</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he was left alone; yet God had his <hi>ſeven thouſand in Iſrael that had not bowed the knee to Baal: nor kiſſed him with their lips.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſm had ſo prevailed in the Chriſtian Church; that the ſincere and true Profeſſors were few. A <hi>few in the valleys of Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> A few in <hi>Germany,</hi> who ſtuck to the truth: did it not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a great and ſpecial Providence of God to watch over <hi>theſe</hi> few, keeping them, that they were not ſwallowed up by their numerous adverſaries? <hi>Luther</hi> began the Reformation in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and began it almoſt alone: One poor man againſt all the power of <hi>Rome:</hi> God preſerved him alive, proſpered his works in his hands. Indeed this Doctrine of ſpecial Providence need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no other proof, than what might be afforded it from the ſtory of that great man; who conſidering what he did, and with what an undaunted ſpirit and courage he did it, lived al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day by a Miracle, and yet went down to the grave in peace in a good old age, <hi>like a ſhock of corn in its ſeaſon</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh). For particular inſtances of the ſpecial Providence of God towards particular Saints; the time would fail me to tell you the particular ſtories of <hi>Abraham. Jacob, Joſeph, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, David:</hi> and there is hardly any child of God living, but will find it in the records of his own life, that hath been <hi>preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> more than other men. There is no truth more wrote with a Sun-beam, than this great truth of Special Providence is.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:192227:86"/>
                  <p>Now if any man ask me the reaſon of it, it is enough to ſay, <hi>So it pleaſed God.</hi> God is free in theſe, as in other of his diſpenſations: but yet let me ſhew you the reaſonableneſs of theſe more particular and ſpecial Providences.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It hath been an old Obſervation, That <hi>Gods Providence is moſt eminently exerciſed about the nobleſt of his Creatures, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> and <hi>Men:</hi> but I know not how to make this Notion out. The Angels are more noble creatures than men, ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of vaſter capacities; according to this obſervation they ſhould be the more the objects of ſpecial Providence: but I ſay, I doubt this. I am ſure there was one great act of <hi>ſpecial Providence,</hi> in which the Angels were not concerned: Chriſt did not take upon him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Secondly, Of the whole Creation <hi>Angels</hi> and Men are thoſe creatures, whom in Creation he was pleaſed moſt to fit, and capacitate for the great ends of his glory, for an active, deſigned, glorifying of his holy name. Let me open this a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The great end of all the actions of God, is his own glory.</hi> The wiſe man tells us, <hi>That the Lord made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Prov. 16.4. Indeed, if we wiſely conſider the thing, it muſt be ſo; every rational agent worketh for ſome end, and his reaſonable nature conſtraineth him to work <hi>for the beſt end.</hi> God is the higheſt reaſonable agent; and as he can do nothing in vain, but for ſome end, ſo he cannot but act for a <hi>good end,</hi> and for the <hi>beſt end.</hi> Now this could be no other than himſelf, his own honour and glory: ſo that as the Apoſtle ſaith of Gods ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>becauſe he could ſwear by no greater, he ſware by himſelf:</hi> ſo we muſt <hi>ſay of Gods working;</hi> becauſe he could work for no better, no higher end than his own glory, therefore he wrought for himſelf: whatſoever he did he did for his own honour and glory. Now (as I have ſaid before),</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we diligently conſider it, God cannot be otherwiſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by his Creatures, than <hi>by their praedication and publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his honour and glory.</hi> The eſſential glory of God is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther capable of augmentation, nor of diminution; no creature can add any thing unto that. Now look,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As <hi>a man may be honoured mutely,</hi> or more <hi>livelily;</hi> ſo may God. For example. A Limner draweth a curious piece,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:192227:87"/>which is expoſed to view; he gets a great deal of honour, credit and repute by it: the Picture is a dead mute thing, and hath no <hi>voice</hi> to praiſe its maker by, nor any underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or will to praiſe him from any intention, and deſign, and choice; yet it honoureth him: the Workmanſhip and Art of it gives the Limner a repute to all that view it. We will now ſuppoſe this Limner to have two Sons, both excellently bred up in Arts and Sciences, &amp;c. but the one a rude debaucht fellow, rebellious to his father, yet a man of parts; and as he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his breeding and education upon any ſubject, he honoureth his Father. But the other <hi>Son is dutiful, loves his Parent,</hi> makes it his buſineſs to commend him to all: you will ſay, That this Limner, though he receiveth ſome honour from his mute and dead Picture, and ſome honour from his rude and rebellious Son, yet the dutiful Son is he who bringeth moſt honour and repute to the Father. This is the caſe betwixt God and his Creatures; God hath made the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>Stars,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Seas;</hi> the Whales, the Lions, and Elephants, the Eagles, the little Silk-worms: all theſe are pieces of the Divine Workmanſhip, all give honour and glory to God; but it is done mutely and paſſively. <hi>The vile and wicked men of the world,</hi> that are <hi>rebels againſt God,</hi> yet give a glory to God. The ſtructure of their bodies, the endowments of their minds, honour God, who made them, and gave them thoſe excellent features, qualities and endowments. God uſeth them (ſome of their vile and malitious actions) to bring about his wiſe and glorious ends; but God doth but, as it were, extort his glory from them: But now, <hi>the people of God,</hi> out of choice, and deſign, and by a voluntary act and conſtant ſtudy give honour and glory to him. Obedience is better than ſacrifice; doing of his will is more acceptable to him than burnt-offerings. The glory God hath in Heaven from Angels, and the Souls of juſt men made perfect, is from their <hi>voluntary</hi> praiſing of him, and doing of his will: therefore we pray, <hi>Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven.</hi> Now I pray obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Angels and men are the only creatures capable of an active, voluntary, deſigned, glorifying of God:</hi> The Heavens, and in them the Sun, the Moon, the Stars glorifie God, but they know it not; they are inanimate creatures, not capable of knowledg. The brute creatures act not from any principle
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:192227:87"/>of reaſon, they have no rational nature; and though God hath glory from them, yet it is not from any principle within them: ſo that Angels and Men being rational Beings, have a further capacity to ſerve the Lords great end in bringing glory to God, than all the Inanimate Creatures; yea, than all the vegetative or ſenſitive Creatures in the World.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Amongſt men, <hi>The whole Church of God in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is that body of people, where there is any voluntary glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God: Pſal.</hi> 29.9, <hi>In his temple doth every one ſpeak of his glory.</hi> The whole viſible Church bringeth <hi>an active glory to God:</hi> it is the <hi>Pillar</hi> upon which his <hi>Proclamations</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> are hung forth to the view of the World: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.1, <hi>His name is great in Iſrael.</hi> In the Church, whether in truth or in ſincerity, all men glorifie God by a profeſſed ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Ordinances, and an outward owning of him.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, But Laſtly, God is moſt <hi>eminently glorified by his Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. They do it moſt <hi>heartily, ſteadily,</hi> and <hi>fully.</hi> What hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites do they do in a meer ſhew and outward appearance. As they <hi>glory in appearance,</hi> ſo they <hi>glorifie God</hi> but in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, from the teeth outward, as we ſay; there is nothing of heart, deſign, and choice in it: they indeed glorifie God, but we may ſay of their honouring and glorifying of God, as the Prophet ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.7, of <hi>Aſſyria's</hi> ſerving God, <hi>Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo;</hi> but it is the godly mans choice, deſign, ſtudy, and he doth it more <hi>ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> the hypocrite is <hi>in</hi> and <hi>out;</hi> he glorifieth God one hour, by confeſſing his ſins, putting up prayers to him, reading his word, ſinging his praiſe, and ſpits in the face of God the next hour, by <hi>ſwearing,</hi> and <hi>curſing,</hi> and <hi>blaſpheming,</hi> by drunkenneſs and diſobedience; and the godly man glorifieth God <hi>moſt fully:</hi> the hypocrites action is but the action of his <hi>outward man;</hi> he doth not glorifie God as the godly man doth in <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Godly men glorifie God <hi>ſincerely:</hi> ſo do no hypocrites, no <hi>formal profeſſors.</hi> All hypocrites aim at themſelves, they do what they do, (as our Saviour ſaid of the <hi>Phariſees),</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to be ſeen of men: the godly man driveth no ſuch deſigns, nor hath a ſquint-eye in his actions, which appear to be directed to the glory of God: the glory of God is the firſt, the main of his deſign.</p>

                  <p>Now the <hi>glory of God,</hi> being the great end to which he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the general and particular acts, both of his preſerving, and of his Governing-Providence; it from hence appeareth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding reaſonable, that <hi>Providence</hi> ſhould work both in <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving</hi> and in governing the world by theſe different degrees, and with theſe Specialties which I have ſhewed you. God is more glorified by men, than either by inanimate creatures, or by any vegetative or ſenſitive creatures. More by that body of men called his Church, than by Heathens amongſt whom his name is not known. More yet by godly men, whom he hath ſet apart for himſelf, and who ſteadily, deſignedly, heartily, ſincerely ſet themſelves to purſue the great deſign of his glory, than by any hypocrites and formal profeſſors: therefore it is but reaſonable, they ſhould in their degrees be cared for, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and governed by God in a more ſpecial and eminent manner. But I ſhall add no more to the Doctrinal part of this diſcourſe. The Application ſtill remains for the ſubject of further diſcourſe.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Am come now to the Application of my former Diſcourſe. You have heard that God doth not only exerciſe ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral acts of Providence in the <hi>preſervation</hi> and <hi>government of all his creatures,</hi> but ſome ſpecial acts of Providence, in the preſervation and government of ſome creatures in a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and eminent manner. Though God doth take a care for <hi>Oxen,</hi> yet he doth not take <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>care</hi> for <hi>Oxen</hi> as he doth for <hi>Angels,</hi> for <hi>men,</hi> and amongſt the children of men, particularly for <hi>the members of his Church, and amongſt them for ſuch as are not ſo only in an external viſible profeſſion, but in truth and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> they are under the higheſt Specialties and care of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. The Doctrine of Gods Special Providence concerning Angels, and mankind in the general, and the <hi>Polities</hi> and Societies of men, I much paſſed over. The former being much a ſecret to us, and not much concerning us: and my Diſcourſe being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Heathens, but to a Congregation, which univerſally is within the pale of the <hi>viſible Church.</hi> I therefore moſt enlarged upon the Specialties of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> (as you know) with reference to the <hi>Church of God, and thoſe in it who truly fear God;</hi> accordingly I ſhall ſute my Application.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Let this <hi>inſtruct all that hear me this day</hi> in the <hi>Reaſon, That God hath this day a Church in the world:</hi> and alſo confirm <hi>them, that notwithſtanding all the appearances of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:192227:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>againſt it, yet God will have a Church to the end of the world.</hi> Whoſo conſidereth the Church of God this day, eſpecially the <hi>Reformed Church,</hi> and looks back upon it, even from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of its Reformation, cannot but fancy it, as <hi>Noahs Ark in the midſt of raging waters, every moment threatning to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it up;</hi> like <hi>Moſes</hi> his ark of Bulruſhes, ready to be waſhed away at the return of every tide; like the <hi>Burning buſh</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw all <hi>on fire,</hi> yet <hi>not conſumed.</hi> You ſhall find the Reaſon why it is not ſo in the 46 <hi>Pſalm</hi> (a <hi>Pſalm</hi> which <hi>Luther</hi> was wont often to call for in his troubleſom time); <hi>God is our refuge and ſtrength, a preſent help in trouble,</hi> Ver. 5, <hi>God is in the midſt of her:</hi> The Lord of Hoſts is with <hi>her; the God of Jacob is our refuge: he breaketh the bow, he cutteth the ſpear in ſunder; he burneth the chariots in the fire.</hi> Papiſts call for <hi>Miracles,</hi> as a Note of the true Church; ſee here a Miracle: Was it not a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that <hi>Luther,</hi> a poor <hi>Friar,</hi> renouncing his former Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bidding an open defiance to the <hi>Pope</hi> and the whole power of <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſuch a time when all the World was admiring, or fearing the Beaſt, and ſo boldly and freely oppoſing himſelf to them, as he did, and falling upon them in a point of profit, ſhould not only go through all his bold attempts, and die in peace; but alſo draw unto him ſo many learned men, and prevail ſo far amongſt the people, as that in very many, if not in moſt parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Doctrine of the Goſpel ſhould prevail, the <hi>Maſs</hi> and <hi>Popiſh worſhip</hi> ſhould be aboliſhed, and the Truth contrary to the Doctrine of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be received? Was there not a ſpecial Providence (think you) watched over them? Next to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Apoſtles, and the ſucceeding of them to the firſt plantation of the Goſpel in the World, there hath not been a more eminent and conſpicuous work of ſpecial and miraculous Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than in Gods preſerving and ſucceeding the works of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; by which the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſt, and Worſhip inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by him, was reſtored in a great meaſure to that Primitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and purity, which the great Lord of the Goſpel firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. And a due meditation of this Doctrine of <hi>ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, may alſo ſecure the hearts of the people of God againſt their fears, for the prevailing of the Churches enemies againſt it.</hi> Their fears can ariſe but from the proſpect of the multitude, and rage of the Churches enemies: and their judgment is but a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>probability,</hi> made from the more common and ordinary
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:192227:89"/>workings of Providence: but this judgment proceeds upon a falſe Hypotheſis, <hi>viz. That Gods way of Providence as to his Church,</hi> is but an ordinary road, and ſuch as he <hi>keepeth towards other men.</hi> Now this is falſe; God in his workings for his Church, keepeth not the beaten road of his Providence. <hi>Zion</hi> hath a ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, watching over it: <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon it from one end of the year to the other. Canaan</hi> is the Land that God careth for; <hi>God is known in the places of his Church for a refuge; For lo the Kings were aſſembled, they paſſed by together; they ſaw it, and ſo they marvelled, they were troubled and haſted away: Fear took hold upon them there, and pain as on a woman in travel.</hi> Pſalm 48.3, 4, 5, 6, <hi>God will eſtabliſh it for ever.</hi> Ver. 8, <hi>Watch about Sion</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt) and go round about her; tell the towers thereof: mark you well her bulwarks, conſider her palaces, that you may tell it to the generations following: for this God is our God for ever, and ever: he will be our guide until death.</hi> We have lived to ſee as bold and impudent attaques made upon the Church, as to that part of it that hath been ſtudious of the ſtricter and ſeverer practice of Holineſs, as poſſibly later ages have known. If Chriſtians could have been ſwagger'd and hector'd out of the practice of Holineſs, or <hi>jeer'd</hi> and <hi>drolled</hi> out of it; or threatned and frighted, or cudgel'd out of it, there have been arguments enough of this nature uſed: but how little have they done? how few are leſs in love with the good, and holy ways of God than before? Having therefore ſo many great and precious Promiſes for the preſervation of the Church, and God exerciſing a ſpecial care for it, and keeping it under a ſpecial tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telage; Let us not fear, but believe that <hi>God</hi> (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith) <hi>will eſtabliſh it for ever.</hi> Let us therefore look off <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-appearances</hi> and <hi>humane-probabilities.</hi> The Church is a <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-buſh,</hi> and hath been ſo from the very firſt plantation of it: but we ſee it is not conſumed, becauſe God is in the midſt of it. Remember this, That the Church liveth not upon an ordinary, common, general Providence, but upon a <hi>ſpecial peculiar Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> watching over it, and caring for it.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, this may ſerve to ſhew you your duty: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to obſerve <hi>the ſpecial Providences that attend your lives.</hi> There is an <hi>obſervation</hi> of the more <hi>general Providence</hi> of God in <hi>upholding</hi> and <hi>governing the World;</hi> which is our duty, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:192227:90"/>ſweet and advantageous piece of duty; (but this I ſhall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter further preſs upon you). That which I would ſpeak a few words to here, is the obſervation of the <hi>ſpecial Providence</hi> of God <hi>relating to you.</hi> What the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith of the obſervations of Providence more generally, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 107, the laſt verſe; <hi>Whoſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth theſe things is wiſe, and he ſhall underſtand the loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord,</hi> is eminently true. Here it ſpeaks, 1. <hi>A Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wiſdom.</hi> 2. <hi>It will be of great uſe to make us underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> Obſerve the <hi>ſpecial Providences</hi> of God towards his Church; his Church in former ages, his Church in our preſent age: you will by thoſe obſervations be able to make up a judgment what man is like to do againſt it; and what God is like yet to do for that body of people that come under that Notion: nay, you will be able to go a great way in making up a Judgment, who they are that make up the true Church of God; even thoſe upon whom the Eye of God is moſt, and for whom his Arm is moſt ſtretched out; not in this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular act, but in a continued ſeries and courſe of ſtrange preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. There is, and indeed always hath been a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the World, which is the true Church of God. The <hi>Jews</hi> arrogated the honour to themſelves; and indeed there was a time when none could claim with them: but the Apoſtle am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply declareth their <hi>rejection,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ingraffing. But though it be certain now, that the <hi>Church of God</hi> is made up of thoſe that were <hi>Gentiles;</hi> yet as ſeveral Sects and parties have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen up amongſt them, ſo they have had an ambition ſtill to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate this Name to themſelves. The <hi>Arians</hi> would be the only Church; ſince that, the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> think they have the beſt claim, and great diſputes there are for this <hi>Honourable Title.</hi> I will not ſay this will determine the cauſe, but it will go a great way. That body of people profeſſing Chriſt, againſt whom <hi>the gates of Hell cannot prevail,</hi> Matth. 16.18. In the midſt of which God appears to be by a more ſpecial powerful Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, keeping it that it ſhall not fall. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 46.5, <hi>That people which the Lord keepeth and watereth every moment, leſt any ſhould hurt it, keeping it night and day,</hi> Iſa. 27.3. That people <hi>round about whom the Lord is as the mountains are round about Jeruſalem.</hi> Pſalm 125, <hi>v.</hi> 2, Who can ſay, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 124, <hi>If it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide: If it had not been the Lord, who was on our ſide: when men roſe up againſt us, then they had ſwallowed us
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:192227:90"/>up quick, when their wrath was kindled againſt us: Then the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had over-whelmed us, the proud waters had gone over our ſouls.</hi> I ſay, that people amongſt thoſe that lay claim to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Title of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> ſeem to have the beſt claim; for it is the Church for which God exerciſeth a <hi>ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> I will not ſay, This alone will prove any party the true Chriſtian Church; but where-ever we ſee a people profeſſing faith in Jeſus Chriſt, holding the Doctrine of the Goſpel; cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi> for the trial of her <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and God watching over this people, ſtrangely preſerving, multiplying and encreaſing them; uſing the miniſtry of his Word amongſt them, to convert and build up Souls, delivering them in a conſtant ſeries and ſucceſſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence from their Enemies, far more and more mighty than they are, we may join our ſelves to them: The anointed of the Lord, the Church of the true and living God is doubtleſs before us. Though theſe <hi>ſpecial Providences</hi> will not make an argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, yet they are a far better argument than the <hi>Popiſh pedegree</hi> they pretend to in a ſucceſſion from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or their <hi>pretended <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> or <hi>Miracles,</hi> indeed rather to be called <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders.</hi> I know no promiſes of theſe things to the Church to the end of the World; but I know many promiſes for <hi>ſpecial Providence</hi> attending them. And certainly, that Body of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people called <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> I mean, that people in all the parts of the World, that are now called by that name (for the name beareth date but from the <hi>German Reformation):</hi> but I ſay, that Body of people united in their <hi>Doctrine and Worſhip,</hi> can lay the faireſt claim to this of any others. No people hath been more ſtrangely preſerved than they: witneſs thoſe in the valleys of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> and <hi>Lucerne,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia;</hi> none more ſtrangely preſerved, nor whoſe number hath been more ſtrangely encreaſed, nor their Doctrines more ſtrangely prevailed. A Chriſtian by obſerving which way <hi>ſpecial Providence</hi> hath moſt moved, may get much wiſdom, and much help himſelf in making a judgment <hi>which is the true Church.</hi> 2. Yea, and he <hi>may alſo much help himſelf in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe in the World, who are the true Saints and people of God;</hi> who they are that <hi>dwell in the ſecret of the moſt High,</hi> as the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> ſpeaketh; for they generally <hi>abide under the</hi> more <hi>particular ſhadow of the Almighty.</hi> It is true, there are ſome rare inſtances of perſons that walk cloſe with God, whom yet God followeth
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:192227:91"/>with a ſeries of <hi>ſevere Providences;</hi> ſuch an inſtance was <hi>Job,</hi> and ſuch particular inſtances we ſee in our time, to let us know, that outward proſperity is not the Saints portion: God hath provided ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things for his people. But take now any conſiderable number of people in any City or Place, that (ſo far as we can judg) walk more cloſe with God, and in a more ſtrict obſervation of his law than others do; and oppoſe theſe to a like number of perſons in that place, that give a liberty to their luſts, and walk by no ſuch rule: and obſerve number for number, who are moſt under the ſpecial Providence of God, preſerving them from dangers and in dangers; who are moſt bleſſed with ſpecial Providences, as to length of life, health, &amp;c. you will remember, that I told you, we muſt abate for particular inſtances of Gods own people, whom he picks out, to make examples of ſaith and patience, and to be his witneſſes unto the world in a time of trial. Who obſerveth not how ſtrangely God preſerveth and bleſſeth ſome people that fear him, and walk cloſely with him? and I do believe the obſervation will juſtifie it ſelf, concerning any conſiderable number of ſuch perſons compared with a like number of others. So that although none can conclude himſelf, or herſelf, a child of God, from ſome particular ſpecial Providence, no not from a ſeries and courſe of them; yet where men and women walk cloſe with God, Gods <hi>ſpecial Providences</hi> attending them, will much evidence, even to others, that they are not hypocritical in their profeſſions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, The obſervation of Gods <hi>ſpecial Providences</hi> towards our <hi>perſons,</hi> our <hi>families,</hi> our <hi>Church,</hi> will much make us to underſtand the <hi>loving-kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> The love of our friend to us is not ſeen ſo much in ſome acts of his goodneſs, which others experience as much as we, as in ſome <hi>ſpecial things,</hi> which he doth for us, and doth not, or will not do for others. The obſervation therefore of <hi>ſpecial Providence</hi> helps much to affect our hearts with the love of God. God in trying our love to him ſaith to us, <hi>What do you do more than others?</hi> and as our love to God is ſo tried, ſo Gods love to us is ſo <hi>evidenced:</hi> this is that which hath always ſet the hearts of the people of God admiring God. This was that which ſet the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> upon admiring Gods goodneſs to mankind, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4, <hi>What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the Son of man that thou ſhouldeſt remember him?</hi> If you read on, you will ſee, that which affected the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> was Gods <hi>ſpecial Providences</hi> to man, making him little lower than the Angels, cloathing him with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:192227:91"/>glory and honour, putting all things under his feet, &amp;c. This made <hi>David</hi> underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18, <hi>Who am I, O Lord, and what is my houſe that thou haſt brought me hitherto? and this was yet a ſmall thing in thy ſight, O Lord.</hi> God aggravates our ſins from the ſpecial Providences he hath bleſſed us with; as in the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. and <hi>Saul. Moſes</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to <hi>duty</hi> from Gods ſpecial <hi>Providences</hi> to them, in the four firſt Chapters of <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi> nothing makes us ſo much as them to underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord. Oh therefore obſerve, conſider what God hath done, and what he daily doth for you more than others; preſerving your lives, your health, bleſſing you in your relations, and eſtates, and trades, proſpering and ſucceeding you in your undertakings; above all, what he hath done for your ſouls more than for the ſouls of others, plucking you as brands out of the fire, ſnatching you (as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did <hi>Lot</hi>) out of <hi>Sodom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, This obſervation of <hi>ſpecial Providence,</hi> will more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently engage and <hi>quicken you to duty.</hi> God expects it from you, as you may ſee by <hi>Moſes</hi> his diſcourſe to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the four or five firſt Chapters of <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> and you will find your hearts more enlarged in duty from the ſenſe, and apprehenſion of them. But of this more under the next branch of Application.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> This Doctrine of <hi>ſpecial Providence</hi> calleth upon <hi>all mankind</hi> in general; that <hi>part of them which make up the Church of God more eſpecially;</hi> and yet more particularly, thoſe that <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> for more ſpecial <hi>homage and duty to God:</hi> thoſe gradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you know, I obſerved in ſpecial Providence. The <hi>objects,</hi> the general objects of it, I told you, were <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> I baulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſcourſe of Gods <hi>ſpecial Providence</hi> in the preſervation and Government of the good <hi>Angels;</hi> as that the particulars of which we know little of: ſo neither are they thoſe to whom we are to preach, neither do thoſe bleſſed Spirits need any of our exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: they <hi>ſpontaneouſly, perpetually,</hi> and <hi>without ceaſing</hi> give ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory to God, and do his will; and this in a degree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to that <hi>ſpecial Providence,</hi> by which they are both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and governed. We are bid to pray, that we might be able <hi>on earth</hi> to do the will of God, <hi>as it is done in heaven:</hi> it is to men, to the ſons and daughters of men, that I am to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Let all the ſons and daughters of men then praiſe God,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:192227:92"/>and glorifie him in a degree proportioned to that ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which God exerciſeth toward them in general.</hi> You will ſay, what is that? I anſwer in the general, <hi>It is more than that which God exerciſeth towards any degree of creatures that is beneath them.</hi> There are three orders of creatures beneath man. 1. <hi>Such as have only Being,</hi> no <hi>life,</hi> as the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Waters,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>Such as have Being</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> but no ſenſe, as <hi>berbs</hi> and <hi>plants.</hi> 3. <hi>Such as have Being,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>ſenſe,</hi> but no <hi>reaſon,</hi> as <hi>beaſts, birds, fiſhes, creeping things;</hi> of all theſe God taketh a care, as I have before ſhewed you: but <hi>doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle in my Text), God exerciſeth a more particular ſpecial Providence for all the children of men than for any of theſe. Then certainly every man is obliged to <hi>honour and glorifie God</hi> more than theſe do. There is none of theſe but <hi>glorifieth God</hi> in its kind: The <hi>Heavens declare his glory;</hi> The little Bee and Silk-worm glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth God as they are his workmanſhip, and indued with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualities which ſpeak the infinite wiſdom of God: every ſpire of graſs glorifies God as it ſheweth it ſelf to the world, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth all the art of men to make ſuch a thing. Nay, theſe inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and brute creatures uſe all the faculties and qualities with which they were created, to the end for which God indued them with them. Alas! the beſt of men come much ſhort, none liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſinneth not. None lives who uſeth not ſome of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which God hath given him for his honour and glory, to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice and diſhonour. Wherein then can man live up to the ſpecial Providence, that watcheth over, preſerveth, and governeth him? I anſwer, <hi>In the voluntary directions of his words, thoughts, and actions to the glory of God.</hi> This no creature but man can do; they have no reaſonable ſouls, they act meerly <hi>ex neceſſitate naturae,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the neceſſity of nature impoſed upon them by the Law of creation: God indeed hath an honour from every man, as he is created in the image of God, and is a noble and glorious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. One man may more ſpeak the praiſes of God than another, as he is indued with a greater wit or wiſdom, hath more dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſagacity, more excellent parts than another; but while the poor creatures heart is not right-ſet, and bent, and directed to the glory of God; wherein doth he more than an Element, or a brute Beaſt? that man only in this excelleth a Stone, or a brute Beaſt, that with purpoſe of heart, out of choice, and deſignedly honoureth God: and <hi>quotus quiſque eſt,</hi> how rare is the man in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:192227:92"/>the world that ſets his heart to bring God glory by his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like actions. God hath indeed an accidental glory by moſt mens actions; but it is rather to be ſaid, that God is glorified by them, than that they glorifie God: Now what a ſad reflection this is for a wicked man to think, that <hi>his horſe</hi> more glorifies God than he doth. There's no man liveth, but partaketh more of a ſpecial Providence than any other creature, not of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: certainly God expects from all of you, ſome ſervice proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to this particular Providence. Say to your ſelves ſometimes, What do I more for God than the flower of my Garden? the graſs in my field, the beaſt in my ſtall? and ſee if the anſwer of your ſouls, to ſuch a Queſtion, will not reflect a ſhame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. O ſtudy your ſpecial Providences, and live up to them: remember, that where God hath given much he expects much. But reſt not here, do not only ſtudy the <hi>ſpecial Providences</hi> which you are under, as men, and which are common to all men with your ſelves, or to the moſt of men with your ſelves; but obſerve, and ſtudy alſo the <hi>particular Providences that have followed you,</hi> for which God expecteth a return. It may be you have more wit, more wiſdom than others, you have a greater dexterity in buſineſs: God hath better provided for you, given you a better eſtate, more comforts in your relations, &amp;c. Oh live up to theſe Specialties of Providence: you will expect it from thoſe to whom you have at any time done any good: you are miſtaken if you think that God doth not expect it from you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This more eſpecially calleth to you, <hi>who are the members of the viſible Church,</hi> for <hi>a more ſpecial conſecration and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of your ſelves unto God.</hi> You have heard that the Church is an eminent object of ſpecial Providence many ways; many ſpecial Promiſes are made to it, and that is the body of people of the world whom God careth for: ſee then what a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar obligation lieth upon all profeſſors, all members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, to give God honour and glory. You are the only people in the world, <hi>to whom the Oracles of God are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; you are the pillar of truth;</hi> you are thoſe who do alone enjoy the Ordinances of God: you are the people in the midſt of whom God dwelleth, upon whom the eye of God is from one end of the year to the other. Certainly there lies an high obligation upon you to honour God more than others. God
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:192227:93"/>hath done infinitely more for you than for Heathens. Now what a ſhame it is that an Heathen ſhould out-doe you in any thing; yet give me leave to tell you, that while you only do ſome actions that are materially good, not formally and truly, many Heathens have done as much as you. An Heathen may do, and many of them have done, and that with ſome good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, actions materially good, that is, ſuch things as God commanded. Many of them have been eminent inſtances of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertue, Juſtice, charity, temperance, liberality, &amp;c. many of them have profeſſed to love vertue for the ſake of vertue. Wherein can you excel them? but by doing actions which are <hi>formally good,</hi> deſigning Gods glory, acting in obedience to Gods will, regulating your ſelves as to the manner by Gods word: you have the word, the Goſpel of God, oh how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable it is that our <hi>converſation ſhould be as becomes the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt!</hi> The Heathen elſe that lives up to his light of nature out-does us, and <hi>it will</hi> (as our Saviour tells us) <hi>be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of Judgment than for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But Laſtly, <hi>Let the Saints of God ſee what an obligation, to all manner of duty and holineſs, lies upon their ſouls:</hi> they are the moſt ſpecial objects of <hi>ſpecial Providence.</hi> God takes more care for all men, than for Oxen, or for the graſs of the field; he exerciſeth a more ſpecial Providence for that body of people which make up his viſible Church, than for all the earth beſides: but yet what is that ſpecial Providence which God exerciſeth for meer formal profeſſors, or for any other men in the world, in compariſon of what they have experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced! Any thing of more ſpecial diſtinguiſhing Grace, is a great Specialty of Providence, and that in the beſt and higheſt ſort of good things, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which concern the ſalvation of the Soul. Oh, what doth God expect? what doth God require from you? what ſhould you do more than others? More particularly, This Doctrine of ſpecial Providence calls to you,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For more extraordinary degrees of Love.</hi> 2. <hi>For more ſpecial acts of Faith.</hi> 1. <hi>For more eminent degrees of Love,</hi> Pſal. 31.23, <hi>O Love you the Lord, all you his Saints, for the Lord preſerveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer. Reaſon argueth thus with us,</hi> that the reciprocations of our love ought to bear proportion to love received. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:192227:93"/>our Saviour) <hi>you love them that love you, what reward have you?</hi> the law of nature commandeth us to love, and by actions of kindneſs and duty to expreſs our love to them who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their kindneſs to us: and the ſame reaſon requires the reciprocations of love to be proportionable. God therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring eſpecial love to you, you are bounden in a ſpecial duty to him. Let our Saviours queſtion be often in your thoughts, <hi>What do you do more than others?</hi> If you for whom God hath ſent his Son to dye, and into whoſe hearts he hath ſent his Spirit, the Spirit of <hi>Adoption, Supplication, Conſolation,</hi> and whom the Lord hath from the womb watched over and preſerved by a more ſpecial peculiar Providence, bearing you as upon <hi>Eagles</hi> Wings, and gathering you as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings; I ſay, If you do no more for God than others do, not under ſuch influences, nor ſuch Providences; you muſt certainly act beneath, and ſhort of your duty. This dependeth upon what I told you before, of the reaſonableneſs of the reciprocations of love in ſome commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate proportions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It calleth to them <hi>who fear God,</hi> for ſpecial <hi>exerciſes of faith;</hi> you have reaſon more to <hi>truſt</hi> and <hi>depend</hi> upon God than others, becauſe God hath declared a more ſpecial care and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for you. The ground of all faith is the word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God. Now ſpecial promiſes call for a more ſpecial and peculiar faith. What though another man cannot truſt God contrary to a ſenſible or reaſonable appearance; yet you have reaſon to do it, becauſe God hath declared more his care for you, and the workings of his Providence for your preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deliverance than for others: God hath promiſed to ſave, defend and deliver you, not after the workings of his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Providence. You may therefore ſay with <hi>David, The Lord is my light and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear?</hi> He is the ſtrength of my life, of <hi>whom ſhall I be afraid?</hi> Pſalm 27.1.3, <hi>Though an Hoſt ſhould encamp againſt me, my heart ſhould not fear: though war ſhould riſe againſt me, in this I will be confident.</hi> But thus much ſhall ſerve to have diſcourſed concerning the Specialties of <hi>Divine Providence.</hi>

                  <p>I Have finiſhed my Diſcourſe concerning the principal Acts of Divine Providence, both <hi>generally</hi> and <hi>ſpecially.</hi> I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed concerning Gods general Acts in <hi>preſerving and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning</hi> all his creatures, and concerning God's more ſpecial <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and governing</hi> of ſome creatures. I am now come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning the <hi>Methods</hi> of it, concerning which we muſt cry out with this great Apoſtle; <hi>O the depth both of the wiſdom and knowledg of God! how unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out?</hi> My Text is the concluſion of an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deep diſcourſe, which the Apoſtle had made concerning the <hi>Rejection of the Jews:</hi> which he proves to be neither <hi>Total,</hi> nor <hi>final.</hi> In the ten firſt verſes he proveth that it is not <hi>Total.</hi> V. 2, <hi>God did not caſt off his people, whom he did foreknow.</hi> V. 5, <hi>There is a remnant according to Election.</hi> As it was in <hi>Elias</hi>'s time: he thought, and complain'd <hi>that he was left alone, and they ſought his life alſo:</hi> but he was miſtaken, God at that time had <hi>ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in Iſrael, that had not bowed the knee to Baal.</hi> V. 7, He ſaith, <hi>The Election had obtained,</hi> though ſome, though the moſt of them were rejected: yet the Elect amongſt them were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; and this he proveth to have been but according to what was propheſied. V. 11, He proveth that this Rejection ſhould not be <hi>final:</hi> There ſhould be a <hi>fulneſs of them,</hi> V. 12. <hi>Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:192227:94"/>of them,</hi> V. 15. They ſhould be again <hi>grafted in,</hi> V. 23, 24. It is but (V. 25.) till the <hi>fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhould come,</hi> and then <hi>all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſrael ſhould be ſaved.</hi> This Diſcourſe is mixed with ſeveral arguments to prove the aſſertion, and with ſeveral reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whoſe preſent ſtate was better than theirs: ſhewing them their duty <hi>negatively</hi> and <hi>poſitively: not to be high-minded, but humble; To fear,</hi> &amp;c. Now look as a man wading in deep waters, when he finds the water go over his head, and trip up his heels; he cries out, <hi>O I ſhall be drowned,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to get back again. So doth the bleſſed Apoſtle; he had been wading into the great deeps of Gods counſels and ways: but he findeth that <hi>ſuch knowledg</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) <hi>was too wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him.</hi> In my Text, he doth <hi>referre pedem,</hi> draw his foot backward. I will go back, ſaith he, I will wade no further: <hi>O the depth! There are ſome truths, and ways of God which are unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> We may diſcourſe a little, and more generally of them: but we ſhall never be able to find the bottom of them. It is wiſdom for us in time to retreat, and cry, <hi>O the depth!</hi> But what depth is this? The bleſſed Apoſtle tells you of <hi>the wiſdom and knowledg of God;</hi> in man <hi>knowledg and wiſdom,</hi> are two differing habits; a man may be a <hi>knowing man,</hi> yet not a <hi>wiſe</hi> man. Knowledg ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends things, Wiſdom directs the practice to the beſt ends of humane life. Knowledg is a <hi>ſpeculative habit, Wiſdom; a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal habit.</hi> In God alſo (though he be but one <hi>ſimple act),</hi> we may conceive a difference betwixt <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Knowledg;</hi> but in this Text, poſſibly it is but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, one thing expreſſed by two terms: he is ſpeaking of the <hi>wiſdom,</hi> the unſearchable wiſdom of God in ſome particular acts of his Providence; <hi>How unſearchable are his Judgments, and his ways paſt finding out.</hi> Here are two terms, <hi>Judgments, and Ways:</hi> Both again here ſignifie, 1. the ſame thing. <hi>Judgments</hi> in Scripture, ſometimes ſignifie the ways <hi>and ſtatutes of God;</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Juſtice and righteouſneſs</hi> that is in them. By <hi>Juſtice,</hi> God meaſureth his own Words, and Laws. 2. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Term ſignifieth <hi>corrections</hi> and <hi>chaſtiſements;</hi> becauſe God meaſureth out all theſe likewiſe in Juſtice, and in them act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as a righteous Judg: But here doubtleſs, <hi>Judgments and ways</hi> ſignifie the ſame thing. All Gods ways are Judgments, ways of Juſtice and Equity, and Righteouſneſs. The term <hi>ways,</hi> is alſo uſed in more ſenſes than one: Sometimes it ſignifies the <hi>way of Duty,</hi> wherein we ought to walk towards God, or the courſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:192227:95"/>of mens actions; ſo you read of the <hi>way of the wicked, the way of ſinners:</hi> here it is applied to God, and ſignifies, The courſe and ſeries of his actions towards his creatures; ſo it ſignifies here. Of theſe <hi>Judgments, and ways</hi> of God, of this <hi>wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God,</hi> it is ſaid, They <hi>are unſearchable,</hi> they <hi>are paſt finding out. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſearchable,</hi> that is, ſuch as we can by no means ſearch out, by no means come to the bottom of. The only Propoſition I ſhall inſiſt upon from theſe words, is this:</p>
                  <p>Prop. <hi>The ways of Gods counſels and Providence, are unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and not to be found out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of this Propoſition,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I <hi>will endeavour to prove it to you that it is ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I <hi>will ſhew you how far it is our duty to behold, and to ſearch into them: and to ſhew you alſo wherein they are unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and not to be found out.</hi> Then I ſhall make ſome applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let us firſt ſee how this is eſtabliſhed from Scripture: <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 8.17, <hi>Then I beheld all the works of God, that a man cannot find out his work that is done under the Sun: yea, though a man la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſeek it out, yet he ſhall not find it: yea, though a wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thinketh to know it, yet he ſhall not find it.</hi> A Text which muſt be underſtood of Gods <hi>works of Providence.</hi> The Wiſeman ſaith, <hi>a man cannot find them out,</hi> yea though a man labour to ſeek it, yet he ſhall not find it: He that ſpake this was <hi>Solomon,</hi> a man to whom God had given Wiſdom above all that had been before him, and ſaid that there ſhould be none after him, who ſhould be like unto him. He tells us <hi>ver.</hi> 16, That as he was indued with Wiſdom, enriched with this Talent, ſo he had not laid it up in a Napkin, but had made it his buſineſs to improve it: <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>applied my heart to wiſdom, and to ſee the buſineſs which is done on the earth.</hi> V. 17, you have the concluſion, <hi>That the ways of God were not to be found out; yea though a wiſe man think to know it, yet he ſhall not find it out.</hi> Pſalm 36.6, <hi>His righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is like a great mountain, his judgments are a great deep:</hi> Not a deep only, but a <hi>great deep.</hi> The Sea is called <hi>a great deep;</hi> there is no ſounding the bottom of it in many places: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>what man knoweth the things of a man but the ſpirit of a man that is within him: even ſo no man knoweth the things of God, but the ſpirit of God;</hi> and it muſt be ſo if we conſider the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:192227:95"/>infiniteneſs of the Divine Light, Wiſdom and Underſtanding; <hi>His underſtanding is infinite,</hi> Pſalm 147.5. Now it is ſaid of the works of God, <hi>In wiſdom hath he made them all:</hi> There is the infinite wiſdom of God in the works and contrivances of his Providence. The Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>he dwelleth in that light to which none can approach,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.16: and ſo he walks in that light which none can ſee, and fully comprehend: <hi>There is no ſearching out of his underſtanding,</hi> Iſa. 40.28. The way of the Lord is like the way of an <hi>Eagle in the air;</hi> of a <hi>Serpent upon a Rock,</hi> not to be ſeen, not to be tracked, <hi>Incomprehenſibilis Dei ſapientia inter anguſtias humanae rationis coarctari non poteſt.</hi> It is the ſaying of a grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Gods unſearchable incomprehenſible wiſdom cannot be cooped up within the ſtraits of humane Reaſon: but the Doctrine is experimentally, and <hi>de facto,</hi> evident enough.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, here may ariſe a Queſtion; How far our duty extendeth, as to the ways of Divine Providence? for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we have a duty, a great duty incumbent upon us to Divine Providences. I remember it is the ſaying of <hi>Cicero, Si vera eſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia quorundam philoſophorum, qui omnino nullam rerum humanarum procurationem docent habere Deos; Quae poteſt eſſe pietas? Quae Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio? Quae ſanctitas?</hi> Cicero de Nat. Deorum: <hi>If the opinion of ſome Philoſophers, who deny that the Gods exerciſe any providence (or take any care of humane affairs) be true; What piety can there be? What Religion? What Holineſs.</hi> A ſentence which will let us know that there were ſome amongſt the Heathens that were leſs Atheiſts, than ſome amongſt thoſe who are called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Now the caſe is the ſame, ſuppoſing this Divine Procuration or Providence, if we may not, or do not at all take notice of it. Let me therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe a little concerning the duty of man with reference to the Providence of God; and then I ſhall ſhew you the boundaries of it, and wherein it is unſearchable. I ſhall open the firſt in three or four particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is doubtleſs the duty of <hi>Gods people, To ſee and behold the works of the Lord:</hi> indeed we cannot but ſee them, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes every day. But my meaning is, to <hi>behold the things that are done in the earth, as the works of the Lord.</hi> There are too many that do ſee, and not ſee; they ſee pluckings up, and plantings of Nations and Families, but they ſee nothing of God in theſe effects. They ſay not <hi>this is the Lords doing,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not <hi>marvellous in their eyes:</hi> They ſee <hi>Peſtilences,</hi> ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:192227:96"/>away Cities and Families; <hi>fires</hi> laying populous Cities waſte: Enemies breaking in upon Countries, and ſtrangely over-running them, the hand of God ſweeping away whole Families, but they ſee nothing of God in them: they conſider theſe as terrible things, as misfortunes, to which the ſtate of Humane affairs is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; their Eyes are upon the viſible wheels that turn theſe things, but they ſee not the <hi>wheel</hi> within the <hi>wheel:</hi> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> calleth to us, to <hi>come and behold the works of the Lord, what deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations he hath wrought in the earth.</hi> Men ſee deſolations wrought in the Earth, but they ſee them not as the work of the Lord, as deſolations wrought by him. This is what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, and for which he prayeth againſt them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 28.4, 5, <hi>Give them according to the works of their hands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe they regard not the work of the Lord, nor regard the operations of his hands: he ſhall deſtroy them, and not build them up.</hi> This is a ſign of an Atheiſtical heart, to ſee great changes, and not to ſee God in them: the <hi>Heathens</hi> had more of Religion than this came to. I remember the <hi>Poet</hi> in his deſcription of the ruine of <hi>Troy,</hi> bringeth in <hi>Venus</hi> taking <hi>Aeneas</hi> of his mettal in the laſt defence of his Country, and from taking Revenge on <hi>Helena</hi> the cauſe of it, by ſhewing him the gods at every corner and poſt of the City, helping the <hi>Grecians</hi> to fire it, and to over-turn the walls of it. It is very ſad that amongſt Chriſtians, there ſhould be any that in the great changes which God worketh in <hi>Nations, Cities, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> cannot ſee the great and living God at work, and uſing creatures but as inſtruments in his hand: but this is but a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beholding the <hi>works of Providence,</hi> highly uſeful for the production of pious affections, and ſuch acts of duty as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth; We have a further Duty than this incumbent upon us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not only our Duty to <hi>ſee and behold;</hi> but wiſtly to <hi>conſider</hi> and <hi>obſerve</hi> theſe things. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 107.43, <hi>Whoſo is wiſe will obſerve theſe things, and he ſhall underſtand the loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord,</hi> (a Text which in this diſcourſe I ſhall make a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe of.) Obſervation implieth <hi>the application of our minds, unto the paſſages of Divine Providence</hi> which are <hi>before our eyes:</hi> as we muſt not be careleſs and <hi>forgetful hearers of the word of God,</hi> ſo we muſt not be careleſs and forgetful obſervers of the works of God. It is ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.11, that <hi>Jacob obſerved the ſaying, Joſephs ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the repetition of his Dream, relating to eminent providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:192227:96"/>workings. So it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.19, That when upon the birth of our Saviour, the <hi>Angels</hi> had ſpoke to the Shepherds, and the Shepherds had publiſhed the glad tidings which they had brought to the City, <hi>That all who heard it wondred at thoſe things which were ſpoken by the Shepherds: Mary kept all theſe ſayings, and pondered them in her heart.</hi> To ſee a thing, is one thing, to make our minds to ſtand upon it, to <hi>conſider it,</hi> and to ponder upon it, is another thing. This is alſo our Duty, as to meditate on the Lords words, ſo to <hi>meditate on the Lords works:</hi> twice the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> hath it, <hi>I will meditate on all thy works,</hi> Pſalm 143.5, <hi>I muſe on the works of thy hands.</hi> So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 77. <hi>v.</hi> 12, <hi>I will meditate alſo on all thy works, and talk of thy doings.</hi> It is our great fault, that we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the impreſſion of Gods works to go off our hearts too ſoon. We hear of great changes; we ſee great deſolations, God works in <hi>Kingdoms, Cities,</hi> and Families: at firſt they make a little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon us, we ſtartle at them; but by the next day they are as a tale that is told, the ſound is out of our ears, the impreſſion is off our minds: this is now, not to <hi>obſerve the works of the Lord,</hi> not, as we ought, to <hi>conſider the operation of his hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is thirdly our Duty, <hi>modeſtly and humbly to ſearch out the cauſes of Providences towards our ſelves eſpecially.</hi> We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it.</hi> Thus did <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21: when they were in priſon they ſaid one to another, <hi>We are verily guilty concerning our Brother, when we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul; when he ſought to us, and we would not hear, therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us. Job</hi> prays, <hi>Job</hi> 10.2, <hi>Shew me wherefore thou contendeſt with me:</hi> this is but a <hi>ſearching,</hi> and <hi>trying our ways,</hi> an excellent help, and neceſſary <hi>medium</hi> in order to a true repentance. Indeed it is our great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that we are very prone to ſearch out the cauſes of ſevere Providences upon others. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſeeing a Viper cleave to <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, conclude him a Murtherer; but we are very ſlow and backward, to enquire into the meritorious cauſes of Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Diſpenſations to our ſelves: Yet as to others, as it is our Duty to obſerve the Providences of God to them, ſo we may mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly and humbly ſearch out the cauſes of them. Thus did <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, venia praefata,</hi> having firſt recognized God, in the Juſtice and righteouſneſs of his proceedings: <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, in thy Judgments, when I plead with thee;</hi> yet <hi>let me talk with thee of thy Judgments: why doth the way of the wicked
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:192227:97"/>proſper,</hi> &amp;c? So the Prophet <hi>Habbakuk,</hi> ch. 1.13, <hi>Wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deal treacherouſly, and holdeſt thy tongue, when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?</hi> But as to this ſearching into the cauſes of Divine Providences, I put in thoſe two words, <hi>modeſtly,</hi> and <hi>humbly.</hi> Indeed, God is ſo plain and open in his Judgments ſometimes, that the <hi>provocation</hi> is wrote, and that in capital Letters in the front of the puniſhment. Thus it was in the caſe of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamites; Sauls bloody houſe, Haman,</hi> the final deſtruction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp;c: and thus it is ſtill very often. The <hi>Drunkard</hi> dies in his drunkenneſs; but it is not always ſo. The Judgments <hi>of the Lord are a great deep.</hi> This enquiry therefore into cauſes muſt be modeſt and humble: we muſt no more <hi>caecutire in revelatis,</hi> as to the works of God, than as to the word of God: if we ſee a <hi>blood-thirſty</hi> and <hi>deceitful man,</hi> not living out half his days, a Dart ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king through the liver of the Adulterer; theſe are open things. And when we ſee prophane vile wretches, <hi>devouring thoſe that are more righteous than they:</hi> when we ſee God plaguing men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own heart, chaſtening them every moment, not giving them time to ſwallow their ſpittle: Theſe are ſecrets of Divine Providence, of which we muſt be careful that we paſs no unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cenſure, yea, and we muſt ſearch <hi>humbly</hi> too. Our judgment in theſe cafes will amount to no more, than a judgment of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: we cannot pretend to an infallibility, we are not of Gods counſel, and his ways are great deeps.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, <hi>We ought ſo far to ſearch into, and to enquire into the workings of Divine Providence, as may any way conduce to make us better, by more adoring and revereing God; more avoiding of ſin, more quickning up the habits and exerciſes of grace: but to take heed of ſuch an enquiry as will be of no uſe to us, unleſs to make us Atheiſts,</hi> or <hi>too curious ſearchers into the unſearchable things of God, or uncharitable conſurers of our brethren.</hi> The reafon of this is, becauſe <hi>Duty</hi> is the End of all our beholding, conſidering and obſerving the Lords works, or any way enquiring and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into them. This is the main thing which God hath ſaid to us, <hi>Obey my voice.</hi> Now ſo far as an enquiring into the Lords ways and works of Providence, will help us to <hi>obey the Lords voice,</hi> ſo far doubtleſs it is our Duty. The voice of the Lord is in Scripture everywhere to us; to <hi>fear before him,</hi> to <hi>love him,</hi> to <hi>truſt in him,</hi> to take heed of ſinning againſt him. Now ſo far as
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:192227:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſearching into the cauſes of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> may conduce to quicken us up to theſe Exerciſes, ſo far is it undoubtedly our duty, and a very commendable practice; but where it only tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to make us <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> by ſeeing nothing of the hand of God in them, but confirming a fancy in us, that we have found out the reaſon of all in a neceſſary connexion, or working of natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or only ſerveth us for an advantage or ground for us unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably and uncharitably to judg and cenſure our brethren, ſo far it is undoubtedly ſinful. Where the ſearching of the cauſes of Divine Providence to us, or others may contribute; and ſo far forth, as it may conduce to quicken us up to repentance for them, to a faith in, and a dependence upon God, to make us either more thankful, or any way more holy; ſo far forth it is our advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duty. Thus <hi>Jona</hi>'s reflection upon the ſtorm he met with at Sea, when he was fleeing from God, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.10, 11: and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> brethrens reflection upon the impriſonment they met with in <hi>Egypt,</hi> were both good and pious, tending to bring them to a ſenſe of their ſeveral ſins againſt God. <hi>Davids</hi> obſervation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence helped him in the exerciſe of his Faith; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.34, 35. <hi>Manoahs</hi> obſervation, that <hi>God had accepted a ſacrifice,</hi> confirm'd his faith, that he would not deſtroy them. Oft-times the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of, and ſearching into the ways of Divine Providence, huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exciteth praiſe and thankfulneſs, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 107.8.15, 21, 31, &amp;c. Thus far now it is our duty, to behold, obſerve, ſearch into the ways of Divine Providence; they are not called <hi>unſearchable,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us from beholding, ſeeing and conſidering them, ſo far as it may help in the performance of any piece of that duty which we owe unto God. God hangs out his great works of Providence to the world that men may behold them, look upon them, and that not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially, but wiſtly and conſiderately. Well, but <hi>how are they then unſearchable?</hi> why doth the Apoſtle pronounce them <hi>paſt finding out?</hi> That brings me to the laſt thing promiſed you in the Explication of the Propoſition: I ſhall open it to you in ſeveral particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They are unſearchable and paſt finding out, as to the latitude and full compaſs of them.</hi> Job, ch. 26, had been largely diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great works of <hi>Divine Providence, his ſtretching out the North upon the empty places, and hanging the Earth upon nothing.</hi> Ver. 7, His <hi>binding up the waters in the thick clouds, and the clouds not being rent under them,</hi> ver. 8, &amp;c. But then concludeth <hi>ver.</hi> 14, <hi>Lo theſe are part of his ways, but how little a portion is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:192227:98"/>heard of him? but the thunder of his power, who can underſtand?</hi> ſome read it, Theſe are but <hi>the borders,</hi> ſome <hi>corners of Gods ways. David</hi> telleth us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 111.2, <hi>The works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein.</hi> It is our duty to ſeek out the works of the Lord, and every good man hath a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure therein, and will be modeſtly ſeeking out Gods works; ay, but though they will be ſeeking, yet we ſhall be no more in this World than <hi>ſeekers:</hi> Job 16.7, <hi>Who can find out the Almighty to perfection,</hi> ſaith God? Much of God is ſeen, much of God may be found out; but the perfection of Gods works, as well as of his Divine Being, is an unſearchable thing. There are thouſands of things in the workings of Divine Providence which we cannot find out: infinite motions in the <hi>upholdings of it,</hi> in the <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it,</hi> of which we know nothing; ſomething we can by the helps of Scripture and Reaſon, diſcourſe, how Providence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the great varieties of Beings in the World, the Methods of God in governing the World; but <hi>who can find out the Almighty to perfection?</hi> Who can diſcourſe <hi>the thunder of his power?</hi> There is a <hi>terra incognita,</hi> or rather a <hi>coelum incognitum</hi> in the Divine workings. What <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, we may apply here; <hi>A thing was brought unto me, and my ear received a little thereof.</hi> Many things concerning Gods workings are brought to our ſenſes, and our ſenſes receive, yea our reaſon receiveth a little, and but a little thereof: as to them we may ſay as the Apoſtle ſaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>Where is the Scribe? where is the Wiſe man? where is the diſputer of this World?</hi> We by ſtudy can dive a little into Gods ways; but we muſt come out of our deepeſt ſtudies, crying out with our Apoſtle, <hi>O the depth of the wiſdom and knowledg of God!</hi> This knowledg is, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.7, 8, <hi>As high as heaven, what canſt thou do? deeper than hell, what canſt thou know? the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing <hi>unſearchable, and paſt finding out in theſe ways of God, is the tendency of them, while we ſee them come to an iſſue.</hi> Had one of us been a companion with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſeen him <hi>thrown</hi> into a pit, then ſold into <hi>Egypt;</hi> after this thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a priſon, upon the accuſation of his Miſtriſs, we could never have judged this a Method in order to his riding in the ſecond Chariot, and being the ſecond man in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but we ſee at laſt it was ſo. Had we been in the <hi>Court of Perſia,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> and have ſeen <hi>Haman</hi>'s Exaltation and his power with the King, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:192227:98"/>a Decree from him for the deſtruction of all the <hi>Jews,</hi> we ſhould never have ſeen the tendency of this to the ruin of <hi>Haman,</hi> the <hi>exaltation</hi> of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> &amp;c. Had we ſeen <hi>Daniel</hi> thrown into the <hi>Lion's</hi> Den, we could never have read the tendency of this to his greater exaltation and fuller preferment, and conqueſt over his Enemies; and yet ſo it was. The tendencies of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are ſometimes by us boldly determined; ſometimes gueſſed at: but how unſearchable are the ways of God in them? How ſtrangely are we every day miſtaken in what we judged the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and tendency of many motions of Providence, proving in the iſſue quite contrary to what we expected.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A <hi>third</hi> unſearchable thing in <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> is <hi>the track of it.</hi> Neceſſary cauſes (and ſuch Natural cauſes are) have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain track, you may follow the prints of their feet: <hi>Moral and voluntary cauſes</hi> have not ſuch a <hi>certain track,</hi> moving not like Machines, but as influenced from the <hi>will of man;</hi> but yet there is ſomething of ordinary certainty in them. Reaſon in all men, and in men of ſeveral ages is much a kin; whence that certainty doth ariſe, as well as from the finiteneſs of mens wiſdom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. But here God is <hi>unſearchable:</hi> he doth not always do the ſame things, the ſame ways; ſometimes by humane means, ſometimes without means, ſometimes by improbable means: ſometimes adding by a preternatural power to natural cauſes: ſometimes by ſuſpending their acts; ſometimes by over-ruling their motions and workings, all in infinite variety: ſo as his ways are like the ways of a <hi>Ship</hi> in the ſea, an <hi>Eagle</hi> in the air, a <hi>Serpent</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Rock; you can track them in none of their ways. By Faith we know that God will deliver his people; but how, and by what means, or when, we know not. Sometimes <hi>proſperity ſhall ſlay the fool,</hi> ſometimes he ſhall periſh by adverſity; ſometimes the Sinner ſhall be cut off in the middle of his days, ſometimes he ſhall live to an extream old age: men keep a path and a track in their motions, but God keepeth none. <hi>Naaman</hi> did ill, when he came to the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be healed of his Leproſie, to be preſcribing to him ſo much as in his thoughts, thinking <hi>that the Prophet</hi> muſt needs come down, and ſtroke the ſore, &amp;c. Gods way or method of Providence, in bringing about the effects of his counſels and purpoſes, is unſearchable.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth thing which in the motions of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is unſearchable, is the <hi>indications of it. Solomon</hi> telleth us, that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:192227:99"/>
                     <hi>the righteous</hi> and <hi>the wiſe, and their works are in the hand of the Lord,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.1, 2. Unto all men there is one event, both to the righteous and to the wicked: No man can know either love or hatred, by all that is before him in this life. <hi>Eſau</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, yet he hath the mountains of <hi>Edom</hi> given him for his portion, and the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt not diſpoſſeſs him. <hi>Jacob</hi> is beloved, yet muſt he fly to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> endure the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of weather to feed his Uncles flocks, &amp;c. and when he cometh away, he muſt once and again run the hazard of his life. No man can expound the Providences of God unto any to make them indications of <hi>Gods love or hatred. Iſrael</hi> is the people beloved of the Lord, yet they muſt ſerve an hard ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude in <hi>Egypt;</hi> then forty years together, by travelling through a deſolate and howling Wilderneſs. <hi>Dives</hi> is rich, cloathed with purple, and fareth deliciouſly every day; yet when he dyeth goeth to Hell. <hi>Lazarus</hi> is a poor beggar at his gates, cloathed with rags, abounding with ſores, yet when he dies is by Angels carried to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom. <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> all rich men, yet very good, and heirs of the Kingdom of God: Others very poor, yet every-whit as poor ſpiritually, and miſerable as to their ſpiritual eſtate, as they are in reſpect to their outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Grateful Providences ſpeak the appearing love of God to us, and oblige us to thankfulneſs, but they do not ſpeak ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſtinguiſhing love. Adverſe Providences appear as the frowns of God upon us, yet may be but the chaſtenings of an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent father, who chaſteneth whom he loveth, and ſcourgeth every child whom he receiveth. Hell begins with ſome in this life; their life is but a life of miſery, and leadeth into that miſery which ſhall never have an end: ſometimes men in the enjoyments of this life are lifted up to Heaven, but it is—<hi>ut lapſu graviore ruant,</hi> that their fall may be the greater into the pit prepared for them. The Indications of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are altogether unſearchable. No man can know love or hatred by any thing which is before him in this life.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fifth unſearchable thing in <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> is the <hi>cauſes of them.</hi> There is infinite wiſdom and reaſon in all the diſpenſations of Providence. In wiſdom hath the Lord done, and made whatſoever he hath done: but this wiſdom of God, as to all his works of Providence, is not always evident to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:192227:99"/>us. It is one of thoſe things, which Divines ſay, we ſhall more perfectly underſtand at the day of Judgment, and in another life, than we yet do, how wiſely the infinite wiſe God hath managed the Government of the World. We are oft-times ſtartled, and troubled, and amazed to ſee the works of God in the World, and at loſs to compound them with the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his love to his people, and the great number of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to them. What Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> We may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply here, what God is doing we do not know here, but <hi>we ſhall know hereafter.</hi> We cannot tell the reaſon of a thouſand diſpenſations of God to his Church and people here, but we ſhall know them hereafter. Sometimes we know much of them in this life, but what we do not know in this life we ſhall know in the day, when <hi>all hidden things ſhall be made manifeſt,</hi> and all the works as well as all the Saints of God ſhall praiſe him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, The <hi>windings</hi> of <hi>Providence are unſearchable.</hi> It is with the Providence of God, as it is with a man of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is riding to <hi>London;</hi> that is his utmoſt journey, but he doth not like a Poſt keep his road, but rides out this way and that way, to ſpeak with this and that man, as his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs leadeth him. The Providence of God drives at the ſecuring of his Church, the deſtruction of his Enemies, the promoving of Gods glory, &amp;c. But it carrieth on many deſigns together, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the chaſtiſing of his people for their ſins, the ſuffering of the <hi>Amorites</hi> to make up their meaſure: ſo it winds in its motions, and the reaſon of the variety of its windings and turnings we do not underſtand. But this is much co incident with what I told you before concerning the tracks of Divine Providence, that they are paſt finding out. I come therefore now to the Application. I ſhall there only ſhew you the uſefulneſs of this point. 1. <hi>To check curioſity.</hi> 2. <hi>To direct you in ſpiritual duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Let this check that <hi>curioſity which ſo much infecteth humane nature, and to which the wiſer part of men are moſtly too ſubject.</hi> It was the complaint, long ſince, of an acute Author, <hi>Iſte labor vexat homines ut plus Deum laborent intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligere, quam diligere—malumus veſtigando laborare quam amando reperire, malumus inquirere, quam invenire &amp; perfrui.</hi>—<q>This is a labour which vexeth men;</q> they take more pains to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, than to love God. We had rather tire our ſelves by ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:192227:100"/>than by loving find God. We had rather enquire than find and enjoy. <hi>Curioſity</hi> is a great piece of the vanity of the mind of man: it was <hi>Eves</hi> temptation to eat of the true knowledg <hi>of good and evil,</hi> that ſhe might be like God knowing it. It is a <hi>luſt inclining a man to employ his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes and his underſtanding, to an inordinate gaining of ſome knowledg which God hath hidden from him.</hi> Knowledg is good; it is the light of the ſoul. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>That it is not good that the ſoul ſhould be without it.</hi> But there is a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that is <hi>too wonderful for us.</hi> Secret things belong unto God. Our Saviour told us, that there is a day and hour of which none can have any knowledg, no not the Angels. <hi>It is not for you,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>to know the times and ſeaſons, which the father hath put in his own power,</hi> Acts 1.7. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of truth is good, but it may be accidentally evil.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the <hi>End be naught:</hi> If a man deſires to know only that he may be able to <hi>cavil</hi> and <hi>diſpute,</hi> or, that he may be thought wiſer than others. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is not good for a man to eat much honey: ſo for a man to ſeek his own glory, is not glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>If we will uſe unlawful means to gain it;</hi> ſuch are now going to <hi>witches</hi> and <hi>wizards, Aſtrologers, Star-gazers,</hi> cunning men, as <hi>Ahaziah</hi> ſent to <hi>Baalzebub the god of Ekron,</hi> to know whether he ſhould recover of that diſeaſe; and <hi>Saul</hi> went to the <hi>witch of Endor</hi> to raiſe up <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Devil in the likeneſs of <hi>Samuel,</hi> to tell him the fate of the approaching Battel. A practice too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent amongſt ſimple people in theſe days, and places where we live.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>When men have an itch to know what God hath concealed from them.</hi> It was an excellent advice of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> That men ſhould neither be too curious to pry into ſecret things, nor be blind as to what God had revealed. To do the firſt, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably curious; the latter is damnable unthankfulneſs. <hi>Vain man would be wiſe,</hi> and ſo becometh indeed more fooliſh in his imaginations. <hi>Plutarch</hi> well compareth men infected with this itch, to thoſe that ſhould not be content to behold the <hi>Sun</hi> in the firmament, but muſt make a Ladder to climb up to ſee it in its Throne; we ſhall find the beſt of men had ſomething of this diſeaſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lord, ſhew me thy Glory. Philip</hi> ſaith, <hi>Shew us the Father.</hi> The Diſciples ſay, <hi>Wilt thou not this time reſtore the Kingdom to Iſrael?</hi> And again, <hi>Lord, When ſhall theſe things be?</hi> Now as this Curioſity in us ſheweth it ſelf in other things,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:192227:100"/>ſo it wonderfully buſieth it ſelf as to the ways of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to find out all the ways of God, and track him in his moſt ſecret paths; to underſtand the reaſons of Gods dealings, the <hi>tendencies</hi> and indications of them. <hi>But oh! the depth of the wiſdom and knowledg of God! how unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt ſinding out!</hi> Let me offer you two or three Meditations to give check to this luſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It is an unprofitable labour.</hi> It is a labour; <hi>much ſtudy is a wearineſs to the fleſh:</hi> and it is an unprofitable labour, by ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou canſt not find out what thou ſearcheſt for: <hi>Should a wiſe man utter vain knowledg</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eliphaz),</hi> Job 15.2? <hi>Should a wiſe man ſeek after knowledg in vain, and fill his belly with the eaſt-wind?</hi> The boy in <hi>Plutarch</hi> carrying a covered diſh, anſwered him well, that would know what was in it, by telling him, <hi>It was therefore covered that he might not know what was in it.</hi> God hath alſo his covered diſhes, man will be enquiring what is in them; but he ought to know that God hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore covered them, that he might not know, and therefore it is but a vain thing for him to enquire and ask. Should a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, an underſtanding Chriſtian, buſie himſelf in ſearching out that which he cannot find out, when he hath wearied himſelf in a long and vain enquiry? as ſoon may you track an Eagle in the air, or a Ship on the Sea, as God in the ways and methods of his Providence: ſuch knowledg, when you have done what you can, will prove too wonderful for you. No wiſe man will labour in vain, and ſpend his time, and his wit, and parts to find out that, which he is aſſured he ſhall never find out by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You ſhall obſerve <hi>our bleſſed Lord continually checking ſuch enquirers:</hi> one while putting them off, and directing them to more profitable employment for their thoughts; as when they asked him, <hi>If there were few that ſhould be ſaved,</hi> he bids them <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> Luk 13.21, 22. When they asked him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.3. <hi>When ſhall theſe things be?</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, <hi>Take heed that no man deceive you:</hi> ſometimes he chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> asked, <hi>John</hi> 21.21. <hi>And what ſhall this man do?</hi> Chriſt anſwereth, <hi>If I will, that he tarry until I come, What is that to thee? Follow thou me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:192227:101"/>3. Laſtly, It commonly produceth <hi>error in our imaginations, vain thoughts, bold determinations of the Councels of God, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs prophecies, erroneous apprehenſions both of God, and of his ways.</hi> What ſtrange effects have mens curious enquiries about the time for the <hi>calling of the Jews,</hi> the <hi>ruin of Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>day of Judgment</hi> produced in the world? What have men at laſt found out about them, that a wiſe man can ſet his foot upon? Verily they have laboured for the wind, and filled their belly with the eaſt-wind, and run themſelves into a temptation to believe nothing of Scripture, becauſe their miſ-apprehenſions about thoſe dark portions of them, have failed them. There are ſome things, of which we may ſay, <hi>Bona coecitas eſt non videre, &amp; quae ſcire non licet piè ignorance;</hi> 
                     <q>It is a good blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not to ſee them, but to be piouſly ignorant of what we cannot lawfully know.</q> Let us labour to know God, and the <hi>Will</hi> of God ſo far as he hath revealed it. But for a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God in all his ways, for a perfect knowledg of him, it is too high, it is too wonderful for us: let us more ſtudy to love him, than to know him. By our underſtanding and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of God, <hi>we draw God to us.</hi> By <hi>Love</hi> we <hi>pour our ſelves into the boſom of God.</hi> Knowledg and Wiſdom, let us have never ſuch degrees of it, if <hi>love</hi> to God be not as the ſoul to give it life, ſignifie nothing; and indeed Love is the end of all knowledg, and knowledg without Love is very unprofitable and inſignificant. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.) <hi>I knew all myſteries: yet if I have not love, I am but as a founding-braſs, and as a tinkling-cymbal.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. But in the ſecond place. This diſcourſe concerning the unſearchable things of Divine Providence, may ſerve <hi>to direct us as to much ſpiritual duty.</hi> I will ſhew you this in four or five particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to be wiſe to ſobriety.</hi> We tranſlate it, <hi>Not to think of himſelf more highly than he ought to think, but to think ſoberly.</hi> It may as well be tranſlated, <hi>Not to be wiſe above what we ought to be wiſe, but to be wiſe ſoberly.</hi> The Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. <hi>makes an intruding into things which we have not ſeen,</hi> but a ſign of <hi>ones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puft up with a fleſhly mind. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, when a thing is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, <hi>Et aperte divina Scriptura non ſubvenit, temere aliquid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finire humana conjectura praeſumit,</hi> Aug. <q>And the Scripture
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:192227:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>doth not plainly help, humane Wiſdom doth but preſume, raſhly to define any thing about it.</q> 'Tis an excellent thing for a Chriſtian to know his meaſures, not to reach at further degrees of knowledg, about the ſecret things of God, than it hath pleaſed God in his Word to communicate unto us: that is the true boundary of ſpiritual knowledg. But I ſhall not inlarge upon this. This is now oppoſite to that <hi>curioſity,</hi> which I largely reflected upon under the firſt head of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This in the ſecond place calleth to us for a deep <hi>adoration,</hi> and <hi>veneration</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> This is one reaſon why the Lord hath made <hi>his judgments ſo unſearchable, his ways paſt finding out.</hi> An holy, and humble <hi>admiration of God,</hi> is one piece of that homage, which our ſouls owe to God: <hi>He is to be admired of all them that believe,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.10. All admiration is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſome ignorance, we ſeldom, or very little admire what we fully and perfectly underſtand. The unſearchableneſs of God in his ways, makes him the true and proper object of our admiration, and <hi>admiration</hi> giveth God the honour of his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchableneſs.</hi> Take heed of denying, or diſputing what the Scriptures reveal of God, becauſe you cannot comprehend and fathom it. Where you cannot comprehend him, there it is your duty to adore, and to admire him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Propoſition calleth aloud to all, <hi>To take heed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the motions and iſſues of Providence, the rule and guide of their actions.</hi> We are to follow the <hi>rule of the word,</hi> not the windings of <hi>Providence.</hi> I told you before, that <hi>Providence</hi> is like a man of buſineſs, that carrieth a great many deſigns in his head at once, and ſeldom keepeth his road: he that will bear ſuch a man company to <hi>London,</hi> or any other place, which is the ultimate end of his journy, may go a great deal out of his way, and where he hath nothing to do, and be a great while longer than he need, before he cometh there; neither muſt the opportunities which Providence offereth be always taken, nor concluſions be made from the ſucceſſes or frowns of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Learn hence <hi>to take heed of raiſing either too ſweet, or too bitter concluſions for, or againſt your ſelves, from the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God.</hi> The <hi>indications, reaſons, tendencies</hi> of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:192227:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>are all unſearchable things. Love or hatred cannot be concluded from what is before you in this life. <hi>Providence</hi> carrieth many to hell by a gale of proſperity; and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven by a whirlwind of adverſity; the way to heaven is <hi>by much tribulation:</hi> ſome are ſcourged into heaven, others go leaping and dancing into the lake, which burns with fire and brimſtone.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Though it be our duty <hi>to be wiſe unto ſobriety,</hi> and not to ſearch curiouſly into what God hideth from us, though we cannot make either the motions or iſſues of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the rule of our duty or action, becauſe in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, it ſometimes pointeth one way, when the rule of the word directeth us another; yet it is our duty to <hi>obſerve</hi> the <hi>motions</hi> and paſſages of Divine Providence, to behold, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, ponder them, and to lay them up in our hearts. Now what obſervation of Providence is our duty; or what obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable things there are in the workings and motions of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, muſt be the ſubject of a far larger diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

                  <p>WHoſo wiſtly caſteth his eyes upon this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> will find it from firſt to laſt a <hi>Song of Providence,</hi> intermixed with frequent exhortations or wiſhes, <hi>That men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his wonderful works to the children of men.</hi> My Text is the concluſion of this excellent Song, <hi>Whoſo is wiſe, obſerveth theſe things.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> hath much ſuch a concluſion of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Who is wiſe, and he ſhall underſtand theſe things; prudent, and he ſhall know them?</hi> The Propoſition of the Text is plainly this:</p>
                  <p>Prop. <hi>It is an argument of ſpiritual wiſdom in men to obſerve the motions of Divine Providence: and thoſe that do it ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> The Propoſition you ſee hath two Branches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is an argument of ſpiritual wiſdom, to obſerve the motions of Divine Providence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That he who doth obſerve them, ſhall underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The work commended to us, is the <hi>obſervation of Providence.</hi> The honour and reward of the work is expreſſed in two things: 1. It ſpeaketh a man <hi>wiſe, truly, ſpiritually wiſe.</hi> 2. <hi>He ſhall underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> The word which we tranſlate [obſerveth] is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a word that ſignifies to <hi>keep,</hi> and to <hi>obſerve:</hi> it is often uſed in Scripture to ſignifie a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:192227:103"/>ſafely, and tranſlated by the LXX by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>He ſhall keep me in the way wherein I ſhall walk: and he that keepeth Iſrael, neither ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth,</hi> Pſal. 121.4. <hi>And he ſhall give his angels charge over thee, and they ſhall keep thee,</hi> Pſal. 91.11. In all thoſe Texts the ſame word is uſed, ſometimes it is uſed to ſignifie ſuch a keeping of Gods Commandments, as ſheweth it ſelf in practice, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.17. and chap. 8.2. ſometimes a keeping of them in our mind, as in that Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.10. <hi>Jacob kept the ſaying,</hi> the LXX interpret it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Pagnine</hi> ſaith of it, <hi>Curam, ſollicitudinem &amp; diligentiam denotat, ne quid emittatur, elabatur aut excutiatur.</hi> 
                     <q>It denotes care, ſollicitude and diligence, that nothing ſlip out, or be let go, or ſhaken out.</q> In ſhort, I conceive this duty of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the works of the Lord, his great and various works of Providence, may be diſpatched in three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In a conſiderate beholding and looking upon them:</hi> Works of Providence, paſs before our eyes every day, but the truth is, for the moſt part, we ſee, and do not ſee them, that is, we do not conſiderately, and deliberately fix our eyes upon them, and ſee them as the Lords works; we ſee them as events in the world, but conſider not the operation of Gods hands in them. This is no obſerving of them. Obſerving them argues a fixing of the eye of the mind, as well as the body upon them, without which, a tranſient view of them, is of very little ſignificancy and import unto men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In a diligent <hi>repoſing them in our minds:</hi> this is that which we call a <hi>remembring of them.</hi> The Lord doth his great work <hi>to be had in remembrance.</hi> This is a conſequent of the other, we remember little of thoſe things we only curſorily view as they come before us: but when we ſix our eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and apply our minds to the knowledg of them, then we remember them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In a continued and repeated view of them, and reflexion upon them.</hi> That man that ſuffereth not the great and daily workings of Divine Providence to paſs by his eyes, as a tale paſſeth through his ears, which he heedeth not, nor applieth his mind unto, but fixeth his eye and mind upon them, lodgeth them in his memory, frequently reflecteth upon them, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and re-conſidereth them in his thoughts; that is a <hi>wiſe man, and he ſhall underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord:</hi> And
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:192227:103"/>that brings me to the ſecond Queſtion in the Explication of the Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How is he wiſe? how is it an argument of wiſdom? and doth he appear to be a wiſe man, who obſerveth theſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Providence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is ſometimes taken in a <hi>larger ſenſe,</hi> ſo a knowing underſtanding man is a wiſe man; ſometimes <hi>in a ſtricter ſenſe,</hi> as it ſignifieth a <hi>practical habit,</hi> directing the <hi>life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> ſometimes as comprehending both, and ſo I ſhall take it in the Propoſition. He is a <hi>wiſe man,</hi> he will have more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and underſtanding than another man, and will know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how to order and direct himſelf in the ſeveral parts of his Converſation:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He will be a more knowing and underſtanding man.</hi> We uſe to ſay, <hi>Experience is the miſtris of fools:</hi> Experience maketh a fool wiſe, and indeed without it notions give little wiſdom; we ſpeak in the commendation of the ableſt perſons, in any <hi>art</hi> or <hi>profeſſion,</hi> ſuch a one is an <hi>experienced man;</hi> and the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced any one is in his art, or courſe, the better you account him in it. Nothing is ſo well learned by <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>precept,</hi> as by <hi>example</hi> and <hi>preſident.</hi> Hence it is a common maxim of theſe times, <hi>That the ſtudy of books accompliſheth none ſo much, as the ſtudy of men doth.</hi> Knowledg is much increaſed by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental obſervation. By this, <hi>Much of the knowledg of God will be let into the ſoul.</hi> We cannot ſee God as he is, in his own light we muſt behold him, <hi>in his word, and in his works.</hi> From the Word of God we get a great knowledg of God, what he is as to his <hi>Divine Being,</hi> and in his <hi>glorious Attributes;</hi> but the <hi>knowledg</hi> which we have of God from his Word, is both <hi>confirmed</hi> in us, and increaſed by his <hi>works of Providence;</hi> and our obſervation of them, as well as of his great work of <hi>Creation.</hi> And that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As they eſtabliſh the Propoſition of the word, and confirm our faith in it.</hi> Pſal. 48.8. <hi>As we have heard, ſo haeve we ſeen in the city of our God, God will eſtabliſh it for ever.</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration confirms us in our notions. The Church had before learned it, that God would eſtabliſh his Church; but now they were confirmed in it, when they had ſeen it in the Works of Providence, what they had before heard from the mouth of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:192227:104"/>Gods Prophets and Meſſengers: indeed a notion is but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationer in our ſouls, until we come to have it eſtabliſhed by Faith and Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>An obſervation of Providence doth alſo increaſe knowledg, as it expounds to us the word of God, and giveth us a more certain, clear, and diſtinct knowledg of the revelations of it.</hi> We do not know how to expound <hi>ſome words of God,</hi> but as we are taught the meaning of them by his Providential Diſpenſations in the fulfilling of it. Gods diſpenſations in the world, both toward his Church, and the enemies and perſecutors, help us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand both his promiſes and his threatnings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He who obſerveth the motions of Divine Providence, <hi>will alſo know better how to order and direct his life.</hi> I told you, that <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſtrictly taken, is a practical habit directing this: He that thus obſerveth, will beſt know how to order his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. But will ſome ſay, Is not this to <hi>make Providence our rule?</hi> I anſwer, It is one thing to make the <hi>Providence of God an argument to juſtifie our actions, which the word condemneth: Another thing to take occaſions from Providence for the performance of our duty.</hi> Providence alone is no rule of our actions; but the word, which is the rule of our actions, is more ſealed and confirmed to us by Providence. Though Providences give no rule, yet they wonderfully confirm and eſtabliſh a rule; when what we have read and heard in the word, we ſee in the dealings of God, it giveth a new life, and makes a new impreſſion of the rule upon our hearts. God hath ſaid, <hi>Blood-thirſty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful men ſhall not live out half their days:</hi> and <hi>honour thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God give thee.</hi> Now when we ſee God cutting off cruel and bloody men in the ſtrength of their years, or cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off a ſtubborn and rebellious Child in his youth; it won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully confirmeth the word to us, and helpeth us to guide our Converſation, ſo as we may not tread in their ſteps, and be partakers of their Judgments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, Though Providence <hi>be no rule as to particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet it is a great help to us, as to the three great principles of all our ſpiritual actions:</hi> which are <hi>Faith, Fear, Love.</hi> It is true, the Propoſition of the word is the object of our Faith; when a ſoul giveth aſſent to the Propoſition of the word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Authority of God, who hath revealed it: and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:192227:104"/>this is the reaſon why wicked men, though they have the Scriptures as well as others, yet walk not in the light of them, becauſe they believe them not, they aſſent not to the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Truth that are revealed in them; but either ſay in their heart, That it is but the fancy and invention of men, or elſe flatter themſelves with the hopes of impunity, ſaying with thoſe in <hi>Deuteronomy, That they ſhall have peace, although they walk according to the imaginations of their own hearts.</hi> But now when a man obſerveth the Providence of God exemplifying, and verifying the Word of God; it much helps his <hi>faith in the word,</hi> eſpecially as to thoſe in whoſe heart God hath wrought a previous habit of Faith. It is true, in this caſe the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God will do little alone: we have the words of Chriſt, <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets: if they will not believe, they will not believe if one ſhould riſe from the dead:</hi> But where a ſoul is firſt taught of God to give a credit to his word, if his faith be weak and languid, the exemplifying of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Word of God, by the iſſues of Providence, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much to the confirmation of the ſouls faith and aſſent; and therefore it is laid to the charge of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as a great aggravation of their ſins, <hi>That they believed not for all his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous works.</hi> And this was the great aggravation of the ſin of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> that lived in the time, when our Saviour was upon the Earth; that although the Providence of God had declared Chriſt to be the Son of God, by his doing ſuch works, as no man ever did, and by ſuch evident ſigns and tokens, as never before were declared as to any man, yet they believed him not to be the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As <hi>Faith</hi> is one great principle of all our ſpiritual actions, ſo <hi>Fear</hi> is another. Now the obſerving of Divine Providences much conduceth to this: It is particularly remark't by the Holy Ghoſt, upon the ſudden death of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, That a great fear came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard of thoſe things:</hi> And in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> you ſhall find God commanding exemplary Juſtice to be done upon ſome remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offenders for this very end, <hi>That all Iſrael might hear and fear.</hi> It is particularly ſaid, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.16. When <hi>Jonah</hi> had told them the cauſe of the ſtorm, and they had thrown him over-board; <hi>Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſacrifices, and made vows.</hi> Severe Providences without
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:192227:105"/>the word make men ſtartle, and put them into a paſſion of fear; but when they follow a <hi>word of threatning,</hi> and they do but ſee God doing what in his word he hath ſaid he will do: this muſt needs have a great power and influence upon the heart, eſpecially upon the hearts of ſuch as before had an habit of Divine Fear wrought in them, though it were ſmothered with the aſhes of too much carnal ſecurity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Love to God is a third principle of ſpiritual action:</hi> an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit wrought in the ſoul of every Child of God, but not at all times ſo lively, and quick, and working as it ought to be. Now the obſervation of Gods good and gracious Providences, ſerves hugely to excite it, and to blow up the Coals of it in the ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.23. <hi>O love you the Lord all his Saints! for the Lord preſerveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</hi> But this will be further enlarged upon in my diſcourſe upon the ſecond branch of the Propoſition, which I now come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon.</p>
                  <p>Mem. 2. <hi>Whoſo obſerveth the Providences of God, he ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I take the word <hi>underſtand</hi> here to ſignifie three things: 1. <hi>Knowledg.</hi> 2. <hi>A more clear and diſtinct knowledg.</hi> 3. <hi>A more demonſtrative and experimental knowledg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He ſhall know the loving-kindneſs of the Lord;</hi> underſtand it with reference to the Church and People of God: for Gods Providence is like the Cloud, which conducted the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and through the Red-ſea; it hath a light-ſide, which hath an aſpect upon Gods <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and it hath a black and dark-ſide towards his enemies. Now he who obſerveth Divine Providence, will know this, <hi>That all the ways of the Lord are mercy, and truth to thoſe that fear God,</hi> Pſal. 25.10. A ſlight and tranſient view of Divine Providence, will not bring a man to the knowledg of this; but a wiſt view and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Divine Providence in the courſe and ſeries of it will do it. The word of God ſpeaketh much of the Love and Favour of God to his People. <hi>Providence</hi> to the ſtrict and conſtant obſerver of it, will confirm all theſe words: God himſelf (ſpeaking after the manner of men to <hi>Abraham</hi>) ſpeaks as if he had not known his love and obedience to him, till he had made an experiment of it, and ſaw that he would
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:192227:105"/>not have withheld from him his Son, even his only Son. We know nothing of the loving-kindneſs of God, before we ſee it experimented, and brought into demonſtration, in compariſon with what we know upon ſuch an evidence: and this we gain by our conſiderate obſervation of the motions of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He who obſerveth the motions of Providence, ſhall have <hi>a more diſtinct knowledg of the loving-kindneſs of God.</hi> He ſhall not only know that God is good to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to all that are of a clean heart; but he ſhall alſo ſee ſomething of the Methods of God in the exerciſe of his loving-kindneſs. When we ſpeak of the Love and Favour of God to his People, we are prone to underſtand by it, nothing but pleaſing Providences, grateful to our ſenſes: now the <hi>loving-kindneſs</hi> of God is not only ſeen in pleaſing diſpenſations, but in adverſe Providences alſo; <hi>Whom he loveth, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every child whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth: All things are yours</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle). This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg muſt be gained by <hi>obſervation.</hi> Senſe looks upon croſs diſpenſations of Providence, and it may be Reaſon judging of them from preſent appearances, and effects, cryeth out, <hi>All theſe things are againſt me:</hi> Here is nothing of promiſed loving-kindneſs in all this. <hi>Is his mercy clean gone? doth his promiſe fail for evermore?</hi> But whoſo obſerveth Divine Providence, will in theſe things alſo underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord, and know that it is the method of Divine Providence, to deal out the loving-kindneſs of God to the Souls of his People, through croſſes and tryals, and afflictions, in a way, which at preſent they do not underſtand and know, but ſhall know here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>No affliction</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is joyous at preſent, but grievous; but it bringeth forth afterward, the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs, to them that are exerciſed thereby,</hi> Heb. 12.11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> (thirdly) <hi>may ſignifie experience;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there is no ſuch underſtanding as experience gives. Every Child of God that obſerveth Divine Providence, ſhall find it (let the wind of it blow which way it will) giving him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment and demonſtration of the Love of God to his Soul. But thus much ſhall ſerve to have ſpoken to the Explication of this Propoſition in both branches. I come to the proof of it, to ſhew you how it appeareth, That he who obſerveth the motions of Divine Providence, and he alone ſhall underſtand
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:192227:106"/>the loving-kindneſs of the Lord. It will appear to you if you but conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That however things go in the courſe of Providence; yet it is moſt certain that they are mercy, and truth to them who fear God.</hi> For this we have a certain word: <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25.10, <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy, and truth unto ſuch as keep his Covenant, and his Teſtimonies.</hi> And again, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73.1, <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael.</hi> In my former Diſcourſe, I ſhewed you three Objects of ſpecial Providence: 1. <hi>Rational creatures</hi> are a more <hi>ſpecial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of Providence, than either inanimate or brute creatures. 2. Amongſt rational Creatures, thoſe men and women in the World which make up <hi>the Church,</hi> are more peculiar, and ſpecial objects of Providence, than all others in the World. 3. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them <hi>ſuch as fear and love God in ſincerity,</hi> are yet the more peculiar objects of Divine Providence; and which God hath a moſt peculiar regard unto, which maketh a cogent argument to prove, That ſuppoſing the glory of God to be the great end of all his providential Diſpenſations; that the Providence of God muſt moſt eminently work for the good of theſe as being ſuch, who moſt eminently ſerve the great end of his Glory. So as he who obſerveth the motions of it, muſt needs by them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord towards them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The mercy and truth of Gods ways towards them that fear him, are not to be read in the ſurface of preſent Providences.</hi> The dark ſide of the cloud, is ſometimes towards the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God; and at ſuch a time it muſt be by Faith, that we underſtand that the ways, all the ways of the Lord, are mercy and truth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his own people. Who could read the loving-kindneſs of the Lord towards <hi>Iſrael,</hi> while they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſerving at the Brick-kilns, and under their great oppreſſion there? but he who obſerved the Providence of God, thus working to make them willing to go out, and take poſſeſſion of the promiſed Land, he might underſtand this. It is not every motion of Providence, but the iſſues of it, that demonſtrate all the ways of the Lord to be mercy and truth; and this evinceth to us, that an <hi>obſervation</hi> of the motions of Divine Providence, yea, and a wiſt, and diligent, and continuing, obſervation of them alſo, is neceſſary to make us underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord. I come now to the Application of what you have heard upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:192227:106"/>
                  <p>This in the firſt place ſheweth us <hi>one great reaſon of that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance which is in men, both concerning God, and concernng their own duty. Men know little of God,</hi> and little, how to govern their actions according to any degree of Chriſtian prudence. As ignorance of, and unbelief in, the Word of God is one great cauſe; ſo their not obſerving the motions of Divine Providence, which have been in the World, is another no ſmall cauſe of it. Men are much ignorant of God; indeed there is but little of the knowledg of God in the World, eſpecially that knowledg, which floateth not only in the brain, but influenceth the heart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and men know little how to govern their actions by any ſpiritual wiſdom, but live directly contrary to what they own, and pretend to as their higheſt end. And we underſtand as little of the loving-kindneſs of the Lord; I ſay, one great cauſe of this is mens not obſerving the workings and motions of Providence. They paſs before their eyes every day, but they obſerve them not: <hi>Non tantum oculis intueri, ſed animum ad hanc conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem ita exuſcitare, ut meliores inde evadamus;</hi> 
                     <q>To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, ſignifieth not only with our eyes to behold it; but ſo to ſtir up our minds to the conſideration of a thing, that we may grow the better by it, (ſaith a grave <hi>Author).</hi>
                     </q> Now in this Notion of it, how few are they that obſerve <hi>theſe things?</hi> they ſee ſtupendious Providences, ſometimes, in the deſtruction of the Churches Enemies for the ſalvation of his people: it may be at firſt they (as all new things do) affect men with a little paſſion, according to the nature of them; but they are like a <hi>flaſh</hi> of <hi>lightning,</hi> which though at preſent it ſtartles us, yet the impreſſion is preſently off our ſpirits: and I ſay, this is one great reaſon why we are ſo ignorant of God, ſo unskilful in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our lives to his ends, and that we underſtand ſo little of his loving-kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, <hi>that we cannot underſtand how much good God doth his Church, and people by afflictions and trials.</hi> They are the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible frowns of Providence which blind our eyes, that we cannot ſee the loving-kindneſs of God in all his ways. We think ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we ſee God driving his Chariot in a direct road to his great ends, the glory of his holy Name, and the good and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch as fear him, here we think we can eaſily diſcern Gods Wiſdom, and as eaſily underſtand his loving-kindneſs: But now
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:192227:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>when the Lord drives his Chariot out of our ſight, and exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Church, or the particular ſouls of his people with long and tedious Afflictions, here we are at a loſs, and can neither read the wiſdom nor loving-kindneſs of God. But what is the reaſon of this, but only our ſuperficial view of Gods Providences with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wiſt, and diligent obſervation of them. If we would but bend our minds, to obſerve what a wholſom influence Afflictions and adverſe Providences have ordinarily both upon vvhole Churches, and upon particular Chriſtians, we ſhould even in them eaſily underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord. The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can eaſily underſtand that he could as ill want the froſts and ſnows of Winter, as the warmth, heat and ſun-ſhine of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>Gideon</hi> taught the <hi>men of Succoth with briars and thorns:</hi> and God ordinarily doth ſo teach his people. <hi>Bleſſed is he</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt), whom thou chaſteneſt and teacheſt out of thy Law. David</hi> tells us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.61, that <hi>before he was afflicted, he went aſtray;</hi> but ſince that he had learned to <hi>keep the ſtatutes of the Lord.</hi> It was an old ſaying, <hi>The blood of the Martyrs is the ſeed of the Church.</hi> The Church is bettered, and the Soul is bettered by adverſe Providences. That Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9, is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: <hi>By this</hi> [that is, by this ſevere affliction, by this captivity] <hi>ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged: and all the fruit ſhall be to take away ſin, when the Lord ſhall make the ſtones of the altar as chalk ſtones that crumble in pieces, the groves, and the images ſhall not ſtand up.</hi> As an hard Winter keepeth under, and killeth the weeds: ſo the winter of Affliction much helps to the purging out of corruptions, both out of the Church, and alſo out of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Soul. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (as I remember) ſomewhere lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>That a Fever had done more with him to ſubdue, and mortifie a luſt than before the love of God could do with him.</hi> Now I ſay, our not obſerving this, which is matter of no difficult obſervation to him that wiſtly eyeth Divine Providence, is one great reaſon, that men do not underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon of mens not underſtanding it, is <hi>their making of a judgment of Gods works before they are perfect.</hi> If any of us ſhould go into a Limners ſhop, and ſee his firſt draught of a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly picture; we ſhould diſcern little lovelineſs in it, which yet we ſhould eaſily diſcern if we would but ſtay until he had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his work, and laid on his life-colours. It is the ſame caſe with us as to works of Divine Providence; we look on them while the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:192227:107"/>Lords work is yet upon the wheel, we ſee nothing in it that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth God the great workman: we ſee in it nothing of the Divine Wiſdom, poſſibly nothing of the divine goodneſs and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindneſs; but could we have patience till the Lords work came off the wheel, we ſhould eaſily ſee it in quite another repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation: we often ſee in Gods works of Providence nothing but confuſion, and blood, and trouble, and multiplied troubles, and diſturbances to thoſe who moſt fear him, and deſire to walk moſt cloſely with him: <hi>But in the evening of that day</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.6,) <hi>it ſhall be light.</hi> The day neither light nor dark, but in the Evening it ſhall be light. Gods peoples days ſometimes are plainly darkneſs, thick darkneſs: but would we have patience to the evening of them, we ſhould ſee light. The Evening is the cloſe and making up of the day. When God cometh to cloſe up his days work, did we but obſerve <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> we ſhould eaſily underſtand that it would be light. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may be for a night, but joy ſhall be in the morning. So as I ſay again, This is one great reaſon, why at all times we cannot underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord to his Church and his people, becauſe we do not obſerve the motions of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but take only a ſlight and ſuperficial view of them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe with an Exhortation to the duty of the Text, The <hi>obſervation of the motions of Divine Providence.</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> In my laſt diſcourſe I diſcovered to you, ſome unſearchable things in Divine Providence, and cautioned you againſt too curious an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into them: My buſineſs now is to call upon you, <hi>non caecutire in revelatis,</hi> not to be blind as to thoſe things which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. This alſo is your duty as well as the other: by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer you acquit your ſelves from an unwarrantable curioſity, by this from a wretched unthankfulneſs. The Providence of God is daily working, in order to the fulfilling of Gods great end, the glorifying of his great and holy Name, the eſtabliſhing of his people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Do not reſt in a meer view of what is done in the World, but fix your eyes upon it.</hi> Lay up the things in your heart, let your thoughts dwell upon them, the remarkable paſſages of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially. You ſee and hear of Wars, and rumours of Wars, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations, fires, changes, and over-turning in Nations; of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Dominions: you at preſent underſtand not the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:192227:108"/>and indications of them, you cannot make up a judgment of them, and prophecy what will and ſhall be from them; but yet obſerve them, lay up theſe things in your minds, yea, and let them not paſs out of your minds: as we are to <hi>hear for the time to come,</hi> ſo we are to <hi>behold</hi> and <hi>obſerve</hi> the motions of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with a reſpect unto a time to come too. Do not think, you can expound every Providence preſently; the <hi>viſion</hi> oft-times is <hi>for an appointed time,</hi> and is to be expounded by time; in the mean time, only to be diligently marked and obſerved, taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of as a great work of God, the meaning of which we ſhall underſtand hereafter. Divines ſay, That the meaning of many Providences, and our clear underſtanding of them, is one of thoſe things wherein our knowledg ſhall be bettered and perfected in the day of Judgment; and till that time, when the hidden things of God, as well as of men ſhall be made manifeſt, we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to <hi>know but in part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do not ſecondly obſerve meer <hi>ſingle acts of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but let your Eye follow it in its motions.</hi> God ſometimes hath his works a long time upon the wheel, eſpecially thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to his Church. I will give you two famous inſtances: 1. <hi>The eſtabliſhing of his ancient Church of the Jews in Canaan.</hi> The promiſe was out for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12, to <hi>Abraham;</hi> it was more than five hundred years, before this work was off the wheel of Providence: four hundred years before they went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they were in bondage; forty years they travelled in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, then during all the time of the Judges: yea, and in <hi>Sauls time too,</hi> they were but in a very unquiet condition. In <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time, they came to a ſetled eſtate in the promiſed Land. There was a Promiſe given out unto Chriſt, for having <hi>the ends of the earth for his poſſeſſion: David</hi> mentioneth it; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſieth much of it. After this <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes, was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it was three hundred years after this, before theſe Promiſes had any conſiderable accompliſhment. Indeed as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, their beings are of ſhorter duration, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God brings about the promiſes to them, in much ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter periods, or they could ſee nothing of <hi>Gods loving-kindneſſes</hi> in the iſſues, or contextures of them: but take heed there of reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Eye upon the obſervations of ſome ſingle acts of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence relating to them; thoſe who ſhould thus have obſerved the motions of Providence with reference to <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:192227:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>David, Daniel, Job,</hi> would have ſeen little of that loving-kindneſs of the Lord to them, which yet is evident enough to all that keep their Eye upon their ſtory, to the winding up of their bottoms. Now to this obſervation of Providence, you have two great Arguments in the Text: 1. <hi>It is an Indication of ſpiritual Wiſdom.</hi> A wiſe man looketh not only at preſent things, but at things paſt, and yet to come. Now Wiſdom is a lovely thing; <hi>It is juſtified of her children</hi> (ſaith our Saviour). Every man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth the reputation of a wiſe man, and ſtudiouſly avoideth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a fool. Two things ſpeak a fool: 1. <hi>To obſerve and mind nothing.</hi> Or 2dly, Meerly to <hi>take notice of things preſent,</hi> and gather concluſions from them. 2. <hi>Thus you ſhall underſtand the loving-kindneſs of God.</hi> Then you will ſee that all the paths of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Church, are mercy and truth. <hi>Truth,</hi> not a word fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the promiſe; and <hi>mercy,</hi> working for the good of them that love God: yea thus, you that fear the Lord ſhall underſtand the loving-kindneſs, and truth of God to your particular ſouls. A thing, the evidence of which is, and ought to be of more value to you than the whole World. I will conclude my Diſcourſe by giving you three Cautions to direct your obſervation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Obſerve the Providence of God, when it ſeemeth to move con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Word; but never determine the Indication of it without the Word.</hi> Indeed, the Providence of God never moveth contrary to the Word, it is always a ſervant to ſome Declaration of the will of God, in ſome promiſe, or threatning, but it often ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to us to move contrary: which made the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> cry out, <hi>Doth the promiſe fail for evermore?</hi> The reaſon of this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that deceiveth us, is our imperfect knowledg, or underſtanding of the Word of God, and non-acquaintance with the Counſels of God, and contrivances of his Wiſdom, and the variety of thoſe deſigns which he carrieth on at the ſame time. God deſigns to bring the <hi>Jews into Canaan;</hi> but a-long with this to carry on the deſtruction of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Amorites</hi> (whoſe ſins in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> time were not come to the full): the deſtruction of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious and diſobedient amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Now in order to this, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> muſt ripen themſelves for their ruin, by their oppreſſion of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> The <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and <hi>Amorites,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations by their falling upon them at their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in their journey. Now upon theſe accounts, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God</hi> often ſeemed to move quite contrary to the word
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:192227:109"/>of Promiſe. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the Red-ſea, and in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, looked very unlike a people that ſhould have a quiet poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Canaan:</hi> Therefore I ſay, Providence is to be obſerved in its Motions, which ſeem contrary to the Word; but the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of it are only to be determined from the Word. God hath appointed wicked men to ſlaughter; notwithſtanding this we ſee moſt vile and wicked men, thriving, proſpering, growing great in the World, and trampling the righteous ſervants of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their foot. Obſerve this, but take heed of determining the Indication of this but from the Word, which ſaith, <hi>There is no peace to them:</hi> keep therefore thine Eye upon their Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, and thou ſhalt ſee the Lords Sun go off it, and the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning verified.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Compare preſent Providences with thoſe that are paſt.</hi> As thoſe who will <hi>underſtand the letter of Scripture,</hi> muſt compare <hi>Text with Text:</hi> ſo thoſe who will be wiſe by underſtanding the motions of <hi>Providence,</hi> muſt compare <hi>Providences</hi> of a preſent age, with <hi>Providences of former ages.</hi> Thou art offended poſſibly at the Providences of God towards wicked men: they thrive and proſper, they grow mighty and encreaſe, and do what they liſt. Or at the Providences of God towards thoſe, who (if thou canſt judg) are ſuch as walk cloſeſt with God, and are moſt ſevere worſhippers and ſervants of him: they are hated, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, expoſed to all manner of injuries, which may make their lives bitter to them. Thou cryeſt out here, <hi>O the depth!</hi> I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ways of God, I cannot ſee his loving-kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people. Compare now (Chriſtian!) Gods dealing in thy age with his dealings both with wicked men, and with his ſincere ſervants in former ages, and ſee if they be not much alike with what they were: In <hi>Jobs time,</hi> and <hi>Davids time,</hi> and <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah's time.</hi> Yet it is not hard for thee to underſtand how the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God in thoſe times found the loving-kindneſs of God, and experienced that all the ways of the Lord were <hi>mercy and truth:</hi> believe that the Hand of the Lord is not weakned, nor his Arm ſhortened, nor his Truth failed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, If you would by obſerving the Providence of God underſtand his loving-kindneſs, and gain a <hi>ſpiritual wiſdom, Let your eye affect your heart.</hi> I hinted to you before, that <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerus</hi> telleth us, ſuch an obſervation of Providence is here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>unde ad pietatem exuſcitemur, ut inde meliores evadamus,</hi> as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:192227:109"/>will quicken us unto piety, and help to make us better. There are <hi>many careleſs obſervers of Providence,</hi> that indeed ſee Events rather than Providences; they ſee much that comes to paſs in the World, but conſider nothing of God in them: they ſee <hi>great fires</hi> laying populous Cities waſt, and poſſibly ſee a <hi>villain</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the firſt coal to them, or a careleſs perſon accidentally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning them; but they do not ſee God, throwing ſuch a wretch off his hand of reſtraint, nor blowing the coals that turn the Cities into aſhes, by his winds, which men could not cauſe. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are curious <hi>obſervers of Providences:</hi> theſe are wonderfully buſily employed in ſearching out the <hi>natural cauſes</hi> of ſuch <hi>thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, lightnings, inundations, devouring peſtilences,</hi> &amp;c. They do by the book of Providence, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complain'd of himſelf, that in his unregenerate ſtate he did by the book of Scripture; he rather brought to it <hi>diſcutiendi acumen,</hi> than <hi>diſcendi pieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> So men bring to the great Works of God rather an acute Eye, and wit to find out the immediate cauſes, and reaſons natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or political, than a <hi>trembling, humble</hi> heart, that they might learn by them more to acknowledg, <hi>love, fear, adore,</hi> and revere the great and mighty God whoſe works theſe are: let not yours be ſuch an obſervation; but let your Eye beholding God in his providential Diſpenſations, affect your hearts with that adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and veneration, that love and fear of the great and mighty God, which ſuch works of God do call to you for.</p>
                  <p>But for the further hopes and conſolation of the people of God in their ſtates of affliction, I intend to commend to you ſome principal Obſervations upon the motions of Divine Providence; which ſhall be the work (if God pleaſeth) of ſome ſucceeding Exerciſes.</p>

                  <p>I Am diſcourſing concerning Divine Actual Providence, as the Object of good mens <hi>obſervation.</hi> I ſhewed you in my laſt Diſcourſe, That the obſervation of the motions of it, is both an <hi>Indication</hi> of ſpiritual Wiſdom, and an excellent ſtep towards it; and that by it duly made, men and women ſhall underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord. Now to advantage you a little in this Obſervation, I ſhall give you an account of ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable things in the motions of Providence, which poſſibly you may parallel in the preſent or future dealings of God, both with his Church, and with particular Souls. I ſhall lay down my firſt Obſervation thus:</p>
                  <p>1. Obſerv. <hi>The Actual Providence of God, in bringing about that word to which it is a certain ſervant, doth rarely move in a direct line, but ſometimes obliquely, ſometimes to our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance quite contrary: but at laſt it fulfilleth the word, and is all the while faithfully executing the Eternal Counſel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three things in this Obſervation, each of which I will open in a few words, and then endeavour to juſtifie the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation by particular inſtances: after which, I ſhall give you ſome reaſonable account of it, and then make ſome ſhort Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
                  <p>Firſt (I ſay), <hi>The Providence of God, is a certain ſervant to the word:</hi> the word either of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> or of <hi>Threatning;</hi> for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:192227:111"/>ſerveth to the execution of them both: <hi>As we have heard, ſo have we ſeen in the City of our God,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 48.8: the Promiſe is but <hi>providentia occultata,</hi> and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is but <hi>promiſſio explicata,</hi> the Promiſe fully explained and opened: and this is no more than you ſhall find recognized by the holy Servants of God, both in all their thankſgivings for mercies they had received, and in all their humiliations upon any judgments, which the Lord had brought on them, as alſo in all the Narrative parts of Scripture, declaring any great motions of Providence: how often do you meet with it in the Goſpel, ſuch or <hi>ſuch a thing was done,</hi> that it might be fulfilled, <hi>which was ſpoken by the Prophet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.12, <hi>He hath confirmed his word which he hath ſpoken againſt our Judges,</hi> &amp;c. which way ſoever Providence worketh; whether in a way of ſenſible good, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible evil, againſt any perſons, people, or places, it is purſuant to, and in fulfilling of ſome word of God.</p>
                  <p>But (ſecondly), I ſay, it moveth not always, yea <hi>it moveth ſeldom in a direct line, in order to the fulfilling of that word to which it is a Servant;</hi> and here I ſhall take notice of three things obſervable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Ordinarily at firſt it ſeemeth to move directly towards the end which we have in our eye:</hi> this you will better underſtand by and by, when I come to give you inſtances in the proof of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes it moveth <hi>obliquely,</hi> ſeeming to be driving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother deſign.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes to our appearance <hi>directly contrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thirdly, I ſay at laſt <hi>it comes home to the Promiſe:</hi> and ſo lets us ſee, that all the while it hath been but a faithful ſervant to the Counſel of God. But I ſhall make you underſtand this bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the inſtances, by which I ſhall in the next place endeavour to juſtify and eſtabliſh the Obſervation, to which I now come, and ſhall particularize in four or five inſtances:</p>
                  <p>The firſt inſtance I ſhall give of it, ſhall be <hi>that great work of Divine Providence,</hi> in bringing the <hi>poſterity of Abraham</hi> into a quiet poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> The Promiſe went out from God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2, <hi>I will make of thee a great Nation, and I will bleſs thee, and make thy name great; and unto thy ſeed will I give this Land.</hi> This Promiſe was given out to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when the World was little more than two thouſand years old: It was above two hundred years after this that <hi>Jacob</hi> with his Family
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:192227:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>(not exceeding ſeventy perſons) went down into <hi>Egypt:</hi> How ſlowly did the Providence of God move as to that part of the promiſe, which concerned the multiplication of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. After the giving out of the Promiſe, <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt fleeth into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> for the Famine: <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.12, You have him again returned into <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 13.18. He is told, that notwithſtanding this Promiſe, his ſeed ſhould be ſervants in a Land that was not theirs. <hi>Ver.</hi> 16, <hi>But in the fourth generation they ſhall come hither again. Abraham dieth,</hi> ſeized of this good Land: <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſucceeds him, and dies there too. <hi>Jacob</hi> firſt is forced to flee to <hi>Padan-aram:</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, he is compel'd by the Famine to go down into <hi>Egypt;</hi> where after his and <hi>Joſephs</hi> death, the poſterity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> for the multiplication of which the promiſe was out ſo many years before, was attempted to be diminiſhed, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all acts imaginable. The <hi>Midwives</hi> are practiſed with to ſtifle their Infants in the birth: when that will not do, others muſt be employed to throw the Males into the River; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are afflicted with the higheſt degree of oppreſſion. At length, the <hi>Providence</hi> of God begins to turn toward the Promiſe. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are allowed to come away: but they had gone but a little way, but they ſee the Red-ſea before them, the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> behind them: one would have thought that now they had been far enough from any proſpect of <hi>Canaan. Providence</hi> by a miraculous operation brings them over this Mountain of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but whither do they come? into a long and howling Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: one while they are aſſaulted with Famine, vvant of Bread, then of Meat, another time with drought; then again aſſaulted with Enemies, ſet upon with fiery flying Serpents; at laſt they come within proſpect of the deſired Land: But on the ſudden for their murmuring, are turned back to forty years wandering. When they get over <hi>Jordan,</hi> they meet with ſeven Nations more ſtrong and mighty than they, who muſt all be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued before they could have poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan:</hi> at laſt, the <hi>Providence of God</hi> comes home to the Promiſe; <hi>Joſhuah</hi> their Captain having firſt conquered the Land, divides it amongſt them: yet after this they were far from a quiet poſſeſſion of it; all the time of the <hi>Judges,</hi> or indeed till <hi>Saul, or Davids time.</hi> What ſtaange circulations, and windings of Divine Providence were here in the accompliſhment of the Promiſes? how little to an humane Eye the Providence of God ſeem'd to mind the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:192227:112"/>
                     <hi>of multiplying Abrahams ſeed for</hi> above two hundred years? <hi>Abraham</hi> had but one Son of the promiſe; and that when he was very old and paſt hopes of children. <hi>Iſaac</hi> had but one nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was an heir of the Promiſe, that was <hi>Jacob: Jacob</hi> had indeed twelve, and theſe in the remaining ſpace of that time were multiplied but to ſeventy (beſides <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt),</hi> how quite contrary to the <hi>Promiſe</hi> did <hi>Providence</hi> ſeem to move all the while that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in <hi>Egypt?</hi> yea and after too, how often would one have judged that the people gueſſed right? when in their impatience they complained, that God had brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to deſtroy them in the Wilderneſs; yet at laſt Gods work was done, <hi>Providence</hi> faithfully ſerved the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and gave a Being to the Word of the Lord given out, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let the ſecond inſtance be that of <hi>Joſeph. Joſeph</hi> had a promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37; I know it was a dream, but it was the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods will to him in that dream; That there ſhould come a time, when all his Fathers houſe ſhould bow to him: all their ſheaves ſhould bow down to his. Now obſerve how <hi>Providence</hi> moveth in bringing this Word of the Lord to paſs. <hi>Joſeph is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his brethren,</hi> hardly eſcapeth with his life; at length is ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and into <hi>Potiphars</hi> houſe; here now he was brought to Court, but no ſooner doth he grow into Reputation, that there was any appearance of his riſing to any degree of Dignity, that might look towards a fulfilling of the promiſe; but he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by his Miſtris, thrown into priſon, like enough to loſe his life; but after this Providence turneth again, raiſeth him to a great degree of Dignity; makes him the ſecond man in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and what God had told him in his dream, was all fulfilled: his Father and his Brethren, all come and bow down to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third inſtance ſhall be that of <hi>David, the promiſe of the Kingdom,</hi> was given out to <hi>David</hi> in the day, when <hi>Samuel</hi> by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from God anointed him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. In the 17th Chap. The <hi>Providence</hi> of God ſo ordereth it, that <hi>Saul</hi> having made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, That if any man would encounter <hi>Goliah,</hi> the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> who defied the Armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he ſhould have his Daughter to Wife. <hi>David</hi> coming to the Army, accepts his Challenge, fighteth, and ſlayeth him, and obtaineth <hi>Sauls daughter. Jonathan Sauls</hi> Son, taketh a great kindneſs to him, the people admire him: Here now the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, at firſt ſetting out, moves as if <hi>David</hi> ſhould preſently have <hi>come to the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:192227:113"/>Kingdom:</hi> but after this <hi>Saul</hi> falls out with <hi>David,</hi> uſeth all arts to take away his life, purſueth him with an Army from place to place: <hi>David</hi> had a pitiful company with him, is forced to flee to <hi>Gath,</hi> there to diſſemble himſelf mad; would any one have thought that had ſeen <hi>David</hi> among the <hi>Philſtines,</hi> ſcrambling on the walls, that he ſhould ever have been King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah?</hi> At length <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> (the next heir) are ſlain in Battel; then <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> is ſet up: but yet after all theſe oblique and ſeemingly contradictory motions of Providence, it cometh home to the promiſe. <hi>David</hi> is ſetled in the Throne of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let a fourth inſtance be <hi>that of the Goſpel Church:</hi> God had promiſed, that <hi>he would ſet his King upon the holy hill of Zion. Pſalm</hi> 2.6. <hi>v.</hi> 8, <hi>That he would give him the heathen for his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion:</hi> and promiſes of this nature are everywhere multiplyed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (<hi>Iſaiah</hi> eſpecially). Our Lord, when he aſcended up into Heaven, gave out a Commiſſion to his Diſciples in order to this effect: <hi>Go preach and baptize all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. Now at the firſt, the Providence of God ſeemed to move as if the thing ſhould preſently have been done. You read <hi>Acts</hi> 2, <hi>That the Spirit of God deſcended: and there were then at Jeruſalem</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>devout men of every Nation under Heaven: Parthians, Medes, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamites, Meſopotamians, Jews, Cappadocians,</hi> men of <hi>Pontus, Aſia, Phrygia, Pamphilia, Egypt, Lybians, Cyrenians, Romanes, Cretes, Arabians,</hi> and heard the Apoſtles in their own language, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great works of God. Here were now Preachers made for all the World: would not one have thought that ſurely at this time, all the ends of the Earth ſhould have been given unto Chriſt? <hi>Peter</hi> at one Sermon converts <hi>two thouſand:</hi> ſoon after there were <hi>five thouſand</hi> added to the Church. But all on the ſudden the Providence of God turneth, the Goſpel groweth out of repute, and the Apoſtles that preached it too, both with <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles. James</hi> is put to death, <hi>Peter</hi> hardly eſcapes. The Church (the only Goſpel church God had at that time) at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was ſcattered and broken: the Apoſtle complains, That <hi>they were made as the filth of the world, and as the off ſcouring of all things.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> perſecute them, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in all places riſe up againſt the Preachers of the Goſpel: <hi>bonds, ſtripes,</hi> and <hi>impriſonments,</hi> waited for the Apoſtles in all places where they
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:192227:113"/>came: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he thought, that <hi>God had ſet them forth as men appointed unto death; ſpectacles to the World, Angels and men.</hi> Few of the great Miniſters of the Goſpel died their natural death; the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were <hi>a ſect everywhere ſpoken againſt;</hi> all courſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt imaginable taken to root them out of all places for three hundred years together. But at length, the Providence of God cometh in a great meaſure to work up to the direct fulfilling of the many promiſes of this nature. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> an Emperour of a great part of the World, ariſeth and commandeth, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the preaching of the Goſpel. And thus it came to be ſpread, and accepted in moſt known parts of the World. Indeed, there is hardly any inſtance can be given of any great work of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, reſpecting Churches, Nations, or particular perſons, as to which this Obſervation will not juſtifie it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For another inſtance may we not bring in, if not all, yet very many of your particular Souls, who fear the Lord. You alſo upon <hi>believing</hi> receive the promiſes: The promiſes are made of old, but we <hi>receive them:</hi> we come to have a title to them, in the day when God opens our eyes, and opens our hearts to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, turning our hearts from dead luſts and ſins to ſerve the living God. In that day, I ſay, we have a firſt right to all the Promiſes, whether reſpecting joy, and peace or ſpiritual ſtrength and aſſiſtances. Now very-often at the firſt of our converſion, the Providence of God moves directly towards them: the Soul finds a great life to Duty, a great zeal againſt ſin, great joy and peace in believing, glimpſes of the glory of God. But after this very ordinarily follow very dark hours, and the Soul like <hi>Jonah</hi> cryes out of the <hi>belly of Hell.</hi> The Soul that <hi>feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his Servant, yet walketh in the dark, and ſeeth no light,</hi> cryeth out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and hath a thouſand fair and foul days in its journey to Heaven. I know particular caſes muſt here be excepted: but I ſpeak of the ordinary Methods of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, with Souls whom God bringeth to glory.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I will conclude this Diſcourſe with the inſtance of the great work of <hi>Providence</hi> in the <hi>Reformation of his Church</hi> in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter age; whether you look upon it in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> or <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> In <hi>Germany</hi> it began with <hi>Luther</hi> (an eminent Servant of of God, though like <hi>Elias</hi> of like paſſions and infirmities with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men): how ſtrangely did the Providence of God in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:192227:114"/>work towards the accompliſhment of it? That <hi>Luther,</hi> who was a poor <hi>Monk,</hi> ſhould be preſerved to plant the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and ſhould diffuſe it ſo far as he did, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to do it againſt all the rage both of the <hi>Pope, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> 28, or 29 years, was a great favour of Providence to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantile Reformation: but afterwards, how the Providence of God gave check to it is ſufficiently known, yet it kept its ground and gained. For <hi>England</hi> we know from our ſtory, That King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8, laid the <hi>firſt ſtone;</hi> we alſo know how Providence at firſt favoured the work, during all the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>ſixth;</hi> but in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> time, for five years together it ſeemed to move directly croſs; the Popiſh Superſtitions were reſtored in all parts of the Nation, Multitudes burnt for the profeſſion of the Goſpel, others fled into foreign parts to ſecure their lives. But the Providence of God returned again to its work in the time of <hi>Queen Elizabeth.</hi> But I have ſpoken enough to juſtifie the Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>Let me in the next place endeavour to give you a reaſonable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe tranſverſe motions of <hi>Providence:</hi> not that I dare preſume to give you the reaſons why God moveth thus, or thus; for who hath been his Counſellor at any time? but ſo far forth, as to ſhew you that theſe motions of Providence are approvable to our Reaſon, ſo as we may judg the Lords ways but propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to his wiſe and great deſigns.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, certainly one reaſonable account to be given of theſe motions, muſt be <hi>the variety of deſigns which the Providence of God ordinarily carries on together.</hi> I have hinted this to you before; ſuffer me here to enlarge a little upon it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. I then compared <hi>Providence</hi> to a man of great buſineſs, and dealings in the World; who though <hi>London,</hi> or ſome other great place, be in his Eye as the end of his Journey where his buſineſs lies, which he doth chiefly deſign the diſpatch of; yet hath alſo other buſineſs here, and there, at this Town and that Town; and therefore ſeldom or never keepeth a road long. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> is Gods great <hi>Miniſter of State,</hi> upon the hand of which all the effects of his Counſels and Eternal purpoſes lie, and it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver driveth a ſingle deſign. The Promiſe was gone out, for the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to inherit <hi>Canaan: Providence</hi> is to bring this about, but this cannot be done till the Nations be diſpoſſeſſed, and in order thereunto the iniquities of the <hi>Amorites muſt be full,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:192227:114"/>Gen.</hi> 15.16: and God giveth <hi>Abraham</hi> this very reaſon, why his ſeed ſhould not poſſeſs <hi>Canaan</hi> until the fourth Generation. God had deſigned to get himſelf glory upon <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> in order to this he muſt firſt oppreſs, then purſue <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the Red-ſea. The <hi>Providence</hi> of God never carrieth on a ſingle deſign, but in the fulfilling ſome eminent Counſel of God, referring to a perſon or a Nation, effects an hundred other pieces of Divine Counſel; although it may be to us not ſo remarkable, as that which our Eye is ſo much upon, and which we are ſo impatient for. The <hi>Providence</hi> of God will bring <hi>David</hi> to the Kingdom; but in order to it, it muſt alſo execute Divine Vengeance upon <hi>Saul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The ſeemingly oblique, and contradictory motions of Divine Providence, do often</hi> (though we at firſt diſcern it not) <hi>bear the notion, and have the nature of proper means in order to the great End.</hi> If <hi>Joſeph</hi> had not been <hi>ſold into Egypt,</hi> if there he had not been thrown into a priſon, how ſhould he have been of uſe to ſave much people, and particularly his Father, and his Brethren alive? It was in priſon that he had the opportunity to interpret firſt the Butlers dream, who recommended him to the King, and brought him before him to interpret his alſo, which you know was his riſe to his great capacity. It was the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> affliction and oppreſſion in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which made them willing to leave the <hi>fleſhpots, and Onions, and Garlick,</hi> there to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Canaan.</hi> We uſe to ſay, <hi>The furtheſt way about, is the neareſt way home.</hi> That man makes it ſo, that doth a great deal of buſineſs in one journey (riding only now and then a little out of the way) which he muſt elſe have diſpatched by new jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys: but it is never truer, than in the motions of <hi>Providence;</hi> what ſeemeth to us in Gods working, the furtheſt way about, in order to the ſaving of a Soul, or the preſerving of his Church and making it to grow and flouriſh, is indeed the neareſt way to it. They ſay, the beating of a Walnut-tree, is the way to make it fruitful: the treading on the <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> the way to make it more flouriſh. We ſee in daily experience the treading down, and trampling a piece of ground, makes it the better in the Spring for graſs or corn; and much ſpareth other <hi>ſtercorations.</hi> It is as trite an obſervation, That <hi>the blood of the Martyrs</hi> hath always <hi>proved the ſeed of the Church. David before he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, went aſtray.</hi> And this many times we can ſay, when a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:192227:115"/>day of Evil is over, though we could not ſo eaſily read it in the hour of his afflictive Diſpenſations either to the Church, or to particular perſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third account of it, may be <hi>Gods deſign to exerciſe the faith and patience of his people.</hi> God hath determined the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinner to deſtruction, and his people to ſalvation; but both of them muſt come to their Eternity by means. The Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the purſuit of his luſts, and a continuance in them; the child of God, by the <hi>exerciſe of his graces.</hi> Amongſt other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of grace, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> are not the leaſt. The exerciſe of theſe is when ſenſe faileth, and the Providence of God moveth out of our ſight, in a time of adverſity when it ſeemeth to move at a great diſtance from the Promiſe, if not directly contrary to it. <hi>Bleſſed are they who have not ſeen, and have yet believed</hi> (ſaith our Saviour). God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a Promiſe, nay divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: two more eminent, the <hi>one of a Child;</hi> the other, of a <hi>numerous ſeed,</hi> and their <hi>inheriting the land of Canaan.</hi> Now if the Providence of God, had preſently moved in a direct line to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fulfilling of theſe Promiſes, where had been a room for <hi>Abrahams faith,</hi> ſo much celebrated in Scripture? the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, That <hi>he againſt hope believed in hope,</hi>— and <hi>ver.</hi> 19, <hi>Being not weak in faith, he conſidered not his own body being now dead, when he was about a hundred years old, nor yet the deadneſs of Sarahs womb.</hi> Ver. 20, <hi>He ſtaggered not at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe through unbelief, but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed, he was alſo able to perform: and therefore it was imputed to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> The <hi>Providence</hi> of God delayeth the time, ſuffereth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> firſt, and his Wife to live to an age, that they both were paſt any reaſonable hope of children, then it giveth him a child: why doth Providence move thus ſlowly, and obliquely? how elſe ſhould <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith have been tried? how ſhould it have been tried whether he would <hi>ſtagger at the Promiſe through unbelief?</hi> Another branch of that Promiſe was, That the child which God ſhould give him of <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife <hi>ſhould be his heir,</hi> Gen. 15.4. This [that is, this <hi>Eliezer of Damaſcus</hi> of whom thou ſpeakeſt, <hi>ver</hi> 2.] <hi>ſhall not be thine heir: but he that ſhall come forth of thine own bowels, ſhall be thine heir.</hi> Chap. 22. God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence tempteth <hi>Abraham;</hi> He bids him <hi>go, and with his own hands ſacrifice this his ſon, his only ſon;</hi> what an oblique, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:192227:115"/>motion of Providence doth this ſeem to be, to the promiſe of <hi>Iſaac</hi> his being the <hi>heir?</hi> In <hi>Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> ſaith the Promiſe. How ſhall that be, when <hi>Iſaac</hi> (who as yet had no ſeed) muſt be ſacrificed? But how elſe ſhall <hi>Abrahams faith and obedience be tried,</hi> which ſtandeth upon Record. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, By faith <hi>Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Iſaac; and he that had received the Promiſe, offered up his only begotten ſon, of whom it was ſaid, In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called; accounting that God was able to raiſe him up from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ead; from which he alſo received him in a figure. Abraham</hi> had a promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> for his ſeed: Providence went a great way about before it ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly came home to this Promiſe; if it had not, how had <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith had its exerciſe mentioned? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. <hi>By faith A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham when he was called to go out into a place, which he ſhould afterward receive, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. By faith he ſojourned in the land of promiſe, as in a ſtrange Country,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God gave him no inheritance in it</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7.5,) <hi>no not ſo much as to ſet his foot on: yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that he would give it to him for his poſſeſſion, and to his ſeed after him,</hi> when as yet he had no children.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What if we ſhould ſay, That God doth this, <hi>that he might be the more admired in the works of his Providence when they came to an iſſue,</hi> and have <hi>the more of the praiſes and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings</hi> of his people. We are never ſo deeply affected either with with the good, or evil that be tideth us, as when we are ſurpriſed with it, and it comes upon us, fearing or looking for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Evils unthought-of are more heavy, and more dejecting and afflictive: Good things not look'd for, are more affecting, and raiſe up holy affections more to the high praiſes of God. Now, when the Providence of God hath moved obliquely, and to our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance quite contrary (as we judged) unto the Promiſe, when it cometh home unto it, to give it a being and iſſue, it cometh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us as it were upon the ſudden, and contrary to the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſenſe and reaſon; and ſo wonderfully affects our hearts, and enforceth from us great and high acknowledgments of the <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> and <hi>power of God,</hi> of his <hi>mercy and goodneſs,</hi> of his <hi>truth and veracity.</hi> It is the common infirmity of our Natures, that we more know our mercies by wanting them, than by enjoying them. If the <hi>Providence</hi> of God moved in a right line to bring promiſed good to them who love and fear God, he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:192227:116"/>would neither have ſo much of the <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>cryes of his people,</hi> during the want of their deſired good, nor yet ſo much praiſe upon the beſtowing of it. You ſhall obſerve, That God is not ſo much praiſed for mercies of common Providence, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every day (how valuable ſoever, as our ſleep in the night, our appetite to our meat, &amp;c.) As for ſuch Diſpenſations as are more rare and extraordinary: the reaſon is, becauſe we look for the former; they are common with us, and we expect them, Providence more ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Particularly, as to Gods great works relating to his Church; God hath uſed to begin a work in one age, which it may be he hath not finiſhed, or will not finiſh till that age be out. Thus you have heard, that it was in the firſt plantation of the Goſpel, begun in the Apoſtles time. Thus it hath been in the <hi>Reformation of the Church</hi> when corrupted; there is nothing more ordinary than this. If therefore you ſee any-where foundations of Reformation laid, and then the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God ſeems to deſert its work, and the foundations laid ſeem to be plucking up again, and all things to run in the old Channels, trouble not your ſelves at it; this is but an ordinary Method of Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>But let us ſecondly from hence collect <hi>what is our duty</hi> with reference to ſuch times, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> when to our appearance the Providence of God ſeemeth to move obliquely, or contrary to the Promiſe. This I ſhall attempt to open to you: 1. <hi>With reference unto God.</hi> 2. <hi>With reference to the Promiſe.</hi> 3. <hi>With reference unto Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Queſt. <hi>What is our duty relating more immediately unto God, under the poſing and aſtoniſhing Diſpenſations of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>

                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:192227:116"/>
                  <p>In the firſt place, we doubtleſs ought <hi>to take heed of charging God fooliſhly.</hi> I borrow the expreſſion from <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 1, <hi>In all this Job ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> To charge God fooliſhly upon the account of his Providences, is by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them to utter vain and fooliſh things that are not fit to be ſpoken of the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of God; as if he failed either in his truth or mercy, or goodneſs to his people. It is an exellent precept of the Apoſtle in this caſe, though given in another: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5, <hi>Judg nothing before the time.</hi> There is a time when God will give us leave to judg of his ways, whether they be not both mercy and truth to them that fear him. Only Judg not before the time, before God hath finiſhed his work, and brought off what he hath upon the wheel. Now it is this haſty Judgment, which is the cauſe of all our murmuring and repining, of all our haſty ſayings, like the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in his paſſion, <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever, and will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? Doth his promiſe fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious, hath he in anger ſhut up his tender mercies, Selah?</hi> Pſalm 77.7, 8, 9. If this be the uſual method of Providence in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Promiſes, to move obliquely and <hi>contrary</hi> (as to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane appearance) and yet at laſt moſt certainly to bring the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to effect; we have no reaſon under the oblique, or ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary motions of Providence, to charge God, as if he failed in his truth, or failed in his mercy; he is only fetching a compaſs in order to the verifying and juſtification of both. For us ſo much as to ſuſpect, or to think the contrary, is to charge God fooliſhly, not obſerving, nor underſtanding the ordinary methods and courſes of Divine Providence in accompliſhing of his greateſt Promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is our duty to <hi>admire God in thoſe providential Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which we do not underſtand.</hi> Man vainly ſtudieth to find out God in his unſearchable Counſels and motions of Providence; <hi>Vain man would be wiſe.</hi> Now the <hi>ways of God</hi> (as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you) are in many things paſt finding out. Where we can fee God in his ways of mercy, there is an opportunity for our love and thankfulneſs: where we cannot ſee him, there is an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for our fear and admiration; ſtand upon this bottom, <hi>That all the ways of God are mercy and truth to them that fear him:</hi> Let nothing ſhake you from this foundation, nor move you from this Rock: where this is not matter of demonſtration to your ſenſe and reaſon, let it yet be matter of <hi>admiration</hi> to you. Be admiring at
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:192227:117"/>the wiſdom of God, that can out of a Chaos bring order, out of darkneſs bring light. But ſecondly,</p>
                  <p n="2">2d Queſt. What (at ſuch a time) is our duty with reference to the Promiſe?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I anſwer to <hi>ſtand faſt by it.</hi> I would have every good Chriſtian think at ſuch a time as Providence (to his appearance) moveth obliquely, and contrary to the Promiſe, to think that he heareth it ſpeak unto him; as Chriſt ſometimes ſpake to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth</hi> 5, <hi>Think you that I am come to deſtroy the law and the Prophets? I am not come to deſtroy them, but to fulfil them.</hi> I ſay, I would have you think you hear the Providence of God thus ſpeaking to you, under its darkeſt Diſpenſations. Think you that I am about to deſtroy the Promiſe, or by my motions to make it of no effect? No, I am come not to deſtroy a tittle of a promiſe: <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but not a tittle of the promiſe ſhall fail:</hi> I am not by theſe motions deſtroying the promiſe; whatever your ſenſe may dictate to you, or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your reaſon may prompt to you, <hi>I am but fulfilling the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi> Therefore I ſay at ſuch a time, look to your hearts that they abide by the promiſe: Let it be the caſe of the Church in which we live, or the caſe of any particular Soul, ſtill keep to the Word, the promiſe to the Church is ſure; the promiſe to the particular Soul is ſure: Providence is not moved out of its way, it is only got a little out of thy ſight; if thou canſt but wait for it, it will come into thy road again, and go with thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation moſt certainly to the fulfilling of the Promiſe. Take that one word, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.12, 13, <hi>Though a ſinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged; yet ſurely it ſhall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him: But it ſhall not be well with the wicked, neither ſhall he prolong his days, which are as a ſhadow, becauſe he feareth not before God.</hi> Conſonant to which is that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.10, 11, <hi>Say ye to the righteous, it ſhall be well with them, for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings: Wo unto the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands ſhall be given him.</hi> Now theſe words both of Promiſe, and of Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, are ſure words; yet ſuch as to which the Providence of God makes our faith ſtagger, more than as to any other. It often goes out of what we take to be its road, in order to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe words: we ſee wicked men proſpering, growing
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:192227:117"/>great in power, honour, riches: yet their ways are ſuch as he that runneth may read, that the fear of God is not before their eyes. Well, be it ſo, yet let not your hearts fail as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, keep cloſe to it: you will ſee Providence return to what you call its Road again. If a Sinner do evil an <hi>hundred times,</hi> if he liveth an hundred years; yet the Word of the Lord ſhall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified upon him. So if a child of God be chaſtened an hundred times; if Religion, and Reformation, and the intereſt of God in the World be brought under the hatches an hundred times: yet <hi>Magna eſt Veritas, &amp; praevalebit,</hi> Truth ſhall prevail at laſt, and Gods people ſhall have the day at laſt. Conſider, O Chriſtian, thou canſt not give God a greater honour, than to believe when thou doeſt not ſeee: This is a faith like <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, who <hi>believed in hope, above hope, or contrary to hope,</hi> Rom. 4: who believed when he had nothing elſe to truſt to, but that <hi>God was able to raiſe up, and ſave from the dead.</hi> Say in the proſperity of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, I will have nothing to do with them: For I <hi>know it ſhall be ill with them;</hi> though they thrive, and proſper ſome months, and years, yet I know the reward of their hands ſhall be given them. In the adverſity and afflicted eſtate of Gods people, ſay, with thoſe will I caſt in my lot, <hi>for I know it ſhall be well with them.</hi> Take heed that the Providence of God draw you not from the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, (will ſome ſay), <hi>What is our duty with reference to Providence at ſuch a time?</hi> I will open this in four or five par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, with which I will ſhut up my Diſcourſe upon this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Search, and ſee whether ſome miſcarriages of thy own, hath not carried Providence out of thy ſight, and turned it out of its right line.</hi> I told you before that Providence is never out of its way: it is always moving upon Gods Errand, but it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of our ſight, and our ſins are the cauſe of that its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You know under what a multitude of Promiſes the <hi>Jews</hi> were, as the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob;</hi> as the <hi>poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of David,</hi> &amp;c. Promiſes for great meaſures of outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; notwithſtanding which they were carried captives into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there endured an hard bondage of ſeventy years. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells them the Reaſon, <hi>Your iniquities have ſeparated betwixt God and you: and your ſins have made him to hide his face from you.</hi> What do the godly amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> under this Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:192227:118"/>
                     <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39, 40, <hi>Let us</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſearch and try our ways, and return again to the Lord:</hi> this is undoubtedly the duty of the Church, the duty of every particular Soul. When thou ſeeſt God turned out of his way, as thou thinkeſt, and not doing by thee as thou didſt expect, ſearch and ſee, whether thy miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages have not cauſed that withdrawing, or turning aſide. It is true, Gods puniſhments of his people are not always for ſin: he may ſometimes do it to try their faith, their patience, their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to him; but this is a ſecret to us.</p>
                  <p>Two things are certain in this caſe: 1. <hi>That God doth moſt ordinarily puniſh them for their ſins.</hi> 2. <hi>That he never puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, but they have ſin'd enough to warrant it an act of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and to give them cauſe of ſuſpicion, and of Soul-humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo as a ſearching and trying of their ways in the day of divine chaſtenings, can never be improper, or out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Look to your faith in the Promiſe.</hi> It is the Promiſe is the object of Faith, and Providence no further than it relateth to the Promiſe. A time of dark Providences is uſually a time of great temptations: It is ſo oftentimes on Gods part, that is, God deſigns his peoples trial. It is ſo often from <hi>Satan,</hi> who takes the advantage of thoſe hours to ſuggeſt to the Soul. It is ſo as to the World; they pierced <hi>Davids</hi> heart in ſuch an hour as <hi>with a ſword,</hi> when in it they ſaid unto him, <hi>Where is thy God become?</hi> Pſalm 42. It is ſo in it ſelf, conſidering that we are but fleſh, and how ready the language of that is, <hi>Surely I have cleanſed my hands in vain, I have waſhed mine hands in innocency for nothing:</hi> Or that of <hi>Saul, This evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait for him any longer?</hi> Therefore, I ſay, Look to your Anchor-hold in ſuch a day. Thus doth <hi>David, Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul? why art thou diſquieted within me? truſt thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God,</hi> Pſalm 42. So doth the Church, <hi>Micab</hi> 7.8, <hi>Rejoyce not over me, O mine Enemy; when I fall, I ſhall riſe; when I ſit in darkneſs, the Lord ſhall be a light unto me.</hi> The Heathen Poets have a ſtory, that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> in his ſailing home, <hi>being to paſs the Syrens,</hi> who were wont to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure Mariners with their melodious tunes towards them, while their ſhips were daſhed in pieces upon Rocks, to avoid the temptation, cauſed himſelf to be tied to the Maſt of his Ship.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:192227:118"/>I would have every Chriſtians heart tied to the Promiſe as to his Maſt, that he might be out of the danger of all temptations from Providence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, (which indeed is a conſequent of this), <hi>Reſolve to wait upon God under all the hidings of his face.</hi> I call'd this a conſequent of the other: for <hi>he that believeth, maketh not haſte</hi> (ſaith the Prophet). This was the Churches reſolution, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17, <hi>I will wait upon him, that hideth his face from the houſe of Jacob.</hi> Temptations in an evil day can have no advantage, but upon our Souls precipitancy. The Soul that is reſolved to wait upon God, hath much defeated all Tempters, and is out of all their Gunſhot. I remember the ſpeech of the three Children to the King of <hi>Babylon, We are not</hi> (ſay they) <hi>careful to anſwer thee in this matter, The God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us out of thy hand: however, we will not fall down before the image which thou haſt ſet up.</hi> If he will not preſently deliver us, we are reſolved to wait on him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To waiting, muſt be added <hi>Prayer: I will look unto him, for he will hear me.</hi> Prayer is the Catholick remedy, both for the averſion of any Judgments, and for the obtaining of any mercy.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, To all this add but that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſalm 37.34, <hi>Wait upon the Lord, and keep his way,</hi> and thou ſhalt inherit the promiſe made to it; <hi>He ſhall exalt thee to inherit the land: and when the wicked are cut off, thou ſhalt ſee it.</hi> But I ſhall proceed no further in this Diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>HAVING ſhewed you it to be the duty of Gods people to obſerve the motions of Divine Providence (which are the things ſpoken of in this Text) and ſhewed you what a great indication of ſpiritual Wiſdom ſuch an obſervation is, and how great a mean, to make us to underſtand the loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord; I came in my laſt Exerciſe to commend unto you ſome remarkable Obſervations concerning them. I finiſhed my Diſcourſe at that time upon my firſt Obſervation, without any further preface I ſhall now proceed to a ſecond, which you may take thus:</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>The Providence of God, in the fulfilling of the words, both of promiſe, and of threatning, doth ordinarily fulfil the firſt, when the people of God are at the loweſt: and the latter, when his Enemies are at the higheſt.</hi> I ſhall handle this in the ſame method as I did the other, ſpeaking to it ſhortly, 1. <hi>By way of Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 2. <hi>Confirming the Obſervation, and giving you the reaſons of it:</hi> and laſtly, making <hi>ſome Application of it.</hi> For Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I muſt deſire you ſtill to obſerve what I before told you, and now repeat, That the Providence of God in all its motions is but a Servant of the Word, it <hi>fulfilleth the will of God:</hi> That it is the ſpring from which all its motions do proceed, both the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> and <hi>revealed will.</hi> The will of God is but one; but part of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:192227:119"/>it <hi>is revealed,</hi> part <hi>concealed.</hi> So much of it as is neceſſary, in order to our Salvation, is revealed, whether reſpecting our rule of life; or reſpecting what ſhall happen to us, or others, to Nations, and Kingdoms, and Churches in this life; or to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Souls in, or after this life. Now what God hath thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, Providence brings to iſſue; and here is the ground both of our <hi>prayers,</hi> and <hi>praiſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Promiſes:</hi> I ſay, you ſhall obſerve, <hi>It is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary method of Divine Providence, to bring them to an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the Church and people of God, when they are at the loweſt in all humane appearance;</hi> in the loweſt ſtate of dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the loweſt degree of affliction; when they are loweſt as to their outward ſtate, loweſt as to their hopes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I added thirdly, That it ordinarily gives a <hi>being,</hi> and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling to the <hi>threatning, when Gods Enemies are at the higheſt.</hi> The people of God are thoſe to whom the promiſes are made: they are the <hi>heirs of them;</hi> they are thoſe to whom are given the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>precious promiſes:</hi> wicked men are they, to whom <hi>the threatnings</hi> belong; they are the children of wrath, the heirs of the Curſes: the work of Providence in reference to them (thoſe of them that will not be reformed) is to bring all the Curſes, that are written in the book of God, upon them. But I ſay you ſhall obſerve, That the time in which the Providence of God fulfilleth theſe words of Threatning upon them, is when they are <hi>at the higheſt;</hi> in the higheſt hopes of the contrary, on the higheſt mountains of proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Let me endeavour to juſtifie this Obſervation by ſome inſtances, and thoſe concerning bodies of people, or individuals. You know the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> were the only people under Heaven until Chriſts aſcenſion, that God owned as his people: Individuals there were that were not <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> and others; but (I ſay) for a body of people there were no other. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, To <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>his ſeed were the Promiſes made,</hi> Rom. 9.4, <hi>Who are Iſraelites: to whom appertained the adoption, and the glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the Promiſes.</hi> The Promiſes made to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob. David,</hi> &amp;c. The Promiſes of <hi>inheriting Canaan,</hi> coming out of <hi>Babylon, deſtroying their Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. Now theſe promiſes being given out, it was the work of Divine Providence to give them a <hi>verification,</hi> and to fulfil them. Obſerve what times the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:192227:120"/>of God doth it in: It bringeth the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and into <hi>Canaan,</hi> not while <hi>Jacob,</hi> or <hi>Joſeph</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a great man, and could have given a probable conduct to that great work. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> while he lived were in a very flouriſhing condition, multiplying exceedingly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a very proſperous ſtate every way. But this is not a time when the Providence of God will accompliſh the Promiſe; <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> muſt die, and another King riſe up that knew not <hi>Joſeph.</hi> The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are diminiſhed, their little ones ſlain, their whole body oppreſſed with hard labour, and brought to as low a paſs as you can well imagine a people to be not wholly blotted out. This is the time that <hi>Providence</hi> will accompliſh the promiſe for their coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> They paſs the Red-ſea in a very formidable body, like enough to make their way through the Wilderneſs, and a variety of Enemies into the promiſed Land. But before the Providence of God brings them in, they muſt be broken, in a great meaſure deſtroyed; all dead unleſs <hi>Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> who came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their body wholly a new generation; then they ſhall paſs over <hi>Jordan.</hi> Read over all the ſtory of <hi>Judges,</hi> and obſerve; God ſeldom delivered them from their oppreſſors, until they were brought as low as could be. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time, when the men of <hi>Jabiſh Gilead</hi> were ready to take the baſeſt terms, then God ſends <hi>Saul</hi> to their reſcue; when there was not <hi>a ſword,</hi> nor <hi>a ſpear found in all Iſrael,</hi> but in the hand of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> then will God deliver them from the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines.</hi> They ſhall be delivered out of the <hi>captivity</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but not till they had been worn out there ſeventy years: when one would have thought ſcarce any ſhould have been left to have returned, and thoſe that were ſo linked with alliances to the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> ſo fixed in another Country, as few of them ſhould ever have been perſwaded to have come out, and have gone to build a new a deſolate City. The promiſe of Chriſt (their great King) ſhall be made good to them: but when? <hi>when the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is <hi>departed from Judah, and the Law-giver from his feet.</hi> When the <hi>Jews</hi> are made tributaries to the <hi>Romans;</hi> for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons the caſes are very many: <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall have the Child of the promiſe, when he is an hundred years old. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhall be exalted <hi>out of a dungeon. Iſaac</hi> ſhall be reſcued, when the knife is at his throat. <hi>David</hi> ſhall have the Kingdom, when he is brought to the loweſt Ebb; and that is the time when <hi>Job</hi> ſhall
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:192227:120"/>be reſtored to a proſperous ſtate, and his latter end ſhall be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his beginning. The three Children, and <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhall be delivered and exalted, but not till the former be actually thrown into the fiery Furnace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Lions Den. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall be delivered out of priſon, but not till the very night before his execution was deſigned. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall be delivered when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of life, and had the ſentence of death in himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. In ſhort, you ſhall obſerve this the conſtant courſe and method of Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The obſervation is as true on the other hand: when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with his Hoſt was in their higheſt ruff; and he ſays, <hi>I will purſue, I will overtake them, I will ſatisfie my luſt on them,</hi> then ſhall he be drowned in the Red-ſea; when the <hi>ſins</hi> of the <hi>Amorites are at the full,</hi> then, and not before, will Providence deſtroy and root them out. When <hi>Siſera</hi> is in his greateſt heighth, then will God by Woman bring him down. When <hi>Sennacherib</hi> is at his heighth, then ſhall he periſh. The like inſtances might be given of <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, Haman;</hi> in ſhort, of all the Enemies of God, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of whom we have any Scriptural record. I remember when <hi>Gideon</hi> had his great Army: God ſaid, they were too many for him to conquer by, and reduceth them to three hundred, then maketh them victorious. The people of God, though under ſome miſery, and oppreſſions may be too many, or in too good a condition for him to deliver them, and the Enemies may be too low, or in too pitiful a condition for the Lord of Hoſts to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them. He will then deal with <hi>Pharaoh, Sennacherib, Haman, Belſhazzar, Herod,</hi> when they are at the higheſt, and think themſelves out of the reach of divine Power and Juſtice. When all the World almoſt is turned <hi>Arian</hi> he will begin to root out <hi>Arianiſm:</hi> When all are made ſlaves to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and he can with his <hi>Bulls</hi> fright the greateſt <hi>Prince;</hi> that is the time Providence will chuſe to begin Reformation. Let us a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Wiſdom of God in this method of working.</p>
                  <p>God in all his great workings, both of Judgment and Mercy, in all his great motions of Providence, is purſuing one and the ſame great end, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of his great and holy Name; he can work for no higher, he will work for no lower, or leſſer end: The deliverance and good of his people is ſubordinate to this, ſo is the ruin and deſtruction of their Enemies; ſo that this muſt be the reaſon of this method of Providence, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> thus <hi>God
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:192227:121"/>is moſt glorified,</hi> by delivering his people when they are at the loweſt; by deſtroying his Enemies when they are at the higheſt, God is moſt glorified. My further Work muſt be to demonſtrate this, <hi>God is thus moſt glorified:</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By a Declaration of himſelf in his glorious Attributes.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By Eliciting pious actions from his Creatures.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By a <hi>Declaration of himſelf:</hi> that men may know that he is God, and he alone; and the work is his, and his alone. There is, as I have told you, a mute Glory, which ariſeth unto God from his own works: as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God.</hi> As all Gods works of Creation, ſo all his works of Providence, declare the glory of God; and he doth them to be had in remembrance, that he might by them be glorified, and get himſelf a great Name in the Earth. God is divers ways emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently magnified, and made known to the World by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Providence in its workings: divers Attributes of his are remarkably by it publiſhed to the World. I will inſtance in ſome: His <hi>power,</hi> his <hi>wiſdom,</hi> his <hi>juſtice and righteouſneſs,</hi> and his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The power of God is thus more magnified.</hi> Power is a great Attribute of God: <hi>Once have I ſpoken</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt), yea twice have I heard it, that power belongeth unto God.</hi> Hence he is ſo often call'd <hi>The great God.</hi> Now the <hi>power</hi> of God, is never ſo eminent in the view of the World, as when he <hi>raiſeth up his people out of the dunghil,</hi> and pulleth down the Sinners in the heighth and pride of their glory. When God falleth upon a <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> crying out, <hi>Who is that God who ſhall deliver you out of my hands?</hi> Dan. 3.15. Upon a <hi>Sennacharib,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Who are they amongſt the gods of the Nations that have delivered their people out of my hand, that the Lord ſhould deliver you out of my hand?</hi> Iſa. 36.20. Upon a <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him?</hi> Exod. 5.2. Then doth the Lord make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his might and power known: God lets them then ſee, that wherein they thought, ſpake, and acted proudly, he can be above them. Power is never ſo magnified, as when an oppoſite power is greateſt, when men moſt think they are out of Gunſhot. I remember the ſtory of <hi>Gideon</hi> (which I hinted before); you have it, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.2. <hi>The people</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>are too many for me,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:192227:121"/>leſt Iſrael vaunt himſelf againſt me, and ſay, my own hand hath ſaved me. Ver.</hi> 3, They were reduced to twenty two thouſand: <hi>Ver.</hi> 4, God ſaith, <hi>They are yet too many for me.</hi> In ſhort, they muſt be brought to three hundred, and by them God will work; here now Gods Arm <hi>was made bare:</hi> when there is a plenty of <hi>means,</hi> and <hi>probabilities,</hi> and God worketh by and in the uſe of them, it is ſtill God's arm that brings Salvation; but it is as it were a <hi>cloathed-arm,</hi> and the arm, the power, and ſtrength of God is hidden and concealed: but when God works contrary to humane probabilities, and without ſuch means, there the arm of the Lord is made bare. The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the vileſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies cry out; God fighteth againſt them, or, <hi>This is the Lords work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the <hi>Power,</hi> ſo the <hi>Wiſdom of God</hi> is ſeen in <hi>theſe methods and operations of Providence.</hi> Indeed, ſometimes God ſo worketh, that the <hi>Power</hi> of God appeareth uppermoſt, and is moſt conſpicuous in the deſtruction of the Enemies, and in the ſalvation of the Lords people: as in the caſe of <hi>Sennacherib's</hi> Army, deſtroyed by an Angel; of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> deſtroyed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But oft-times there's a <hi>wonderful wiſdom</hi> of God in <hi>ordering contingencies,</hi> and ſeeming caſual things, to his own ends in theſe caſes: as in the caſe of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Haman,</hi> the reflexion of the Sun upon the waters, which cauſed the <hi>Moabites</hi> miſtake and confuſion. But the wiſdom of God is further ſeen in this, That a mercy ſeldom comes; but though we could ſee nothing of Wiſdom relating to it before it came, yet when it is come to paſs, there's no underſtanding Chriſtian but is forced to ſay, It could never have come in a more ſeaſonable time: the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of which, we could ſee nothing of in the proſpect, is evident upon the event. It would have been a great queſtion, whether the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would have been ſo willing to have come out of <hi>Egypt</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when they were pinch'd with no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as they were under <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> when they had been ſerving in the Brick-kilns, and their lives ſo many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether had been made bitter to them, through the hard bondage which they had ſo long endured.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Lord doth thus more eminently magnifie his juſtice and righteouſneſs.</hi> Juſtice lieth in the diſtribution of <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>puniſhments:</hi> the firſt we call <hi>Remunerative;</hi> the ſecond <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative Juſtice:</hi> Both are much magnified by this method of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Perſons in the greateſt heighths of proſperity, or <hi>depths

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> are ordinarily the moſt remarkable objects of the worlds eyes, and more regarded than thoſe that are in a more middle-ſtate. When God lifts up a <hi>Joſeph</hi> out of the dungeon, and a <hi>Daniel</hi> out of the <hi>Lions den,</hi> and advanceth a <hi>Mordecai,</hi> for whom a <hi>gallows</hi> was ſet up, and the three Children are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of a fiery Furnace; He proclaimeth to all the World, and they are forced to confeſs it, that <hi>verily there is a reward for the righteous:</hi> and ſo on the other ſide, when a <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> a <hi>Sennecharib,</hi> an <hi>Haman,</hi> a <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> are pull'd down in the midſt of all their pride and jollity, from their very pinacles of honour; the Juſtice and Righteouſneſs of God in puniſhing proud and imperious Sinners, is proclaimed, and made more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to all the World. Laſtly,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The Lords goodneſs is thus more magnified and taken notice of.</hi> Common and ordinary Diſpenſations of gracious Providence, are little remarked by us: what mercy do we receive every night, every day from God, yet how little notice do we take of it? how little is our heart affected with it? but now when we are brought to the pits-brink, to a very low eſtate, and then are pluck'd from it; when we are in a very low eſtate, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; Gods goodneſs is both more proclaimed to the World, and more conſpicuous unto us. But this will in part fall in under the ſecond head: for I told you, that God is glorified by this method of his Providence, not only as his glorious Attributes (divers of them) are by it more exalted; but alſo as the pious and religious Acts of his people, are more by this method of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence elicited. I have often hinted to you, that God hath a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold glory from his Creatures, and the works of his hands: The firſt is a <hi>meer paſſive</hi> glory; Thus <hi>the heavens declare the glory of God;</hi> the Heavens ſhew forth the greatneſs, glory, and power of God. The ſecond is <hi>Active;</hi> wherein the creature doth ſome actions, from which a glory doth reſult unto God. Now by this Method of Providence, God is not only glorified in the firſt ſenſe, as this kind of working ſpeaketh more of his <hi>Power, Wiſdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Goodneſs,</hi> &amp;c. but in the ſecond alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Thus God ſometimes forceth an acknowledgment of his Power, even from the worſt of men. Julian</hi> himſelf ſhall confeſs that Chriſt is too hard for him, throwing up his Dagger to Heaven, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Viciſti Galilaee.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhall cry out, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.25, <hi>Let us flee from the face of Iſrael, for the Lord fighteth for the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:192227:122"/>Iſraelites againſt the Egyptians. Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſhall make a Decree, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.29, <hi>That every Nation, People and Language, which ſpeak any thing againſt the God of Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego, ſhall be cut in pieces, and their houſes ſhall be made a dunghil, becauſe there is no other God that can deliver after this ſort.</hi> Dan. 6.25, <hi>Darius ſhall write to all people; Nations and Languages that dwell upon the Earth,</hi> and make a Decree, <hi>That in every Dominion of his Kingdom, men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for he is the living God, and ſtedfaſt for ever, and his Kingdom that which ſhall not be deſtroyed, and his Dominion ſhall be even to the end: he delivereth, and he reſcueth, and he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſigns and wonders in the Heavens, and in the Earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the Lions.</hi> The King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> that ſet up the Golden-image, and ſo rigorouſly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all ſhould bow down to it, or be thrown into the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, heated ſeven times hotter than ordinary, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.26, <hi>ſhall bleſs the God of Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego, who hath ſent his Angel and delivered his ſervants that truſted in him; and have changed the Kings word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not ſerve or worſhip any god but their own God.</hi> What a wonderful glory here had God given him from a wicked <hi>Pagan Prince?</hi> he confeſſeth his Command wicked; he bleſſeth God that put into theſe three hearts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to diſobey it, and make him change his word; he acknowledgeth God the true God, and that he delivereth them that truſt in him. All this accreweth from Gods delivering theſe three men when they were at the loweſt, when all gave them over for dead men.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, How much more glory hath God from his own people upon any ſuch deliverance? <hi>Surprizals affect us moſt.</hi> An unthought-of evil moſt ſtartleth and dejecteth us: An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought-of good moſt elevates, and affects us. Good things leſſen in our opinion and eſtimate, by a long expectation; They are greateſt and moſt affect us, when we are paſt hopes of them. Sudden and unlook'd for good, raiſeth our hearts to great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, great praiſe, and thankſgiving. Now, <hi>he that offereth praiſe</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>glorifieth me.</hi> The more God is admired, the more his goodneſs is predicated and proclaimed; the more men upon any occaſion ſpeak of his honour, and power, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the more glory God hath from them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God is more honoured by this method of Providence,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:192227:123"/>not only as the ſuddenneſs of it doth more affect and elevate his peoples hearts; but alſo as by it his people are <hi>more prepared for the receiving of mercy.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>He prepareth the heart, and then cauſeth his ear to hear:</hi> their <hi>heart is prepared</hi> by their <hi>exerciſe of grace;</hi> as of other grace, ſo eſpecially <hi>faith and patience;</hi> they become more low in their own eyes, they learn more to truſt and depend upon God, and to wait upon him in the way of his Judgments, as the Prophet ſpeaks. Now all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of grace bringeth glory to God, all of it is the fruit of his Spirit, it is obedience to his Will; it carrieth with it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition of the power, wiſdom, goodneſs and Soveraignty of God. The longer God deferreth a mercy, the more time his people have to ſearch and try their ways, to humble themſelves under the mighty hand of God, to exerciſe their faith, their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the more he hath of his peoples prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I may yet add one thing more: he hath by this means, <hi>the glory of his Juſtice, both from his own people, and from wicked men.</hi> By ſuffering his own people to be brought very low, he proclaimeth to the World, that he will not ſuffer the beſt of them to go unpuniſhed; but as to them he will approve himſelf a <hi>God of purer eyes than to behold any iniquity:</hi> and by letting Sinners run on to the heighth, before he pulleth them down, their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs alſo becomes ſo exorbitant and conſpicuous to the World, that the neutral part of the World, ſhall both acknowledg the righteouſneſs of God, in bringing them down to an utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and delivering of his oppreſſed people out of their hands. But this is enough to have ſpoken in juſtification of the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and giving you ſome reaſonable account of it.</p>
                  <p>This (in the firſt place) <hi>may let us ſee,</hi>

                     <hi>how little means is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the great effects of Divine Providence.</hi> Humane means are by us to be uſed when Providence affords them: but God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily doth his works either without them, or when there is but little of them to uſe: <hi>Not by might, nor by power; but by my Spirit</hi> ſaith the Lord. <hi>The ſtone was cut out of the mountain without hands, which ſmote the image on his feet: which were part of iron and clay, and brake them in pieces,</hi> Dan. 2.34: and indeed, if this Obſervation is true, if God ordinarily delivers his people when they are at the loweſt, and brings down his Enemies when they are at the higheſt, humane means muſt have but a little ſhare in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:192227:123"/>Gods works: when men are at loweſt, there is leaſt viſible means to lift them up; and when God's Enemies are at higheſt, there is leaſt appearance of humane viſible means to pull them down. Now this, as you have heard, is the time when God ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily works, and therefore our eyes ſhould be off the arm of fleſh: What is a Mountain before Gods <hi>Zorobabel?</hi> How little of humane means did God uſe in bringing his people out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon?</hi> There is never greater improbability of any great work of Providence, than in the greateſt probability of humane means. <hi>Gideon</hi>'s twenty two thouſand were too many for God. Let us then learn how to look upon, how to uſe means: Look upon them as ſignifying nothing without Gods efficacy: uſe them as not truſting in them, or to them. Raiſe up no great hopes upon great probabilities in reſpect of them. The people of God are never more deceived, than in their judgments upon ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances. Many times the thing appears too probable to humane eyes, for God to ſuffer it at that time to come to iſſue; he ſhould have little honour, little glory from the effect; if he ſhould give it, men would ſay that God had ſaved them by their own bow, and ſword, and ſtaff. God will have it otherwiſe: <hi>When he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth again the captivity of Sion, his people ſhall be like them that dream,</hi> Pſalm 126.1. He will ſo deſtroy his Enemies, that they ſhall cry out, <hi>Let us flee, for God fighteth for the Iſraelites againſt the Egyptians,</hi> Exod. 14.25. He will ſo bring to paſs all his great works, both of Judgment and mercy, that they ſhall ſing that Song, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 115. <hi>v.</hi> 1, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Name be given the glory.</hi>

When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was in his Ruff, walking in the Palace of the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>Is not this great Babylon that I have built? for the houſe of my Kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Majeſty.</hi> Even then <hi>while the word was in the Kings mouth</hi> (ſaith the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 31) <hi>there fell a voyce from heaven, ſaying, O King Nebuchadnezzar! to thee be it ſpoken, the Kingdom is departed from thee.</hi> A Sinner can be ſecure in no eſtate, at no time: If God hath lifted him up he hath reaſon to fear his ruin is near: If God be pulling him down, he hath reaſon to fear that he is ſinking into Hell. God delights to grapple with a proſpering, fortified, intereſted Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and to let him then when he ſpeaketh moſt proudly, know, that wherein he ſpeaketh proudly, he will be above him. Let not therefore any Sinner truſt to his proſperity.</p>

Not to <hi>envy them:</hi> It is what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> calls to us for, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37.1,—<hi>Neither be thou envious at the workers of iniquity:</hi> And the Wiſeman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.31, <hi>Envy not the Oppreſſor.</hi> Prov. 23.17, <hi>Let not thy heart envy Sinners.</hi> You have an uſual ſaying, It is better to be envied, than pitied: the meaning is, to be in a ſtate of proſperity, which uſually is the Object of Envy, than in a <hi>ſtate of adverſity,</hi> which is uſually the Object of pity: It is not ſo here, It is better to be a child of God, though an Object of pity, than a Sinner, though an Object of Envy. Proſperity ſlayeth the fool, nor is he ever ſo near ruin, as when he is at the higheſt. There is a ſtory of a cuſtom they had in <hi>Perſia,</hi> to gratifie a condemned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, for an hour before his Execution, with whatſoever he
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:192227:124"/>ſhould deſire; which of us ſhould have envied ſuch a poor wretch for that hours pleaſure? Sinners are never ſo near ruin as when they are at the higheſt: O then envy them not in their heighths!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Much leſs <hi>fret, and repine againſt God, for allowing them ſuch a preheminence over thee, as to their outward eſtate.</hi> God hath his wiſe and juſt ends in it, both in ſuffering them to grow high, and thee to continue in a low and afflicted ſtate; by the former, he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth them for Judgment: by the latter, he prepareth you for Mercy. <hi>Fret not becauſe of evil-doers</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſalm 37. <hi>ver.</hi> 1.) We cannot dive into the bottom of Gods Counſels; but if this obſervation of the motions of Providence be true, we may ſee cauſe enough, not to fret our ſelves, nor to murmur and repine at God; we have no reaſon to repine at God, when we ſee his Providence working towards our deliverance, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the downfal of his and our Enemies. Thus it is according to this Obſervation; when we are brought moſt low, and the Enemies of God are ſuffered to mount moſt high.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Certainly</hi> (if this be true) <hi>the flouriſhing ſtate of ſinners ſhould be no temptation to us, ſo much as to deſire to take part with them. Solomon</hi> joins them together, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.31, <hi>Envy not thou the Oppreſſor, neither chuſe any of his ways: My ſon</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) If ſinners entice thee, conſent not thou unto them; though they ſay, we ſhall find all precious ſubſtance, we ſhall fill our houſes with ſpoil.</hi> The words of Sinners are nothing ſo enticing, as their proſperous ſtate; for riches, and honour, and rule, and pleaſures, not many can reſiſt the temptation of them: but certainly, if the heighths of theſe to ſinners be prognoſticks of their ruin; if we could conſider their pride, their riches, honours, plenty, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, as things which ſet them nearer unto ruin, they would be no temptations: deſire not to riſe, and thrive and grow great, and domineer with wicked men, leſt thou alſo fall with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But in the laſt place, let us from hence conclude the duty of a child of God <hi>in his loweſt ſtate,</hi> or in the <hi>loweſt ſtate of the Church and people of God.</hi> I will open it in few particulars, and ſo conclude.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To glory <hi>in Tribulation.</hi> The Apoſtle maketh this one of the fruits of <hi>juſtifying faith,</hi> Rom. 5. St. <hi>James</hi> would have the rich Chriſtian <hi>rejoyce in that he is made low,</hi> Ja. 1.10. A depth
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:192227:125"/>of miſery in the people of God, always makes way for mercy; and the redemption, and ſalvation of the people of God is never nearer, than when in humane appearance it ſeems to be furtheſt off. Indeed, this muſt be the rejoycing of faith, for the eye of ſenſe at ſuch a time is quite put out. Beſides the circulation of Divine Providence, which is evident to thoſe who look wiſtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the motions of Providence in the World; there is a great deal more to give the people of God at ſuch a time cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing: they are more prepared for mercy, their Enemies are more prepared for vengeance; it is then a fit ſeaſon for God to work for his glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This ſhould learn the people of God patience under all their ſufferings, preſſures, and oppreſſions.</hi> Patience is a grace, of which we may ſay as <hi>Solomon</hi> of a Friend, or a Brother: <hi>It is made for adverſity.</hi> There are many arguments to perſwade Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that is, a quiet, calm ſubmiſſion to God under frowns of Providence; but nothing more effectual to our haſty and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient frail natures, than to hear, that the burthen of God upon our ſhoulders ſhall not lie there long: when we can hope that <hi>Nube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula eſt &amp; tranſibit,</hi> it is but a ſtorm, and it will over. What ſaid our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>Could not you watch with me one hour?</hi> The proſpect of the ſhortneſs of an Evil, doth very much alleviate it, and relieve our ſpirits under the burthen of it. That miſerable Emperour had no other relief under his moſt cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than <hi>Hoc non eſt Eternitas;</hi> this is not Eternity. Now what an argument is this for a Chriſtians patience, and fortitude, for him to think when his caſe is worſt, when his burthen moſt pincheth him, then his deliverance is neareſt, even at the door. They ſay in a dark morning, the darkneſs is always thickeſt juſt before break of day. <hi>In the Mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen.</hi> I am ſure it is always darkeſt juſt before break of day with the Church and the people of God. As the pains of a Woman in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel encreaſe, ſo the hour of her delivery more haſteneth; and there is no worſe ſign of a long travail to her, than little and lingring pains. The Women at ſuch a time will ſometimes ſay to thoſe that enquire after the Woman in pangs, <hi>We want more pain.</hi> Truly it is ſo oft-times with the Church of God: They want more pain, more preſſures and oppreſſions, they are not brought low enough for a mercy. O let us be patient then under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt trials: Great trials never laſt long. You know what the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:192227:125"/>
                     <hi>Martyr</hi> ſaid, <hi>We have a bad Dinner,</hi> but <hi>we ſhall have a better Break-faſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This calleth aloud to the people of God at ſuch a time for the exerciſe of faith.</hi> Indeed, this is the proper time for <hi>faith to work.</hi> As too much light blinds the Eye inſtead of helping it, ſo doth ſenſe blind the Eye of Faith: Senſe followeth Providence; but Faith ſtands by the Promiſe, and exerciſeth it ſelf upon that. When the Providence of God is moſt out of our ſight, then is the time to lay the faſteſt hold upon the Promiſe. As there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of darkneſs in nights, ſome are much more dark than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo there are degrees of darkneſs in the Churches nights: ſometimes there is a darkneſs in it which may be felt, when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is ſo far from giving a light to us like that of the Sun, that it doth not give us the light of a Candle. Here now Chriſtians ſtand concerned to ſhew, that they do not live by the light of Providence, but by <hi>faith in the word of God;</hi> which ſtill is the ſame, and abideth for ever. If two be walking together, they had never more need to take heed that they loſe not one anothers company, than in a dark and bluſtring night, when the darkneſs keeps them that they cannot ſee one another: and the wind hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth that they cannot hear the ſound each of others feet. The Believer and the Promiſe are Relates, companions each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: there is never more danger of their being parted each from other, than in a night of dark and bluſtring Providence. Now a Chriſtian ſtands concerned, to be often applying his Soul to the Promiſe: often calling upon his Soul as <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42, <hi>Truſt thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him.</hi> Nor is there any thing more conducive to make a Chriſtian at ſuch a time hang upon the Promiſe, than to hear that it is the uſual method of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence; then to remember Gods people, when they are in the loweſt condition.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>As this calleth to the people of God for faith in the Promiſe,</hi> ſo it calls to them for <hi>hope:</hi> Faith and Hope are ſo near of kin, that they are oft put one for another. Indeed, <hi>Hope</hi> is nothing elſe but Faith <hi>looking out at the windows of the ſoul,</hi> in expectation of the coming of the thing believed. There is an <hi>hope</hi> that worketh upon the encouragements of ſenſe, when the mercy hoped for is ſeen coming in a way of probable means: but there is an Hope that proceedeth meerly upon the Evidence of Faith, when the Soul hopeth for ſome good thing, but ſeeth no
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:192227:126"/>encouragement from any ſenſible thing: the former is but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affection working upon an <hi>abſent probable good;</hi> This latter is a <hi>ſupernatural habit,</hi> and an exerciſe of grace. The Apoſtle calls it an <hi>hoping againſt hope;</hi> or a believing in <hi>hope againſt hope.</hi> This is that which I am calling to you for: This is that which keepeth the heart alive in the deadeſt time. We uſe to ſay, <hi>If it were not for hope</hi> (under evils) <hi>the heart would break.</hi> Faith is the acquieſcence of the Soul in the World: <hi>Hope</hi> is the motion of the Soul conſequent to this acquieſcence. Faith ſaith, the thing is ſure; Hope ſeeth it coming, and relieveth the Soul with that. Hope is the Souls watchman. The Soul cryes out, <hi>Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</hi> Hope ſaith, <hi>The morning is coming.</hi> Now this Obſervation advantageth Hope; It aſſures you, that God is coming at <hi>Midnight. When you ſee theſe things come to paſs</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.28.) <hi>lift up your heads, for the day of your redemption draweth nigh.</hi> It hath reference to all that went before, where our Saviour had been telling them of the great Evils that were to precede his coming. Now, ſaith our Saviour, when you ſee things at this miſerable, deſpicable paſs; <hi>then lift up your heads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This Notion calleth to the people of God for <hi>fervent, and conſtant prayer</hi> for the Church, and people of God, when they are at the loweſt ebb. Never give over the caſe of the Church and people of God for deſperate, it is never leſs ſo than when it moſt appeareth to you to be ſo. I remember it is particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked concerning <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the 9th Chapter of his Propheſie, That <hi>when he underſtood by books that the time was come for the fulfilling of the Jewiſh captivity, then</hi> he made that <hi>excellent Prayer,</hi> which you have upon record in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> with a great deal of <hi>fervor</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> for the people, of which you will find it full. <hi>Daniels</hi> certain knowledg, that that was the time for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, did not ſuperſede his duty of Prayer, but more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly quicken him to it. In ſuch a ſtate of the Church and people of God, as I have been deſcribing to you, a Chriſtian hath two great arguments to perſwade him to a more conſtant, diligent, and fervent application of himſelf to the throne of Grace. 1. The <hi>Churches miſery and low condition,</hi> calling to him for pity, and what help he can give it. 2. <hi>The knowledg he hath, or may have, that it is now about the time, when God uſeth to ariſe and help.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This Obſervation calleth upon all that fear the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:192227:126"/>Lord, eſpecially at ſuch a time <hi>when they, or the Church of God is loweſt, to watch unto holineſs; to wait upon the Lord and keep his way, and to be wary of ſin.</hi> To deter all that fear God from ſinning, eſpecially at ſuch a time, I might mind you of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of God to the <hi>Jews: When the Hoſt goeth forth to battel, then take heed of every wicked thing.</hi> But I ſhall conclude with that known ſtory of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> You know they had an old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made four hundred years before, that <hi>they ſhould inherit the land of Canaan:</hi> they had ſerved in <hi>Egypt</hi> many years, they were now come over the <hi>Red-ſea,</hi> and had encountred, and overcome the long and many difficulties of the Wilderneſs: they were brought within a proſpect of the promiſed Land, nothing wanted, but a taking poſſeſſion: they murmur againſt God, retard their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance forty years, until all that generation was deſtroyed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah.</hi> I ſhall conclude, Hath the Church been a long time under great preſſures, things ſtill as to its intereſt growing worſe and worſe, that they ſeem to be brought to as low a paſs as they can be? Now begins her hope to dawn, according to that Method of Providence which I have obſerved to you: Only now, let the people of God look to themſelves, that by ſome defection they do not ſet back their own mercies. You may take the Exhortation in the words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6, <hi>Now theſe things happened unto them for our enſamples, to the end that we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they luſted: neither be ye Idolaters as were ſome of them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall add no more to this Second Obſervation.</p>

                  <p>I Have both ſhewed you the duty of the people of God, to make Obſervations upon the motions of <hi>Divine Providence;</hi> and the advantage accrewing to them that perform it. 1. It is an indication of ſpiritual Wiſdom. 2. <hi>Thoſe</hi> that do it <hi>ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> My work at preſent is to give you ſome obſervations upon the motions of <hi>Actual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> which is the work of God in the World, <hi>fulfilling his purpoſe;</hi> and fulfilling his Word, both of Promiſe, and of Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Two of thoſe Obſervations I have given you, diſcourſed upon them, and made ſome futable Applications. I proceed to a third.</p>
                  <p>3d Obſerv. <hi>Providence ordinarily doth its greateſt works, in the day of mans ſmalleſt things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is truly obſerved, that the greatneſs of Divine Power and Wiſdom is moſt ſeen in the Creation, and Preſervation of the leaſt creatures. As a Workman is moſt magnified, that can bring moſt art into the leaſt room: and it is as true, that the greatneſs of Divine Providence, delighteth to ſhew it ſelf in the day of mans ſmalleſt things. This Obſervation hath ſome cognation with the former: but there is more in it, as you will ſee by the Sequel of my Diſcourſe. Mans <hi>ſmalleſt things</hi> may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to ſignifie, 1. <hi>Smalleſt means.</hi> 2. <hi>Smalleſt hopes.</hi> 3. <hi>Smalleſt works or actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:192227:127"/>1. <hi>Smalleſt means:</hi> Though God be not tied to humane means, but ſometimes he worketh without them: Though <hi>they have no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy,</hi> but what they derive from him, and he commandeth them to exert and put forth; yet he often <hi>maketh uſe of means.</hi> But this you ſhall obſerve, and it ſhall be juſtified to you by and by, that God ſeldom doth great things by great means: but when God doth great work, though he make uſe of means, yet it is but little ſmall means: and the day of ſmalleſt means, is uſually the day of Gods work.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the day of <hi>ſmalleſt hopes:</hi> and indeed this almoſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally followeth upon the other; for humane hopes do uſually ebb, or flow according to the proportion of humane means that are in our Eye: ſo that if God doth his greateſt works in the day of <hi>ſmalleſt means,</hi> he doth them likewiſe in the day of our ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt <hi>hopes;</hi> which riſe higher, or fall lower (uſually) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the proſpect which we have of probable means.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, In the day of <hi>ſmalleſt works or actions:</hi> when man is moſt buſie, God ſeems to be moſt idle, moſt aſleep when we ſeem to be moſt awake. <hi>When God turns again the captivity of Sion, they are as thoſe that dream:</hi> they never ſee ſo much the Salvation of God, as when they <hi>ſtand ſtill.</hi> I do not ſay, when men will do leaſt; but when they do, when they can do leaſt, then uſually God doth his greateſt works of Providence.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall juſtifie this Obſervation by a great variety of inſtances:</p>
                  <p>Let the firſt be that great work of Providence, <hi>in bringing the children of Iſrael out of Egypt.</hi> It is true, they were no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable body, or number of people: they were at their coming out <hi>ſix hundred thouſand ſouls,</hi> but ſcattered over all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> a ſmall number in compariſon of the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> diminiſhed by all arts, by many years hard labour, in no Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry order, nothing of the power of the Lord was in their hand: they were ſo very ſlaves, that they murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> for but going in to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to ask for a deliverance for them: means of deliverance for them there appeared none to an humane Eye. Indeed, being ſo great a body of people, God might have made uſe of their Swords to have fought their way out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> he could eaſily have commanded them into a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary rank and file, but he uſeth none of them; only ſendeth <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> upon his Errand, to command <hi>Pharaoh to let his people go, that they might ſerve him.</hi> The ſame might be ſaid
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:192227:128"/>of their deliverance out of the captivity of <hi>Babylon:</hi> there was no means, they had no hopes from any appearance of humane probabilities, (thoſe that believed amongſt them doubtleſs had an hope from the Promiſe); there was none of them ſtirred that we read of. <hi>Cyrus</hi> proclaims their liberty. The walls of the <hi>ſtrong City of Jericho</hi> fall down before the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> upon the <hi>blowing of Rams-horns,</hi> and the peoples compaſſing it at a diſtance about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6. <hi>Canaan</hi> is given into the hands of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> they were indeed a conſiderable Army, but the <hi>ſeven Nations,</hi> through which they made their way into that poſſeſſion, were more ſtrong and mighty than they, as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. <hi>Gideon</hi> delivereth them, oppreſſed by the <hi>Midianites,</hi> with a party (rather than an Army) of three hundred men. <hi>Sampſon</hi> with the <hi>jaw-bone of an aſs</hi> ſtayeth a thouſand <hi>Philiſtines. David</hi> with a ſling and a ſtone, ſhall kill <hi>Goliah,</hi> when none durſt encounter him; and the hearts of the people were killed with his daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of them. Indeed, God hath ſeldom done any great things in the World by great means: when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> came out in an Army of thirty thouſand, of which we read in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13, and but of three thouſand <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that could be got together: and they alſo frighted, ſo as <hi>ver.</hi> 6, <hi>They hid themſelves in caves, thickets, rocks, and in high-places, and in pits:</hi> thoſe that kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (except <hi>Saul and Jonathan</hi>) <hi>had neither ſword, nor ſpear amongſt them,</hi> ver. 19, 20. <hi>Jonathan and his Armour-bearer</hi> go up alone and ſmite them: ſet all the Hoſt on trembling, and the multitude melteth away, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>The colour</hi> of the Water deceives the <hi>Moabites</hi> to their ruin, when <hi>Jehoram, Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat,</hi> and the <hi>King of Edom</hi> were almoſt all famined for want of water, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.20, 21. When <hi>Jehoſaphat knows not what to do,</hi> 2 Chron. 26.22, God tells them, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, <hi>They need not fight, only ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of God:</hi> they did but ſtand ſtill, and ſing, and praiſe; their Enemies deſtroy one another: Look upon Gods great work of Providence, in the converſion of the World to the <hi>obedience of the Goſpel;</hi> How doth God do this? Not <hi>by might,</hi> nor <hi>by power,</hi> but by <hi>his Spirit.</hi> Chriſt ſends out a few poor Fiſhermen: theſe ſhall go and perſwade the world to throw out their Idols, and to receive the new Doctrine of the Goſpel, which to their wiſdom appeared fooliſhneſs. The World was full of very learned Philoſophers: God could have converted, inſtructed, and ſent out them, but he chuſeth to do this great
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:192227:128"/>work by ſmall things: <hi>Chuſing</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28.) <hi>the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe: the weak things of the world, to confound thoſe that were mighty: the baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed, to bring to nought the things that are.</hi> Next to this was the great Work of God in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> begun in <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Luther;</hi> it was a day of very <hi>ſmall things,</hi> the whole world was <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and had given their power to the <hi>Roman beaſt:</hi> the remainders of the Church were in the <hi>valleys of Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Lucerne,</hi> and in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> a ſmall deſpiſed remnant. Now God begins to work, and by what means? <hi>Luther,</hi> a poor deſpiſed <hi>Fryer,</hi> he begins and preacheth againſt indulgences: the whole world al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt were againſt him, he hath to do with, the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> all the <hi>Popiſh Doctors;</hi> yet by theſe ſmall things the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God brings to paſs this his great work. It was a day of <hi>ſmall things with us,</hi> when we were delivered from the <hi>Spaniſh-Armado</hi> in the year 1588, from the intended <hi>Powder-Treaſon.</hi> In ſhort, I ſay we ſhall find, that the Providence of God hath done the greateſt works, that it hath brought to paſs in the world, in the day of mans ſmalleſt things; when there have been the ſmalleſt appearances of humane means, when the People of God have had the ſmalleſt hopes, and when they have been leaſt in action. God hath in his Providence ſeldom done any great things by great humane means.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon of this is the ſame, as of my former obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Becauſe thus he gets himſelf moſt glory.</hi> The Glory of God is the great end of all his actions, he worketh for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for the Honour and Glory of his own great Name. Now God hath more Honour and Glory by theſe accompliſhments, than if he ſhould bring them to paſs by greater and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means. The Apoſtle gives this very reaſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Why God choſe weak things to confound thoſe that are mighty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>His power is thus more magnified:</hi> He thus appears to be a great God, a mighty God, though it be true, that the Power of God is equally exerted, when he worketh by great means, as by ſmall: (had we ſpiritual eyes, or did we look upon means as we ought to do, as deriving all their efficacy from God), yet <hi>de facto,</hi> it is not ſo to us; and therefore you ſhall in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obſerve God often declaring, that he would work this, or
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:192227:129"/>that in this, or that manner, that his People might not ſay, that they had done this by their own might or power. The leſſer appearance there is of ſecond Cauſes, the more the efficiency of the firſt Cauſe is evident; ſo God getteth himſelf a great deal of Glory, by working in the day of mans ſmalleſt things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. (As I alſo told you under the former head) God getteth himſelf more Glory by <hi>the praiſes of his people:</hi> he is more admired in his workings, more praiſed and adored for his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The Enemies are alſo hereby enforced to confeſs the works of the Lord, and to acknowledg the greatneſs of his Power. But having enlarged upon theſe things under the former obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I ſhall add no more here, but come to the Application.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. The firſt Uſe I ſhall make of this point, ſhall be what the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> hath made before me, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmall things?</hi> The Prophet propoundeth it by way of Interrogation, but it contains a Precept in the bowels of it: Learn not to deſpiſe the <hi>day of ſmall things;</hi> it is uſually Gods day. It may be a day of <hi>ſmall things as to the Church,</hi> the ſtate of it may be very ſad, the caſe of it very low; little humane means or probabilities may appear of the amendment of its ſtate; all things may ſeem to make againſt the intereſt of God and Religion. Now I ſay, let no man <hi>deſpiſe this day of ſmall things:</hi> It may be a day of ſmall things with the particular ſoul, the caſe of it may be very ſad, it may be full of dejections, full of deſpondencies, hurried with temptations; it may have hope, and but a little hope, light ſhining in upon it at a poor crevice: let none now deſpiſe this day of <hi>ſmall things.</hi> Two things I would preſs upon you. 1. <hi>Not to deſpiſe this day.</hi> 2. <hi>To perform what is your poſitive duty with reference to ſuch a day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt, <hi>Deſpiſe not ſuch a day.</hi> Perſons or things may be deſpiſed two ways: 1. <hi>Directly.</hi> 2. <hi>Interpretatively.</hi> Take heed of deſpiſing it <hi>directly.</hi> Take heed of deſpiſing it <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively.</hi> We deſpiſe a perſon or thing <hi>directly,</hi> when in our hearts we contemn him or it, and have a low and poor eſtimate of him or it, and expreſs it by any outward ſign, as <hi>words, geſtures,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Enemies of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſcorned the <hi>Jews,</hi> employed in re-building the City and Temple; when they ſaid, <hi>What will theſe feeble Jews do? if a fox go up, he will break down
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:192227:129"/>what they have builded.</hi> It was (it ſeems) a <hi>day of ſmall things</hi> with the <hi>Jews,</hi> their Enemies deſpiſed them, and mocked at them. Thus <hi>Sennacherib</hi> deſpiſed <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he offered his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners two hundred horſes, <hi>if his maſter could ſet riders on them:</hi> Take heed of this deſpiſing. Thus the Popiſh party in <hi>Germany</hi> deſpiſed the day of <hi>ſmall things</hi> in the beginning of the Reformation by <hi>Luther;</hi> when they bid him <hi>go into his Cell, and pray, Lord have mercy upon me.</hi> The iſſue in all three caſes ſhewed, that they had no reaſon, as to any of them, to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the day of ſmall things: Providence uſually brings forth its greateſt works in ſuch a day. But beſides this deſpiſing,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>interpretative deſpiſing</hi> of ſuch a day. Take heed of this alſo: thus we may deſpiſe things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>When we do not give that due regard to them which we ought.</hi> Thus our Saviour telleth you, <hi>A man cannot ſerve two maſters, but he will cleave to the one, and deſpiſe the other;</hi> that is, not give that due regard which he ought to give to the other. He that neglecteth what ought not to be neglected, doth interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively deſpiſe; when we have not that due value for a thing we ought to have, we deſpiſe it. <hi>Thus Eſau deſpiſed his birth-right,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle): we no where read that he ſpake contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of it; but he did not duly value it, he ſold it for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible price, a meſs of pottage.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When becauſe of the <hi>ſmallneſs of means, our hearts fail in the uſe of the means we have;</hi> or, <hi>as to the promiſe:</hi> this is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of the day of ſmall things. Now I ſay, take heed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing ſuch a day any of theſe ways; it is uſually <hi>Gods day.</hi> Let your rule be this:</p>
                  <p>If a work, or iſſue of a work, be for Gods Glory; if it be the matter of a Divine Promiſe, though there may be but a ſmall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of means for the accompliſhment of it; take heed of deſpiſing it, either <hi>directly,</hi> or <hi>interpretatively. Who hath deſpiſed ſuch a day?</hi> (ſaith the Prophet), intimating, that none ought to deſpiſe it, none hath any juſt reaſon to deſpiſe it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, <hi>Do what is your duty</hi> in ſuch a day: you will ſay, What is that? I will open it in three things: 1. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe the means you have.</hi> 2. <hi>Exerciſe a faith in God, beyond the probable effect of thoſe means.</hi> 3. Make up in <hi>prayer,</hi> what you will want in action, through a want of means. Of each of theſe a word or two.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:192227:130"/>1. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe thoſe means and grounds of hope which you have.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> hath but a ſling and a ſtone to go out againſt <hi>Goliah</hi> with, yet he will uſe them. Means that have a natural vertue in them, or a divine inſtitution, have Gods ſtamp upon them, and muſt be uſed, leaving the event and ſucceſs unto God: we muſt neither idolize means, by attributing the divine Efficiency to them; nor yet tempt God by a neglect of them, when God affords us them. You ſhall obſerve God ſometimes commanding the uſe of means, which had no rational tendency to the production of the effect: as what influence could the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> blowing with <hi>Rams-horns,</hi> and the Army encompaſſing the City ſeven days, have upon the walls of <hi>Jericho;</hi> yet the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were bound to uſe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had the ſtamp of a divine Inſtitution upon them. It is much the ſame caſe, when they have a natural vertue, or a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional tendency; there is a divine ſtamp too, though of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nature: what means are proper muſt be uſed, how mean ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they appear in our eyes. What proportion was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer, and the whole Garriſon of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> between <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Army, and <hi>Abijahs?</hi> This but four hundred, the other eight hundred thouſand; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Army of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. God often works, yea, he ordinarily worketh by ſmall means, and Providence brings forth its great work in the day of mans <hi>ſmall things.</hi> If we be ſure that we are in Gods way, and about his work, let the means be what they will, if lawful, and rational, it is our duty to uſe them; God muſt be honoured in his own Inſtitutions, and ſought in his own way: though the means be ſmall, and our humane hopes ſmall; yet if we expect Gods bleſſing, this mercy muſt be ſought in the uſe of thoſe means which the Providence of God layeth before us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, <hi>The duty of a Chriſtian will lye much in the exerciſe of his Faith in God, beyond the probability of the means.</hi> This is the great duty of a Chriſtian, and the very end which God aimeth at in cutting us ſhort of means many times. I think we may ſay, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi media deficiunt ibi fides incipit;</hi> where means begin to fail, there faith begins to work: Where we are out of ſight, as to means, there's a room for faith; <hi>For it is</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen:</hi> By <hi>faith,</hi> here I mean, <hi>a truſting and relying upon God, as a God able and faithful.</hi> But
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:192227:130"/>to open this a little more clearly to you: I will ſhew you, 1. <hi>In what caſes we may warrantably exerciſe a faith in God beyond the vertue, and probability of means.</hi> 2. <hi>What means we may uſe for the help of our faith in this caſe.</hi> 3. <hi>What encouragements we may take to our ſelves in ſuch a caſe to ſet our faith on work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 Queſt. <hi>In what caſes may a Chriſtian exerciſe faith in God for the accompliſhment, beyond the vertue, efficacy and probability of humane means, to be uſed in order to it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. To this I anſwer, The object of faith muſt be <hi>a Promiſe.</hi> It is ridiculous to talk of an exerciſe of faith in God, for an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, for which we have no word to warrant us in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of it: But now, a Promiſe may be either <hi>particular,</hi> or <hi>General;</hi> of old many had: particular perſons, and the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> had particular promiſes made to them by God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, or mediately by his Prophets; we have no ſuch, God hath left us unto his written Word. There are many general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which ſhall be made good ſtill to particular Churches and perſons: Hence is our difficulty to conclude what it is we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a faith in God, for bringing to paſs. To direct you a little,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Where you have a particular promiſe,</hi> the caſe is plain. Some ſuch there are, as for the <hi>deſtruction of Antichriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the want of a ſpecial particular Promiſe, a <hi>general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is a ſufficient object for our faith.</hi> General promiſes made to the Church and people of God, are applicable to particular Churches, and particular Saints.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Every Precept doth imply a Promiſe:</hi> God hath certainly promiſed a bleſſing upon the doing of that which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to do; no man ſerveth God for nothing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Whatſoever iſſue certainly conduceth to the glory of God, is under a Promiſe:</hi> God hath reſolved to glorifie himſelf, and he ordereth all his actions in order to that end.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of all this amounts to thus much: We may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a faith in God, and truſt in him for accompliſhing by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence whatſoever in his Word, he hath either more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or generally promiſed: or whatſoever he hath commanded us to act in tendency unto, or whatſoever doth certainly tend to the glorifying of his great and holy Name. Now if any thing of this nature be upon the wheel, although we ſee the preſent vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:192227:131"/>means in order to the accompliſhment of it be ſmall, and in all appearance diſproportioned to the greatneſs of the event; yet a Chriſtian uſing what lawful means the Providence of God lays before him, may warrantably truſt in God for the exerting a further power for the accompliſhment of it, than is in the means which at preſent are apportioned to it. But this is now an hard thing to us. Let me therefore ſecondly, <hi>direct you what you ſhould do in a day of ſmall things,</hi> for the advantaging of your <hi>faith</hi> in this noble Exerciſe. I ſhall offer but two things in the Caſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Keep your Eye as much off the means, and as much upon God as you can.</hi> We have ſo much of <hi>ſenſe</hi> and reaſon in us, that we are very prone from one or other of them to take all our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures about future events. If we would keep our hearts ſteady in a time of ſuch exigencies as theſe, we muſt ſhut the Eyes both of our <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon.</hi> Faith credits a Propoſition, neither up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the demonſtrations of the one of theſe, nor the concluſions of the other; but the meer authority of God. Men count it wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom when they are upon precipices, never to look downward, but upward; if they look downward, their weak heads are apt to be giddy. Chriſtians in ſuch ſtreſſes of Providence as theſe are, have nothing elſe to do: if they look downward, their ſenſe, their reaſon, ſaith, <hi>how can theſe things be? If God would make windows in heaven</hi> (ſaith that Nobleman) <hi>theſe things could not be.</hi> Our poring upon means in the day of our ſmall things hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the exerciſe of our faith in God. <hi>If the foundations be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 11.3,) <hi>what can the righteous do?</hi> Means are the foundations of our natural hopes: now if theſe be deſtroyed, if there be little or nothing of theſe, what can we do? Wicked men are indeed at their wits-ends, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond and deſpair; but ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> v. 4, <hi>The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lords throne is in heaven, his eyes ſee, his eye-lids try the children of men</hi> God is ſtill where he was, and hath the ſame power, the ſame knowledg of things, the ſame rule and dominion. Twice in Scripture <hi>Abraham</hi> is propounded to us as a noble Example; and a father of the faithful in this thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. God had promiſed him a Son, a Son of his Wife <hi>Sarah;</hi> he grew to be an hundred years old, his Wife many years paſt child bearing; here was no means: yet <hi>Abraham</hi> believeth for a Child, and he was not <hi>weak in the faith</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle),
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:192227:131"/>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19, 20. How doth he behave himſelf? The Apoſtle telleth you, That <hi>he conſidered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, nor yet the deadneſs of Sarahs womb; he ſtaggered not at the Promiſe, but was ſtrong in faith giving glory to God; being fully perſwaded that what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, he was able to perform. Abraham,</hi> that he might keep up his heart, fixed on the promiſe; he conſidered not the nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or improbability of the means; he conſidered nothing but the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs of God.</hi> God had ſaid it, there was a promiſe for it, a promiſe from him who could not lye: then he conſidereth, that he who had promiſed was <hi>able alſo to perform:</hi> an honeſt faithful man may ſail in his promiſe, becauſe he may not be able to perform; but as God was faithful, ſo he was alſo able; he keeps his Eye off means, fixed upon God. So again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18, 19, <hi>By faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Iſaac, and he that had received the promiſe offered up his only begotten ſon; of whom it was ſaid, that in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God was able to raiſe him up even from the dead. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had a promiſe, that in <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſeed ſhould be called. God calls <hi>Abraham</hi> with his own hand to ſlay <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he could not but have ſuch thoughts as theſe: Lord, if <hi>Iſaac</hi> be gone, where is thy promiſe? what becomes of thy word? <hi>how ſhall my ſeed be called in him?</hi> how ſhall I be the father of the Jewiſh Nation, if <hi>Iſaac</hi> be he, in whom my ſeed muſt be called, and he be dead before he hath a child? He had nothing to relieve him under theſe thoughts but this, <hi>That God was able to raiſe him from the dead:</hi> hither he flies, and keeps up his faith in the Promiſe, by turning his eye off from the means, and meerly conſidering the power and faithfulneſs of God. You ſhall find <hi>Aſa</hi> doing thus, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.9, 10, 11: <hi>Aſa</hi> had but an Army of <hi>five hundred thouſand: Zerah</hi> the <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> cometh out againſt him with an Army of a <hi>million,</hi> and <hi>three hundred Chariots,</hi> there was double the number he had: If he had look'd upon the means, he muſt have deſponded; how ſhould five hundred thouſand deal with ten hundred thouſand? but he looks off the means, and fixeth his Eye upon God. <hi>Ver.</hi> 11, He <hi>cryeth unto the Lord,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O Lord our God, for we reſt on thee; and in thy Name we go againſt this multitude: O Lord, thou art our God, let not man prevail againſt thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:192227:132"/>
                  <p>Secondly, In ſuch a day conſider the <hi>experiences of Gods people:</hi> conſider <hi>what they did,</hi> and <hi>how they ſped.</hi> What they did, that you heard in the inſtance both of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Aſa.</hi> They ſhut the Eyes of their ſenſe and natural reaſon; they took off their Eyes from all conſideration of means, and eyed only <hi>the certainty of the Promiſe;</hi> the <hi>faithfulneſs of God,</hi> and <hi>the power of God.</hi> So did <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo did <hi>Aſa.</hi> Then 2. <hi>Conſider how they ſped: Abraham</hi> had a Son at the ſet-time; <hi>Abraham</hi> had his Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved, when the knife was at his throat, and his ſeed was called in <hi>Iſaac. The Lord ſmote the Ethiopians before Aſa, and before Juda,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith the Text, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.12, 13, 14. Now it is a great encouragement to us in the exerciſes of our faith, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the experiences of other of the Servants of God in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Faith. <hi>Our fathers truſted in thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 22); <hi>they truſted, and were delivered.</hi> The ſtrength of this lieth in the ſtedfaſtneſs and unchangeableneſs of God: he is the ſame, his name is <hi>I am. David</hi> as to <hi>Goliah,</hi> raiſed up his faith upon his former experiences in ſlaying the <hi>Lion and the Bear,</hi> 1 Sam. 17, and upon the experience of others, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22: nothing is more conducive, to help and relieve a Chriſtian, weak as to his faith, in the day either of ſmall things, as to the Church of God, in which he is conſidered as a member; or in the day of ſmall things as to his own perſonal concerns. God chuſeth the day of ſmall things to be ſeen in: it is the day which <hi>Providence</hi> chuſeth to ſhew it ſelf great in. And you may thus advantage your faith in God in ſuch a day. Now for your further encouragement in this exerciſe of faith in God, beyond the viſibility or apparent probability of means, I ſhall offer theſe things to your conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it <hi>is Gods ordinary time and method of working.</hi> This is that which I diſcourſed to you in juſtification of the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and proved it to you from a plenty of inſtances, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not enlarge here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>God never worketh with ſo much advantage to his own glory,</hi> as in ſuch a time when he fulfilleth his Word in the day of mans ſmall things. We never need doubt Gods purſuing of the great ends of his glory; He doth all things for himſelf, his glory is the end of all his great works. Now I ſay, God never worketh more for the advantage of his glory than in ſuch exigents: then is his power, and the greatneſs thereof moſt eminently made known: Then ſhall his people more ſee, and confeſs the Arm of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:192227:132"/>3. Conſider (thirdly) this is <hi>the proper work of faith.</hi> It is true, we ought to exerciſe Faith in the uſe of means, let them be never ſo great, never ſo probable for the accompliſhment of the the End: but the proper place for faith, is, where means are weak, or wanting, to put the Soul in hope againſt hope. It is <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen:</hi> as patience is an habit of grace given the Soul for a day of adverſity, ſo faith is made for an hour of ſenſible darkneſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Nothing ſo <hi>pleaſeth</hi> and <hi>engageth God, as ſuch an exerciſe of faith. Aſa,</hi> 2 Chron. 14.11, uſeth it as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with God: <hi>Help us, O Lord, for we reſt on thee, and in thy Name we go againſt this great multitude.</hi> The next Verſe ſaith, <hi>God ſmote the Ethiopians,</hi> 2 Chron. 13.18. You will find that <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Army was full double to the number of <hi>Abijah</hi>'s: and could not have been conquered without ſome extraordinary influence of God upon <hi>Abijah</hi>'s ſide. Now would you know what engaged the Lord of Hoſts. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, <hi>Thus the children of Iſrael were brought under at that time; and the men of Judah prevailed, becauſe they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers.</hi> See the contrary, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7; <hi>Hanani</hi> the Seer cometh to <hi>Aſa,</hi> and telleth him, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt relied on the King of Syria, and not relied on the Lord thy God, therefore the Hoſt of the King of Syria is eſcaped out of thy hands.</hi> Thus I have ſhewed you a ſecond thing, in which I conceive the duty of a Chriſtian lies in the day of <hi>ſmall things,</hi> viz. The exerciſe of a faith in God, beyond the vertue and probability of the means.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third piece of his duty is, <hi>To beware of the uſe of ſinful means in order to the accompliſhment of what he deſireth.</hi> It is a great vanity to which through our miſapprehenſion of means we are very ſubject: if we want lawful means, to make uſe of <hi>unlawful,</hi> thinking to add to the day of ſmall things this way. <hi>Abraham</hi> failed in this, going in to <hi>Hagar:</hi> ſo did <hi>Aſa,</hi> in the inſtance beforementioned, though he acted otherwiſe, when the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and <hi>Lubims</hi> were againſt him. Indeed, nothing is more contrary to faith than this; it ſpeaketh a plain diſtruſt in God: nothing is more improper and needleſs, ſuppoſing the truth of this Obſervation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The laſt thing to be done in ſuch a caſe, is <hi>Prayer to God, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by his arm what is wanting in humane means.</hi> To this <hi>Aſa,</hi> and <hi>Abijah,</hi> &amp; all the ſervants of God in ſuch diſtreſſes have had recourſe. God will be found in a way of Prayer.</p>

                  <p>Obſerv. 4. <hi>The Providence of God as to its works, relating to his Church and people, rarely as to circumſtances anſwereth the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, and confidences of the beſt of Gods people.</hi> I will open it in two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God never faileth <hi>the grounded expectations of his people, as to any thing which he hath promiſed.</hi> Pſa. 9.18, <hi>The expectation of the poor ſhall not periſh.</hi> Their expectation is upon God, and their Souls wait for God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62.5, and their expectation and confidence in him ſhall not fail; <hi>They that truſt in him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> It is made the portion of a wicked man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.18, that <hi>his expectation ſhall periſh;</hi> but the <hi>hope of the righteous ſhall be gladneſs.</hi> The Wiſeman ſaith, <hi>His expectation ſhall not be cut off,</hi> Prov. 23.18; The reaſon is plain, The <hi>expectation of good men</hi> is an expectation of <hi>faith,</hi> and the object of faith is the <hi>word of God;</hi> and <hi>heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, before one tittle of Gods word,</hi> be it of promiſe, or precept, ſhall fail: Many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:192227:133"/>as to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and as to Goſpel-Churches are fulfilled; ſome are yet to be fulfilled: Antichriſt is yet to be deſtroyed; The <hi>Jews</hi> (doubtleſs) are to be called in a more plentiful manner than they have yet been. There are many Scriptures that ſeem to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a more united, peaceable, glorious ſtate of the Church. Now theſe Promiſes, are matter of Gods peoples expectations; and as to the things promiſed, the expectations of the poor people of God ſhall not periſh for ever: the things ſhall certainly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. If their hopes, and expectations, and confidences might fail; the word of God, the truth of God might fail: but this cannot be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, as to <hi>circumſtances you ſhall obſerve, God rarely anſwereth the confidences and expectations of the beſt of men,</hi> unleſs they be part of the Promiſe. By <hi>circumſtances,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand whatſoever is not eſſential to the thing promiſed. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, 1. <hi>Time, when a thing is done.</hi> 2. <hi>Place, where a thing is to be done.</hi> 3. <hi>Particular perſons,</hi> by whom, as Inſtruments, God will do his work. 4. <hi>Particular means, or actions,</hi> by which the things ſhould be brought to paſs. Theſe and ſuch like I call <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,</hi> as to which Gods Providence often fails, not only the earneſt deſires and expectations, but the higheſt perſwaſions and confidences of men; yea even of ſuch as fear him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to <hi>perſons.</hi> Who, if he had not exactly conſidered the Promiſe, ſubjoined to what God had ſaid, they ſhould four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years be ſervants to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> (and it was not like <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> ſhould indeed live ſo long); but I ſay, if he had not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that, but only received a notion of the delivery of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> would not have thought <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhould have been the man who ſhould have given conduct to that motion? Who would have expected it from <hi>Moſes,</hi> a poor <hi>Hebrew</hi> child, expoſed to the next tide in a thin Ark of Bulruſhes? yet by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did the work. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had done that work, and given them forty years conduct in the Wilderneſs, and was grown an experienced Commander; who would not have thought, and expected that he ſhould have led them over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and given them poſſeſſion of the promiſed Land? But <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt die, and his ſervant <hi>Joſhua</hi> muſt do it. In the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the believing <hi>Jews</hi> doubtleſs had great expectation of a deliverance, according to the Promiſes ſo often repeated by the Prophet: and unqueſtionably they had their expectations upon this, and that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:192227:134"/>perſon, probable to have done it; but who could have dreamed that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould be the man? The Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under <hi>Saul,</hi> might reaſonably have expected that ſome or other of the great Soldiers, which were at that time doubtleſs in the Army of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſhould have encountred <hi>Goliah;</hi> Who could have thought of a Shepherd's coming and doing of it, with a ſling and a ſtone? There is a Promiſe under the New Teſtament for the bringing down of Antichriſt, the <hi>ruin of Babylon:</hi> how often have mens expectations been upon this, or that, or the other Prince to have done it? and to what ſtrange confidences have ſome, even good people grown? that this, or that perſon ſhould be the man, ſhould pull Antichriſt out of his Seat: we ſee hither to God hath failed all their expectations; the perſon appears not that ſhall do that great work; and when he ſhall appear, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it ſhall be one never talk'd of, never thought of.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As to Time:</hi> We have a ſtrange curioſity to know the <hi>times</hi> and ſeaſons, which is not for us to know, but are reſerved only to God. <hi>Tell us</hi> (ſay the Diſciples) <hi>when ſhall theſe things be, and what ſhall be the ſign of thy coming, and of the end of the World,</hi> Matth. 24.3? Acts 1.6, <hi>Wilt thou at this time reſtore the Kingdom to Iſrael?</hi> There are three great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or four, concerning the Churches of God, the fulfilling of which we yet expect, 1. That for the <hi>deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2.7, 8. 2. For the <hi>full converſion of the Jews,</hi> Rom. 11.26, (to ſpeak nothing of many other Texts which look that way). 3. <hi>Chriſts ſecond coming,</hi> of which you know the Scripture ſpeaketh plentifully. 4. A <hi>more calm, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and peaceable ſtate of the Church;</hi> which many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alſo ſeem to look toward: whether for a thouſand years preciſely, under the conduct of Chriſts coming perſonally, or no, hath, you know, been much diſputed: but the generality of the moſt inquiſitive Divines into the will of God, do think there ſhall be a more peaceable and calm ſtate of the Church of God. Now it is ſtrange to obſerve the curioſity of many in ſearching out the preciſe time when theſe things, or ſome of them, ſhould begin, or be. Some have fixed this year; ſome another. How many agreed in the year 1666, is known to thoſe any thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with books: we ſee the Providence of God hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to failed all mens conjectures; and ſtill it holds, that of theſe days and hours knoweth no man; the beſt Prophets have proved but vain gueſſers.</p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:192227:134"/>
                  <p>I might give you a-like inſtances as to Places and Means: but you will generally obſerve it, That the Providence of God rarely, as to circumſtances, ſuteth any of our fancies. And the ſame thing we ſhall obſerve as to particular caſes of Chriſtians, who are ready to think, that if ever, by ſuch an inſtrument at ſuch a time, or by ſuch a means, they muſt, or ſhall obtain their deſired mercy. They obtain it probably, but by quite other means, and at other times, and by other inſtruments than they fancied, and ſuch perhaps as they never thought of; the thing is plain, and evidenced from a daily experience: let us a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Reaſon of it. Hath God a pleaſure in fruſtrating the expectations of his people? or expoſing them to the worlds cenſures, as perſons pretending to more acquaintance than they indeed have with the Counſels of God? Surely no: But God by this method of his Provdience does two things: 1. <hi>He puniſheth the raſhneſs and vanity of his peoples ſpirits.</hi> 2. <hi>He more conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the glory of his own name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He by this means chaſtiſeth the vanity and raſhneſs of his people:</hi> there is a great deal of vanity in peoples ſpirits in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Let me ſhew you the great evil of this in ſome few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There is in it an unwarrantable curioſity. Job</hi> tells us, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.12, That <hi>vain man would be wiſe, though he be like a wild aſſes colt.</hi> We have a great itch after knowledg of things, which God hath hidden from us. Now this is a great Errour, and you ſhall obſerve it continually checked by our Saviour, when any thing of it diſcovered it ſelf even in his beſt Diſciples: when they ſaid to him, <hi>Wilt thou at this time reſtore the Kingdom to Iſrael?</hi> He ſaith unto them, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons,</hi> Acts 1.6, 7. When <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to him, <hi>John</hi> 21.21, 22, <hi>Lord, what ſhall this man do?</hi> Mark our Saviours anſwer; <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.</hi> When the Diſciples asked him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.3, <hi>Tell us, when ſhall theſe things be, and what ſhall be the ſign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? Jeſus anſwereth and ſaith unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.</hi> God of old had an Ark into which none might look. There are ſecrets of his Will, which are as yet the Ark of God: we would fain be looking into this Ark, there's our vanity. God chaſtens us in it with diſappointments, that we may learn, not to pry into Gods ſecrets; things which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:192227:135"/>ſee, becauſe God hath hidden them; the things are ſure, the viſion is certain, and there is an appointed time, but that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time is not publiſhed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is as to theſe things <hi>an ungrounded confidence, which God alſo chaſtiſeth by theſe diſappointments:</hi> There is nothing more worthy of a Chriſtian, than a believing God upon his word, and a relying upon him for the fulfilling of it. There is nothing more idle, nothing more unworthy of him, than to be confident, where he hath no word to ſet his foot upon. Now ſuch a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as this, is the confidence of people as to circumſtances. It is true, as to the <hi>Jews</hi> deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the promiſe did not only extend to the thing, but to the time: the four hundred years for the firſt were named, and the 70 years for the latter; yea, and the particular perſon <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by whom God would deliver them. But it is not ſo as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which we live in expectation of the fulfilling of, as to the Church: God hath no-where revealed the year for the ruin of Antichriſt, nor for the calling of the Jews; nor when the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion-days of the Church ſhall begin, or when Chriſt ſhall come to the laſt judgment. If people will expect any of theſe things ſhall begin, or be at ſuch a time, in ſuch a year, by ſuch perſons, their Confidences are without ground or bottom, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended faith but a rude and bold preſumption, a ruſh growing up without any mire, and a flag growing up without water; and it is but reaſonable, that God ſhould chaſtiſe theſe vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is in theſe things <hi>a ſinful limitation of God.</hi> It is laid to the charge of the <hi>Iſraelites, That they limited the Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 78.41. When men tye up God to their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the fulfilling of his promiſes, or his threatnings, they limit God. Now this is a great ſin, God is a free and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Agent, he works by means, or without means; ſometimes by means that ſeem probable, ſometimes by ſuch as have no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of probability to produce the effect: he can work how, and when, and by whom he pleaſeth: he that fixeth God to his circumſtances, ſecretly ſaith, It muſt be thus, or no way; by this means, and by no other, now or never. What ground elſe is there for the expectation or confidence, if God hath no where revealed his Will as to particular circumſtances, only as to the accompliſhment of the thing in general? God will have us know we are not to limit him.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:192227:135"/>4. Such expectations and confidences are uſually but <hi>introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to a greater unbelief.</hi> God hath promiſed the things in the plain letter of Scripture: the Viſion is ſure; vain man would be wiſe, and ſearch out when theſe things ſhall be, and where accompliſhed, and by what inſtruments and means; at length he fixeth his eye upon ſome inſtruments at work in the world, or ſome means which he fancieth probable to bring theſe words into a Being. Upon theſe he raiſeth up to himſelf high expectations, and groweth very confident, that in ſuch a year the thing will be; and ſuch a perſon ſhall be Gods Inſtrument, and by ſuch means he will effect it: It proveth no ſuch thing. What a temptation this often proves to men, to believe nothing of the thing; but becauſe they have deceived themſelves in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations and confidences, for which they have no ground, to think alſo that God hath deceived them, and there ſhall no ſuch thing at all be as he hath promiſed?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And laſtly, <hi>Theſe expectations and confidences prove often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very great temptations to the uſe of unlawful means, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the bringing about of what we would have, and know God will bring to paſs;</hi> and do but fancy that he will do it at ſuch, or ſuch a time, or by ſuch and ſuch inſtruments. The ſtory of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> is a dreadful ſtory to this purpoſe; There is a world of evil in theſe vain confidences and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſequent to them, which God ſometimes puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a more ſmart and ſevere manner, as he did to thoſe Ruſticks, that ſo much diſturbed the <hi>Civil peace</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> but generally puniſheth by diſappointments, to bring us to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular truſt and confidence in him, where we have a plain and ſure word to fix our foot upon.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have ſhewed you the reaſonableneſs of theſe croſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Divine Providence, in point of Divine Juſtice; that God might puniſh peoples ſinnings in them, and caution others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the like guilt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let me (in the ſecond place) ſhew you the reaſonableneſs of it in order to the <hi>glory of God;</hi> which I have often told you is the great end which God aims at in all his great Works, whether of Creation, or of Providence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The work is more eminently ſeen to be the Lords,</hi> although he in effecting it, maketh uſe of inſtruments and humane means. God doth not always, yea, he doth not ordinarily work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:192227:136"/>but maketh uſe of rational means, and worketh in, with, and by them. Now if God in theſe workings ſhould make uſe of means, and inſtruments, and circumſtances, which our fancies preſcribe unto him; we ſhould be apt to overlook the mighty Power and Efficiency of God in the means; for the more we have a proſpect of an event in the ſecond Cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes, the leſs we ſee of the firſt Cauſe in it. But when we ſee our ſelves diſappointed in all our expectations, as to time, perſons, means, circumſtances, and the thing brought about by perſons we thought not of, at a time we looked not for it, by means not at all in our eyes as probable to effect it; the more is the hand and power of God ſeen in the effect, while we cry out, <hi>This is the Lords doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, God hath more Glory from the <hi>Prayers, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations, and Praiſes of his people.</hi> By theſe things God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, as his Will is done, as his Power is recognized. Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments produce more extraordinary <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> when we meet with them, we ſee the folly of our raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ungrounded confidences; and ſee reaſon to lye low before the Lord, with more fervent Prayers to God, to take his work into his own hand, and having manifeſted to us our follies, now to declare his own wiſdom, that having broken our arms of fleſh, he would now make bare his own holy arm; and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his word at laſt by means and circumſtances not known to us, produce praiſes, adorings, and admirings of his infinite wiſdom, and further confidences in God for the time to come; when we ſee arms of fleſh broken, and find our bruiſed reeds and broken ſtaffs but running into our hands, and wounding us, inſtead of helping us. I have done with the Doctrinal part of this Obſervation, I come now to the Application of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. The firſt Uſe may be, <hi>Not to wonder at diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this nature, and to take heed they be no temptations to us.</hi> Here are you ſee two branches: 1. <hi>Not to wonder at them.</hi> There is nothing more ordinary; it is not often that a Church, or body of people, or a particular ſoul, or perſon, obtaineth any great mercy or deliverance in the way they looked for it, or at that moment of time they expected it in. God delights to ſurprize his peoples hearts with joy and gladneſs: we are ſick, and we are ready to think ſuch a perſon, and by ſuch a means,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:192227:136"/>muſt heal us: the cure comes quite another way. <hi>Naaman</hi> thought the Prophet would have come, and laid his hand upon his leprous body: the Prophet bids him go and waſh in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Jordan.</hi> We are in terrors, in troubles of mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we are ready to think, ſuch, or ſuch a Miniſter muſt ſpeak to us, and then we ſhall be relieved; he cometh, and applieth what help he can; we are yet diſquieted, and find no relief at all; the mercy comes at laſt quite another way: Mercy comes to Gods People, as Judgment (ordinarily) comes upon ſinners, in a way, and upon a day they looked not for it: when with <hi>Agag</hi> they ſay, <hi>Surely the bitterneſs of death is paſt:</hi> I ſay, ſo mercies ordinarily come to Gods People, in an unlooked-for time, in a way, and by perſons they looked not for it by.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Let not ſuch diſappointments be temptations to you:</hi> Let them not be temptations to make you <hi>diſtruſt the promiſes, or to uſe any unlawful and indirect means to obtain your deſires.</hi> It is not God that hath deceived you: you have but deceived your ſelves: God hath made you certain promiſes of the things; you will limit him to do it by ſuch a time, by ſuch means, by ſuch perſons and inſtruments: The promiſes expreſs no ſuch things, but have left God to his liberty. You have no reaſon to diſtruſt Gods word, becauſe you have diſappointed your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Let us make this uſe of the Obſervation, <hi>To embrace the promiſes, and to depend upon God for the fulfilling of them, without limiting him as to circumſtances.</hi> Let us do this as to thoſe great promiſes which are behind to be fulfilled: as to the <hi>deſtruction of Antichriſt, the calling of the Jews, the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, the more happy and calm ſtate of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. The Scripture ſeems clear as to the things, that they ſhall be; but it is far from being clear, that it ſhall be in ſuch a year, or by ſuch a mean or inſtrument; there is nothing particular of this nature for a good Chriſtian to ſet the foot of his faith upon. I have ſhewed you, there is a great vanity of Chriſtians in theſe things. I know Chriſtians have a very great curioſity to ſearch dark Prophecies, to find out the particular circumſtances for theſe things: I cannot commend their diligence; it is much like the hard labour and ſtudy of thoſe that have been ſtudying the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone;</hi> a great deal of money, and much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time hath been ſpent about it, nothing yet effected; no
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:192227:137"/>more hath there been in theſe things: men have wearied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in vain, and their ſtudy hath been but <hi>labour and travel.</hi> 2. Again, <hi>As to promiſes that concern our particular ſouls,</hi> for comfort, for a victory over temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are many, they are exceeding ſweet; but they are <hi>general,</hi> not to this or that individual perſon, but to ſuch as love and fear the Lord, to perſons under ſuch or ſuch qualifications; they are exceeding ſweet, but they are not made with circumſtances. God will have his people truſt him, he will have them wait for him. Take heed either of ſaying, <hi>Theſe things ſhall never be:</hi> this is to give the lye to the God of Truth. <hi>God ſays thou ſhalt live:</hi> thou ſayeſt, <hi>I ſhall dye, I ſhall fall by the hand of this temptation:</hi> and take heed of ſaying, <hi>If it ever be, it muſt be by ſuch a time, by ſuch a Miniſter, it would have been by ſuch a Miniſter,</hi> &amp;c. This is to limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> thou knoweſt not the ways of God, it is a knowledg too high, too deep for thee: Providence uſually bringeth home, both the promiſes to the Saints, and the threatnings to the Sinners, in a way quite different from what they looked for, or it may be expected it in.</p>
                  <p>I have ſpoken enough already to take Chriſtians off this; but yet becauſe it is a great point, a thing wherein we are prone to ſlip, and wherein our ſlipping is more than ordinarily dangerous: let me ſpend a little time further to argue you out of this vanity, and to direct your Souls in the expectation of the fulfilling of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider <hi>how much the ſtrength of your ſouls is ſpent, and how vainly, in the expectations of your own fancies.</hi> As the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of that for ſubſtance, which God never promiſed, is but the expectation of our own fancy: ſo neither is the expectation of what God hath promiſed under ſuch circumſtances as are no part of the promſe. Now the ſtrength of our Souls runneth much out in ſuch expectations: Let a man but fancy, that in ſuch a year <hi>Babylon ſhall fall,</hi> The <hi>Jews ſhall be called; The thouſand years ſhall begin,</hi> That by ſuch a time the Church in diſtreſs, or his Soul in diſtreſs, ſhall be delivered: It is ſtrange to obſerve, how the Soul will ſpend it ſelf upon ſuch a Notion; the thoughts of men run upon it, their wits are bent to interpret dark Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into their own fancies: it preſently becomes the main ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of their faith, and the great argument of their hope, and the whole ſubject of their diſcourſes; and at laſt (poſſibly) they
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:192227:137"/>are enforced to acknowledg, that they had a lye in their right hand. The Prophet uſeth the expreſſions upon an higher argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but yet they are applicable here: <hi>Why ſpend you your ſtrength for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which will not profit?</hi> There is nothing that is <hi>bread</hi> for a Soul, but the Word of God; it hath pitied my Soul many times to obſerve ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (otherwiſe I hope ſerious perſons), how they have ſpent themſelves in ſuch Enquiries and expectations as theſe.</p>
                  <p>Conſider (ſecondly) <hi>how the faith of your ſouls is often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered and ſhaken by your diſappointments in theſe things.</hi> I do but name this again; for I before enlarged upon it. How ready are we to diſ-believe the Promiſe wholly, becauſe it comes not in the circumſtances that we fancied it would come! The Apoſtle was aware of this great Evil; and therefore when ſome had been prophecying in the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> of a ſudden com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt to Judgment, he writeth to that Church, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, <hi>Now we beſeech you brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him, that you be not ſoon ſhaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by ſpirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us; as if the day of Chriſt were at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaw that this haſty and ungrounded expectation of Chriſts coming, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch circumſtances as he had now here revealed, did not only tend to the troubling of Chriſtians when they ſaw themſelves diſappointed, but alſo to the ſhaking of their faith, as to the thing it ſelf: and therefore beſeecheth them, <hi>by the coming of our Lord Jeſus, and by their gathering together unto him:</hi> what can be the meaning of that, but this? If ever you expect <hi>the joyful coming of Chriſt,</hi> and would keep your faith ſteady as to it; if ever you would be with us gathered unto him, concern not your ſelves in thoſe who would limit the Promiſes to the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their own fancying: Let them pretend <hi>Revelations of the Spirit,</hi> or <hi>wreſt the word of God;</hi> yet faith the Apoſtle, <hi>let them not deceive you.</hi> You have an eminent inſtance of this ſhaking of Chriſtians faith, ſo conſequential to this limiting of God to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31. There was a Promiſe <hi>of redeeming Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> Chriſt had been crucified, and three days were paſſed, and they had heard nothing tending to their expectation: ſay they, <hi>We truſted it had been he which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael: and beſides all this, to day is the third day ſince theſe things were done.</hi>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:192227:138"/>Their faith began to ſhake as to the main Promiſe, becauſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the accompliſhment of them, did not fit it with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which they had fancied.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider, it much hindereth that duty of <hi>waiting upon God, which the Scripture ſo often preſſeth upon us.</hi> I need not mention <hi>particular Scriptures:</hi> there is hardly any one duty more preſſed upon Chriſtians in Scripture, than this patient waiting upon, and for God. Now how doth that Soul wait upon God, that limits God to his circumſtances of time, place, means, perſons? he indeed waiteth upon thoſe circumſtances a while; but when he is diſappointed as to them, he knoweth not how to wait upon God any longer. The Soul which truly waiteth on God, leaveth circumſtances unto him. You will ſay unto me in the next place, <hi>What then is the duty of a Chriſtian with reſpect to the Promiſes, whether concerning the Church, or his own ſoul in particular?</hi> I anſwer, to <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>embrace them,</hi> and be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded</hi> of the <hi>truth of them,</hi> and leave unto God the way, time, manner, and circumſtances for fulfilling of them, which he hath not revealed: going on in the way of our plain duty, till God ſhall pleaſe to give a being to his Word. You ſhall ſee your duty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13, <hi>Theſe all died in the faith, not having received the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; but having ſeen them afar off, and were perſwaded of them, and embraced them, and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims on the earth.</hi> What promiſes were theſe? The promiſes of <hi>Canaan,</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias. Abraham</hi> ſaw Chriſts day, <hi>and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced</hi> (ſaith our Saviour); They <hi>received theſe promiſes in their ears,</hi> God revealed his will for theſe things; they <hi>ſaw them afar off,</hi> as things like to come to paſs many years after; <hi>they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of them,</hi> of the truth of them, that God would <hi>give them a being:</hi> they embraced them with thankful believing hearts, and lived ſo, as that they confeſſed themſelves ſtrangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims of the Earth; in a conſtant courſe of ſelf-denial, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the will of God, and in a crucifixion to the World: they never ſtood troubling themſelves to ſearch out the particular time, and circumſtances, when, and which way God would do theſe things: but kept in the faith of the Promiſe; leaving cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances unto God: Let us go and do likewiſe. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this diſcourſe with a Text of our Saviours, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.20, 21, <hi>And when he was demanded of the Phariſees, when the Kingdom of God ſhould come?</hi> He anſwered and ſaid, <hi>the Kingdom of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:192227:138"/>not with obſervation: Neither ſhall they ſay, Lo here, or Lo there, for behold the Kingdom of God is within you.</hi> Let me a little open theſe words to you: <hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi> that is, <hi>the great things which concern the Kingdom of God; theſe are not</hi> brought to paſs, and come not with <hi>Obſervation,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that's the Original phraſe, we tranſlate with <hi>Obſervation.</hi> There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers interpretations given of that Text: Not with a <hi>ſuperſtitious obſervation of days, months, and years;</hi> ſo ſome make the ſenſe, according to that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galatians, You obſerve days, and months, and years: I am afraid of you,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 17, <hi>The kingdom of God is not in meat, and drink, but righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and peace.</hi> Some underſtand it of <hi>external Obſervations</hi> of meat and drink, ſuch as God had commanded to the <hi>Jews:</hi> but the moſt, and moſt valuable Interpreters agree in one of theſe two ſenſes: which indeed well conſidered, both make but one.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>So as it may or can be obſerved.</hi> Thus <hi>Brugenſis, Piſcator,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> who indeed tranſlates it, <hi>Ita ut obſervari poſſit;</hi> ſo as it can be obſerved. <hi>Theophylact</hi> underſtands it of <hi>the time;</hi> ſo as the time cannot be fixed, nor the place neither. It followeth, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they ſay, Lo here is Chriſt, or lo there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Not with a worldly Pomp, Splendor</hi> or <hi>Ceremony.</hi> Thus <hi>Stella, Chemnitius, Eraſmus, Piſcator,</hi> &amp;c. This is the ſame indeed with the other: and therefore they generally add, <hi>ut obſervari poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,</hi> we do not uſe to obſerve the coming of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but by obſerving ſome <hi>Pomp, Splendor,</hi> &amp;c. preliminary to it. Now (ſaith Chriſt) the Kingdom of God cometh not ſo as it can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, it ſtealeth upon men and ſurprizeth them: <hi>it cometh not by obſervation.</hi> Chriſt indeed hath given us general ſigns of his ſecond coming, and of the end of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he hath alſo added, <hi>Of that day and hour knoweth no man.</hi> I ſuppoſe the ſame thing is to be ſaid as to the Promiſes for <hi>calling the Jews:</hi> for the expected <hi>peace, and tranquillity of the Church of God,</hi> when the <hi>uſual years ſhall begin,</hi> &amp;c. Believe the thing, pray, wait, that is all which we have to do in the caſe.</p>

                  <p>I Am yet proceeding in recommending to you ſome further Obſervations I have made upon the motions of Actual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in the execution of the eternal Counſels and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of God; and fulfilling his Word, whether of Promiſe or Threatning. Four I have done with: A Fifth I ſhall now offer and diſcourſe a little upon it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5th Obſerv. <hi>The Actual Providence of God, in the production of its great works, relating to his Church, or the particular members of it, doth ordinarily ſuit or fit the circumſtances of the world, or the circumſtrances of particular perſons, to the work he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to produce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay <hi>Ordinarily.</hi> Every Rule muſt have ſome Exception: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſuch Rules, as upon obſervation we fix concerning the methods of Divine Providence. The infinitely wiſe God tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not always in the ſame ſteps; I ſay, in his great works rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting either to <hi>the Church, or to ſuch particular perſons as are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it:</hi> Theſe two, I before told you were the great Objects of <hi>Special Providence.</hi> As <hi>Canaan</hi> of old was <hi>the Land which God cared for, upon which</hi> his Eye was, <hi>from the beginning of the year to the end of it:</hi> ſo his Church ſtill is, and to the end of the World will be the object of his more ſpecial care; and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to which, Providence produceth its moſt remarkable works: Hence you ſhall obſerve throughout all the Scripture,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:192227:139"/>though mention be made of ſuch other Sons as the Patriarchs had, and other Nations and Princes contemporary with thoſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> are named; yet very little of their ſtory is recorded, and that only ſubſervient to the ſtory that was to keep a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of Gods dealings with his own people. This makes me reſtrain the Obſervation to the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> of it; and that which I recommend to your remark is, Gods ordinary fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the circumſtances of the adjacent world (which lyes round about the Church, as the mountains about <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> or the Nations of old about <hi>Canaan</hi>) to what he is producing in his Church; and the particular circumſtances of perſons, to the work God hath to produce, more eminent with relation unto them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I will ſhew you this, with reference to the productions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, relating to the collective body of his people, which we call the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>With reference to particular perſons, that have relation to this body, in matters of an outward concern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>With reference unto the ſouls of his people, in matters of a more inward and ſpiritual concern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>With reference to the great products of Providence relating to the body of his people, called the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Jews</hi> (you know, under the Old Teſtament) were the only people that could lay claim to this great Name, To whom God was nigh, in the midſt of whom he dwelt, whom he ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten delivered, and for whom he ſo ſignally engaged. Great works of Providence we read of relating to them: their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and conduct through the wilderneſs; their bringing out of <hi>Babylon</hi> after their ſeventy years Captivity, and re-building their Temple and City. The ſending of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> When the Providence of God ſets about theſe works, let us obſerve how God fitted circumſtances to theſe great products, <hi>making every thing beautiful in his time</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.11.) In the bringing of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> God did two things: 1. <hi>He brought out the Jews out of a Nation</hi> where they had been bred, and lived ſome hundreds of years: His Providence now fitteth circumſtances to this; it ſuffereth the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> moſt miſerably to oppreſs them, ſo as they were weary of their lives. It is hardly elſe conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they would willingly have quitted their poſſeſſions, and their Native-Countrey, to obtain a land promiſed 400 years
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:192227:140"/>before; and that not without overcoming the difficulties of an houling wilderneſs, and many years fighting. The Providence of God alſo deſtroyeth <hi>Egypt</hi> by Ten ſucceſſive plagues, elſe the King and his Servants would never have let ſo many 100000 perſons go out of their Dominions. Circumſtances were fitted by God to the deſign of his Providence: they muſt be griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly oppreſſed, that they may be made willing to go; and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> People and Nation muſt be deſtroyed, that he may ſuffer them to get into a body for a march, and furniſh them with a <hi>viaticum</hi> for their journey. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Army muſt be deſtroyed; alas, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are in no circumſtances fit to fight them: the Sea ſhall divide it ſelf, they ſhall ſee the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> go through ſafely as on dry ground: this ſhall allure them to follow them, then the waters ſhall return and ſwallow them up.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God <hi>brings this people out of Babylon:</hi> he had promiſed, that after 70 years they ſhould come out; <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he conquers <hi>Babylon</hi> juſt at that time, and it was his intereſt to let them go, as much as it was the intereſt of the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> to keep them there: He thus endeared the <hi>Jews</hi> to him, and thus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted a Colony; yea, and ſecured <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to his obedience, which was before under the Command of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who were his Enemies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſending of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was <hi>a great product of Divine Providence:</hi> he was to introduce a new way of worſhip, to preach (what to them in their corrupted ſtate) was a new Doctrine: had the <hi>Jews</hi> been in their heighth, this would by no means have been endured by them: See how God fitteth the worlds circumſtances, to this great product of Providence: <hi>The ſcepter is departed from Judah, and the lawgiver from his feet:</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> are become Tributaries to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and under their power; ſo they were not ſo brisk as they would have been: There is a general peace over all the world, ſo as the <hi>Romans</hi> were not ſo jealous of making parties and factions: people were more at leiſure to liſten to the Goſpel, and Prince of peace. Now comes the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If we ſhould carry the buſineſs a little further, What great work hath God ever done ſince, in which we may not ſee a remarkable fitting of the worlds cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to the production of it? I will inſtance but in one or two things, referring to the Proteſtant-Reformation.</p>
                  <p>Our reformation you know was began in the time of <hi>Henry</hi>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:192227:140"/>the Eight; How did God fit our circumſtances to it? King <hi>Henry</hi> ſhall fall out with the <hi>Pope,</hi> becauſe he will not allow his divorce, and ſo ſhall break with him, and ſet up a purer courſe of Religion; it was hardly to have been imagined, how <hi>England</hi> ſhould have been freed from Popery at another time, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the chief Magiſtrates aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>There was a ſtrange concurrence of Divine Providences in the reformation which was begun in <hi>Germany. Luther</hi> was raiſed up, a man of a moſt invincible ſpirit and courage: Printing was found out a-few years before in that very Countrey, in 1440; by which means, <hi>Luther's,</hi> and others books were preſently dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> [<hi>V. Sculteti annales,</hi> l. 1. c. 1.] The knowledg of Arts and Learning, were juſt reſtored to the world, after the long darkneſs and ignorance in which Popery had muffled the world. Many ſecret favourers of Religion were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to great places in the Popiſh-Church, who either out of favour to the reformed Religion, or out of love to their learning, ſhewed great kindneſs to the firſt Reformers: ſeveral great Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> were alſo prepared; ſome poſſibly out of conſcience, others out of principles of honour, favouring and protecting <hi>Luther.</hi> In ſhort, the Providence of God hath hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at any time produced any great work, in the change of the State of the Church, or of any Kingdom; but his fitting of the circumſtances of the world to it, have been ſtrangely obvious and remarkable to every obſerving eye.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us, ſecondly, take a view of the Providence of God working as to particular perſons, with reference to things of a more outward concern: take it in the inſtances of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Haman,</hi> of the three Children, and <hi>Daniel. David</hi> was to be brought to be King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> from a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds boy, to be a great Prince; he ſhall firſt kill <hi>Goliah;</hi> he ſhall be ſent for to Court, to drive away <hi>Sauls</hi> evil ſpirit with his Harp; he ſhall marry, the Kings Daughter, and grow great with <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than. Joſeph</hi> is to become a great man in <hi>Egypt;</hi> he ſhall firſt be recommended to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> grow great with him, a famine ſhall come, he ſhall ſave much people alive; and thus be in great honour, and in a capacity to ſerve his Fathers family. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God deſigns to preſerve the <hi>Jews,</hi> to advance <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai,</hi> to ruin <hi>Haman.</hi> An <hi>Hebrew</hi> Lady, by a ſtrange Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhall come to be Queen, and one that ſhall be <hi>Mordecai's</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:192227:141"/>Neece. <hi>Haman</hi> ſhall be found upon the bed with <hi>Eſther,</hi> and miſtaken in his Complement to her, as if he had a deſign to force her, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Infinite are the inſtances which might be brought.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us conſider the motions of Providence with reference to the ſouls of people, as to their beſt and moſt ſpiritual concerns.</hi> If God hath much people in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall be called thither: he ordereth Miniſters to places, or particular perſons to a Miniſtry proper for the work, in a ſtrange way many a time, when he hath a deſign to do good to particular ſouls. But here let me recommend one obſervation to you; When he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth the tryal of a Child of his, with inward troubles and temptations, he uſually fits it with an unhealthy body, ſuted to ſuch impreſſions; and when he deſigneth the reſtoring of quiet and peace to the ſpirit, he ordinarily fits it with an healthy body: Not that all the trouble and diſquietudes of the ſpirit floweth from the indiſpoſition of the body; the contrary is evident enough to any who diligently obſerve Chriſtians at ſuch times, and may know many others under the ſame kinds, and poſſibly greater degrees of bodily diſtempers, whoſe minds are not ſo diſturbed, who have no ſuch temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it is, but ſuch inward troubles are circumſtanced with bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſturbances; and ſo on the contrary, it is rare to find a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, quiet, rejoycing ſpirit; but it is ſuited alſo with a freedom from bodily diſtempers, eſpecially ſuch as have an influence upon the head, and affect that. But I ſhall enlarge no further upon what is ſo evident to any who obſerveth any thing of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Now the Reaſon of this is evident; <hi>Becauſe, though the Providence of God ſometimes produceth things miraculouſly; yet it ordinarily produceth them by the way of means: ſome means, although poſſibly not adequate, and fully proportioned to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> The Providence of God is a ſervant to his Glory: that is the end for which it works, for which it always worketh, and can work for no other end: but it doth not always work for the glorifying of God in the ſame Attribute: ſometimes it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth his Power, ſometimes his Wiſdom, ſometimes his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It glorified Gods Power in the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> he was ruined by the immediate ſupernatural
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:192227:141"/>hand of God; but ordinarily the Providence of God worketh by means, and the Wiſdom of God is moſt eminently ſeen, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, and ordering, and diſpoſing means unthought-of; and yet ordinarily the Power of God is alſo glorified, the means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as are very unlikely, or improbable to produce ſuch an effect. Now this being granted, that the moſt ordinary way of Gods working is by means, little or much; there muſt be an ordering and preparation of them: and this is the reaſon of Gods fitting adjacent circumſtances to his work which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth; thoſe circumſtances, being the ordinary means, which God thinks fit to make uſe of, to work in, with, and by. And here the great Power and Wiſdom of God is ſeen, in ordering the affairs of the world, ſo as they ſhall ſute his great deſigns and purpoſes, that men ſee reaſon to cry out, <hi>O the depth of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and of the Counſel of God!</hi> So that, look as God did not bring man into the World, till he had fitted the World for his uſe and Government; nor doth bring any creature (by his continued Creation) into the World, before its table is prepared: the Flie, the Silk-worm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth not prevent its meat; ſo neither doth Gods work prevent the means, by which he deſigneth the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of it. Thus every thing is brought forth in its time, and every work of God is thus made glorious.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God by this means, putteth a wonderful beauty upon his works of Providence.</hi> The beauty of any creature, you know, doth not only lie in the colour of it, and the lovelineſs of that; but in the <hi>Symmetry</hi> and <hi>proportion of all its parts.</hi> Hence our Eye judgeth ſometimes a perſon that is of a good complexion, to have little or nothing of beauty; but a good mixture of colour, with a good <hi>ſymmetry and proportion of parts,</hi> muſt concur to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beauty. <hi>Gods work is perfect, and his ways are Judgment,</hi> Deut. 32.4, and <hi>he is excellent in working,</hi> Jer. 32.19. The glory of the Lord is much concerned, not only in the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of his works; but in the perfection and beauty of it. Now it adds much to the <hi>beauty</hi> of a <hi>work,</hi> when it is brought forth in a fit ſeaſon, and is as an apple of gold in a picture of ſilver. The unlook'd-for concurrence of all circumſtances to the production of any great work of God, makes it appear very admirable in our Eyes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God doth by this means wonderfully glorifie, both his <hi>Power and his Wiſdom,</hi> in the Eyes of the men of the World.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:192227:142"/>1. <hi>His power:</hi> when men ſee the whole Creation ſequacious to his Will and Counſel; that aſſoon as he begins, and ſets out in any work, there is a fudden change in the creature, and all of them follow him in his paths. As the power of a great Prince is herein magnified, all his Subjects poſſibly are ſecure and at quiet, and peace, and think nothing of the Prince's counſels: But no ſooner doth he ſet up his Standard, or cauſe his Drums to be beat up, but preſently all his Subjects are in arms, and ready to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, upon what deſigns he pleaſeth to lead them. This ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth now the great power and influence, this Prince hath upon his Subjects. So now, to obſerve the World as it were all at quiet, and minding no ſuch thing, and God then beginning ſome great work, and as it were ſetting up his Standard; and it is no ſooner up, but all men flock to it, as if it had been a deſign laid amongſt them. To make it plain by an inſtance; The whole World al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt was in a dead ſleep of <hi>Popiſh-ignorance and ſuperſtition,</hi> and in all humane appearance, none thought or dream't of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: God no ſooner proclaimeth his deſign of <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and uſeth <hi>Luther</hi> to ſet up his <hi>ſtandard</hi> at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> 1516; it was but by a pitiful <hi>Monk:</hi> but as if this had been a deſign of a long contrivance in the World, and laid in the ſeveral parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> Duke <hi>Frederick</hi> the <hi>Saxon-Elector,</hi> falls in with him; <hi>Franciſcus Picus Mirandula,</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> perſwades a Reformation, Marqueſs <hi>Caracciolus,</hi> and <hi>Bernhardenus Bonifacius,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Oria</hi> turn Confeſſors at <hi>Naples: Zuinglius</hi> ſtands up for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in <hi>Switzerland; Myconius,</hi> at <hi>Thuring</hi> (I think all in a year) and then other parts in <hi>Germany,</hi> till the Reformation had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the greateſt part of <hi>Germany.</hi> What a wonderful <hi>Specimen</hi> was this of the power of God upon men, upon the hearts of men in the World? yea, and thus the <hi>Wiſdom of God</hi> is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully magnified: for by this means all the World comes to be convinced, that God could not have begun, or done his work in a fitter time. Indeed, God could have done it with equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage at any time, having at all times the hearts of <hi>Princes,</hi> and of all men in his hand: but thoſe that do not ſo wiſtly conſider the influence of God upon mens hearts in the cauſe, and only view hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane circumſtances, when they ſee God bringing forth his work, at a time when the World is prepared and fitted for it, muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the wiſdom of God in it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God doth by this means check the <hi>haſte</hi> and <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitancy,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:192227:142"/>and raſhneſs of our ſpirits, and ſhew us our own folly.</hi> We are very prone to preſcribe to God, and to limit the holy One: <hi>Wilt thou at this time reſtore the kingdom to Iſrael</hi> (ſay the Diſciples)? Now when we ſee God diſappointing our hopes and expectations, and bringing forth his work in his own time; when the worlds circumſtances fit it, and all things concur to it; then we underſtand our own folly and raſhneſs, and that our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are too haſty; then we ſee, that if the work of God had been brought forth in our time, it had not been half ſo eaſily effected, nor half ſo beautiful. Methinks here we are like ſome fooliſh, ignorant children, that view the Carpenter at work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome goodly frame of an houſe: the Carpenter you know, doth his work by degrees; firſt he fitteth one piece, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it by him, then another, and ſo a third: The child vieweth this, and not underſtanding the contrivance, he is every day cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his father to ſet it up; <hi>Father, when do you ſet up the houſe?</hi> ſhall it not go up this day? to morrow, <hi>&amp;c</hi> The child thinks that there is nothing to do, but to ſet up this piece, or that piece: but his wiſer Father, knows that he muſt have every piece fitted and prepared, the joints and the tenons ready to couple one piece to another; or it would be to no purpoſe to begin to ſet up the building, before it were framed, and one part coupled to the other: The child at laſt, when he ſeeth his Father ſet it up all, and the parts fitted one to another, then it begins to ſee its ſelf a fool, and to underſtand that its Father was wiſer than it; againſt another time it learneth wit, to let the Father alone to his own wiſdom, time, and contrivance. The Father might have loſt his pains, and ſpoiled ſome pieces of good timber, and done nothing elſe, in ſooner hearkning to the childs importunity. It may be the child in its haſte, hoiſts up a piece of timber, but it falls down upon him, and bruiſeth him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is much the ſame caſe with us: we look for a <hi>Reformation,</hi> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God will <hi>ſit as a Refiner upon Zion;</hi> we cannot let God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to his own time, till he hath fitted the world's circumſtances to his deſign; but it may be we are <hi>haſtening of God,</hi> not only by modeſt prayers, ſubmitted to his will (which is our duty), but by murmurings and repinings at God: It may be we, like the haſty child, are <hi>hoiſting up ſome pieces of timber,</hi> encouraging ſome or other to begin it irregularly; and by that means get nothing but a knock, or a bruiſe, and loſe ſuch Inſtruments as might have been
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:192227:143"/>uſeful. But at laſt, we ſee God bring forth his work, the world is (as to its circumſtances) fitted to it: then we ſee our folly. <hi>David</hi> was anointed to the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> after this, he is called to Court, he is made the Kings ſon-in-law: If any one upon this ſhould have made a party for <hi>David,</hi> to have rent the Kingdom from <hi>Saul</hi> (a defenſive party he indeed had to protect him from <hi>Sauls</hi> rage, but no more), he had undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but made himſelf a prey. But <hi>David</hi> waiteth year after year, till God had fitted the circumſtances of that Kingdom to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: till <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> were gone, and the peoples hearts were inamoured, and ſet upon <hi>David,</hi> and the Captain of the Army was turned alſo to him; and when theſe circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, then he brings forth his great work, and ſetteth his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>David</hi> peaceably upon the Throne promiſed unto him. Thus far I have enlarged upon the Explicatory part of this Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I now come to the Application of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. In the firſt place, <hi>Let us learn from hence, to adore the wiſdom of God, in his great productions of Providence.</hi> There is much, very much of God to be ſeen, in his great products of Providence: but he is to be ſeen in them, in nothing more than this, his adopting and fitting the world to his deſigns. With how much blood muſt <hi>David</hi> have come to the Kingdom, the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> been brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> had it not been for this? Oh, the infinite, unſearchable wiſdom of God! his footſteps are not known, his ways are paſt a creature's finding out. Wiſdom in action is then much ſeen, when the action is not attempted, but at ſuch a time as it takes effect. The wiſdom of the Smith teacheth him to ſtrike, when the Mettal is hot and malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The wiſe General opens not his trenches, till all is ready to make the Sally, or aſſault: nor ſprings the Mine, till it be carried right under the wall. Herein is the infinite wiſdom of God ſeen, that he attempt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not a great work, until he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated circumſtances to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Secondly, <hi>Obſerve from hence; That the miſcarrying of a good deſign, muſt be the product of mans improvidence; not of Gods directive Providence.</hi> There are many inſtances might be given of mens miſcarrying in a good deſign, that is, in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of things which God will certainly bring to paſs. How many have periſhed, in their undertakings of works of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their works miſcarried? The Providence of God, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:192227:143"/>excluded out of theſe events: it permitted thoſe perſons ſo to act, it governed their action: But it was their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded zeal and ſinful paſſions, and undue precipitancy that cauſed their miſcarriage. God's effective Providence never miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrieth in its deſigns; for it always, either produceth a thing by an almighty-Power, miraculouſly; or elſe ſo fitteth the worlds circumſtances afore-hand, that if it be to be done mediately, it is certainly produced. It is only mans haſte and miſ-guided zeal, that makes any good work abortive. By a good work here, I underſtand, whatſoever is made the Object of a Divine Promiſe; and (by the way) this may teach us, not to let go our hold on the Promiſe, upon any ſuch diſaſter. If the work be of God, if it be any thing which God hath promiſed, it ſhall be effected, though it may miſcarry in a firſt, or ſecond undertaking; either becauſe the Providence of God is driving another deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> in the accompliſhment of it, firſt to puniſh ſome undertakers in it for their ſins, which was the caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> and againſt <hi>Ai;</hi> or for their <hi>precipitancy,</hi> and raſh ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon it out of Gods time; or their ill-managery of it: yet let not your faith fail in the Promiſe, for the work ſhall revive in Gods time, when he hath fitted the Worlds circumſtances a little better to it; it ſhall go on. But thirdly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Let me call upon you to <hi>Obſerve</hi> this in Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Diſpenſations, both towards the Church, and towards your own Souls in particular: <hi>Whoſo is wiſe, obſerveth theſe things</hi> (ſaith the Text), and <hi>he ſhall underſtand the loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord.</hi> This is a very obſervable thing, it will make us ſpiritually wiſe, it will make us to underſtand much of the Lords loving-kindneſs, in the products of his Providence. 1. I ſay firſt, it will <hi>give us ſpiritual wiſdom, and in a great meaſure make us to underſtand Gods time for the production of his great works; and very much guide us, as to our duty in the uſe of means: what, and of what nature is ſeaſonable, and proper for us to make uſe of.</hi> For Example, There is a great expectation of the <hi>Converſion of the Jews;</hi> whether the whole Body of them ſhall be converted, or no, and whether they ſhall return to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and again build, and inhabit, that once holy City, I cannot ſay: But the Scripture ſeemeth to incline very much, That there ſhall be a far greater converſion of them, and calling of them in, than yet hath
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:192227:144"/>been. But to look for this ſuddenly, or to fix it upon any certain year, muſt needs be a very great, an idle and groundleſs vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: we muſt firſt ſee the Worlds circumſtances much better fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, than we yet do; whilſt either the lives, or blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſuch, as it is not reaſonable that Chriſtian Princes ſhould endure them in their Territories; or the ſpirits of Chriſtians are ſuch, as they will not ſo endure them, or ſuch Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries and Superſtitions are amongſt Chriſtians, as are abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that people: the circumſtances of the World do not ſeem fitted to the production of ſuch a great and noble work. If we ſhould live to ſee the bitterneſs of the Jews againſt Chriſt aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the bitterneſs of Chriſtians Spirits againſt them more generally allayed; The lives, and worſhip of Chriſtians more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from ſuch ſuperſtitions as they abominate, and the lives of the <hi>Jews</hi> more reduced to rules of Chriſtians; we might then hope for ſomething of this nature, and judg Gods time at hand. To give another inſtance: <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do believe, or at leaſt did (till of late ſome have began to doubt it) That the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was the great Antichriſt: That wicked one, of whom the Apoſtle prophecied, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8, <hi>that ſhould be revealed, whom God would conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and with the brightneſs of his coming:</hi> He it is, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, <hi>who oppoſeth, and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped; ſo that he as God ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God.</hi> The myſterie of his iniquity began to work, even in the Apoſtle's time, though there was none of many years after owned the name of <hi>Pope;</hi> or arrogant title of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop,</hi> or <hi>Vicar of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. But the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, tells us, there was ſomething which then <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his being revealed, and would let, until he ſhould be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> The <hi>Roman Empire</hi> hindered, nor is that hinderance yet taken away. 'Tis true, there is but a ſtump of that Empire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in <hi>Germany, Spain, France, England,</hi> many other great boughs are lop'd off it; but moſt of them kept their Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian favour, though they changed their temporal <hi>Lords,</hi> and ſet up for, and by themſelves, as to temporal ſubjection and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. You ſee and hear how fierce, the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Portugals,</hi> &amp;c. the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> are for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. 'Tis true, <hi>England</hi> hath broke that yoke off its neck; ſo hath <hi>Holland:</hi> the Goſpel hath got a great foot in <hi>Germany, France, Denmark, Poland, Sweden, Hungary;</hi> but yet the Devil
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:192227:144"/>hath a large Chappel in moſt of thoſe places. It is the National Religion of <hi>France, Spain, Portugal, Italy,</hi> the <hi>Imperial Proper-territories.</hi> God is fitting the circumſtances of the World, much to his promiſed Work; of deſtroying this <hi>Antichriſt with the ſpirit of his mouth, with the brightneſs of his coming. England</hi> is fallen off, <hi>Holland</hi> is fallen off, a great part of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> many Cities and Territories in <hi>Germany, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Denmark;</hi> great numbers in <hi>France.</hi> God is by degrees doing his work, and a great deal is done within the ſpace of a hundred and fifty years laſt paſt (for it is no longer ſince <hi>Luther</hi> began to ſhake his Throne): but yet the circumſtances of the World do not look, as if it were like to be a work we ſhould ſee in our age; nor it may be our childrens children. Methinks the Scripture looks, as if that <hi>man of ſin</hi> ſhould die <hi>a natural death,</hi> not a <hi>violent one.</hi> I mean, that that Religion ſhould be loathed out of the World, not fought out of it; God will conſume it <hi>with the Spirit of his mouth, and with the brightneſs of his coming: Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit</hi> (ſaith the Lord). I tell you but my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that before the fall of Antichriſt, you muſt yet ſee a greater falling off from Popery, by the Princes of other Nations and their people. The Worlds circumſtances do not yet ſeem fitted to that great Work: God may work Miracles in the caſe, but I know no ground we have to expect them. I am very confident that Antichriſt is in his wane, much paſt his full, declining every day; and therefore the fears of ſome, that that ridiculous Religion ſhould again over-ſpread <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> or any other refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church, do not much afflict me: I take that for granted, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is <hi>falling;</hi> but when we ſhall hear that joyful ſound, <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon is fallen, Babylon is fallen,</hi> that I cannot tell you: but in the general I think, we muſt firſt ſee the World otherwiſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced than it is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By this obſervation of the <hi>motions of Providence,</hi> you ſhall alſo <hi>underſtand much of Gods ſet time, as to ſhewing mercy to your own particular ſoul:</hi> viz. <hi>when your bodily, or ſpiritual circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are fitted for the deſired mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay <hi>firſt, when your bodily circumſtances are fitted to it.</hi> There is nothing more evident, than the dependance of our minds upon our bodies, and the influence that ſome bodily diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers (eſpecially) have upon our ſouls and minds: now although it be true, that God can work miraculouſly, and by light can
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:192227:145"/>break through a darkneſs, be it never ſo thick, and raviſh a Soul with unſpeakable joy and peace, though at that time it be yoked to a dark, cloudy, melancholick, diſturbed body: yet God uſeth not to work Miracles ordinarily, but to move in a more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Providence, by the uſe and application of means that are proper: ſo that as it is ſeldom, but God uſeth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and diſturbances of the body, to influence and afflict the mind, and to be (at leaſt an adjuvant) cauſe, when he will trouble a Soul: ſo he uſually reſtoreth health, and a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of body, when he intends to reſtore peace and quiet, and a compoſure of ſpirit; I ſay, ordinarily he doth ſo. And hence again in the next place,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We by giving attendance to this Obſervation, may learn <hi>our duty in reference to the uſe of Means,</hi> ſo as to uſe what is proper to its ſeaſon: for there is great wiſdom to be uſed in apportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing means. For Example: as to the <hi>bringing down of Antichriſt,</hi> if <hi>Gods time be not come,</hi> the means are not, <hi>girding our ſwords up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our thighs,</hi> &amp;c. (I queſtion whether that will ever be a Mean proper to be uſed in that caſe); but endeavouring by all means poſſible, to loath the World of Popiſh ſuperſtitions and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and all the idolatry of that Synagogue, and of all the cheats they put upon the World, and alienate the hearts of people from them. So for <hi>calling the Jews:</hi> the means to be uſed is not inciting them to get into a body, and heading them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to convince them of their errours, to endeavour the ſweetning of their ſpirits, the enlightning their minds with the knowledg of the truth of the Goſpel; and reconciling them to the Chriſtian Religion, and ſhewing them the Examples of an holy life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. So in caſe of particular Souls, where the diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the mind, is originated in, or further advantaged by bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtempers (which is a thing very frequently happening); I do not take it to be the duty of a Chriſtian, meerly to pray and hear, but alſo to uſe natural means proper for the abating of theſe diſtempers: yet not this, without Prayer and uſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, both for the bleſſing of God upon ſuch means, and for the further influences of his ſupernatural grace; for God fitteth the circumſtances of the perſon that is to receive the mercy, to the deſired mercy, when he intendeth the beſtowing of it; as well as the circumſtances of the World, to the mercy which in his ſet-time he intendeth for his Church: ſo, as I ſay, this obſerving of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:192227:145"/>this method of Providence duly attended to, addeth ſpiritual Wiſdom to a Chriſtian, as in <hi>diſcerning</hi> of <hi>Gods time</hi> for mercy; ſo alſo in directing him to his duty, as to proper means to be uſed by him in the way of his duty, in order to the obtaining of the mercy; teaching him to know, <hi>what Iſrael ought to do:</hi> what a good Chriſtian ought to do under the circumſtances, under which God hath brought him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By an attendance to this working of Providence, you ſhall underſtand <hi>much of the loving-kindneſs of the Lord;</hi> very much of the goodneſs and love of God to Nations and Churches, is ſeen in this his fitting of the worlds circumſtances to his deſigns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he produceth them; as his deſigns are effected without <hi>tumult and bloodſhed, which otherwiſe through mens oppoſition to it, would not be avoided.</hi> With how much <hi>bloodſhed</hi> (in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane probability) muſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> have firſt came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> had not God fitted the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the world, to thoſe deſigns of his Providence? Who could have imagined, either the firſt Plantation of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Doctrine and Churches, or the after-reformation of it, when Popery had everywhere obſcured it, had not God by an infinitely-wiſe Providence, firſt fitted the circumſtances of the world to his own works? To give you an inſtance, ſo late, that it is in moſt of your memories. The Reſtauration of our preſent Soveraign, was a great work of Providence; had not God fitted the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the three Nations for ſuch a work, with how much tumult, confuſion, and blood-ſhed muſt it have been effected? It were eaſie to make the ſame obſervation of particular Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, relateing to our ſelves; we ſhall find that God brings forth his works in their ſeaſons, and his ſeaſon is always ſuch as the Wit and Wiſdom of Man, had it been to chuſe, could not have choſen a fitter: <hi>He maketh every thing beautiful in his time</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon).</hi> Indeed this is all the beauty of Providence (almoſt) which we diſcern: Beauty in perſons lyes much in <hi>ſymmetry, or proportion of parts, and mixture of colours:</hi> There is a Beauty of Providence, that lyes in the ſymmetry and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to the revealed Will and Promiſes of God: but the further beauty of Providence lyeth in the ſeaſonableneſs of it, and the fittedneſs of Gods work to the circumſtances of the world, or of our perſons at that time, when he produceth it.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:192227:146"/>And herein we underſtand much of the loving-kindneſs of God. But I ſhall add no more to this Obſervation.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Next to theſe is the whole body of the viſible Church. To the body of the Jews appertained the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the Service of God, and the Promiſes,</hi> Rom. 9.4, 5. And, as the Scripture mentioneth divers priviledges which were peculiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and are to the Church; <hi>as to have the Oracles of God, the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo doubtleſs there are many promiſes which relate to the whole body of the Church,</hi> which argue Gods peculiar kindneſs to that body of people.

Now the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I make, is but a further evidence of this love, that God by his Providence diſpoſeth and governeth the affairs of the world, in a juſt ſubordination to the good of his Church; and to thoſe wiſe ends, which with reference to that he is bringing about: and this is true, both in reference to the <hi>Pagan</hi> world, and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world; according to the deſign which God hath, by which he doth deſign to do good to his <hi>whole Church;</hi> ſo he diſpoſeth and governeth the affairs of the <hi>Pagan world.</hi> And according to the deſign God hath, by which he deſigns to bring about good to the ſincere Servants of God in any place; ſo he diſpoſeth, ordereth and governeth the affairs of ungodly men, amongſt whom they live.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As to the variety of the ſame people's ſpirits,</hi> with reference to the Church of God, and thoſe eſpecially in it, that walk more fully and cloſe with God. It is matter of aſtoniſhment to thoſe who do not wiſtly conſider <hi>the wheel within the wheel, or the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the living God within the wheels,</hi> upon which all the great actions of the world do turn: the world is ſometimes all in an uproar againſt thoſe they nickname <hi>Puritans,</hi> that is, ſuch as <hi>exerciſe themſelves to keep a good conſcience, both towards God, and towards men,</hi> (for that is the true deſcription of ſuch a perſon); and if profane and carnal men hate ſome that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in their Converſation, it is but their miſtake, for they think them ſo; holineſs and ſtrict walking, is the thing they hate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, and maligne: <hi>If you were of the world</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>the world would love its own; but becauſe you are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you,</hi> John 15.19. ſometimes again the ſcene is quite altered, that of the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> is fulfilled:

                     <hi>Ten men take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,</hi> ſaying, <hi>We will go with you, for we have heard that the Lord is with you:</hi> men ſtand amazed at this. The People of God are the ſame, walk in the ſame method of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: but the hand of God is in the thing. Sometimes God deſigneth in his external Providence to ſmile upon his people, and give them ſome breathing-time, a few halcion-days; then they ſhall find favour in the eyes of the great men of the Earth, and of their leſſer neighbours: another time he deſigneth to ſcourge and chaſten his people, then every ones ſpirit ſhall be up, and their tongues let looſe againſt them. Thus it was with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Gods ancient people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 11.7. <hi>But againſt any of the children of Iſrael, ſhall not a dog move his tongue.</hi> The <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> telleth us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.23, 24. <hi>That Iſrael came into Egypt, and Jacob ſojourned in the land of Ham, and he increaſed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple greatly, and made them ſtronger than their enemies,</hi> Verſ. 25. <hi>He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal ſubtilly with his ſervants.</hi>

There is nothing more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Divine Providence than this is: Who ſeeth, and is not aſtoniſhed, ſometimes to obſerve the ſtrange difference in the complexion and inclinations of the wicked world, to Gods little remnant in it? The ebbing and flowing of the Tide (of which none that I know hath as yet given the world a ſatisfactory account) is not ſo unaccountable a thing as this is. If we do not admit of the hypotheſis of this Obſervation; Will not any one be amazed to conſider how the Goſpel ſhould at firſt have gotten any footing in the world, but for this? What a ſtrange thing it was, that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, the harbinger of our bleſſed Lord, ſhould be ſuffered to come preaching in the wilderneſs; and ſo plainly to point out the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and all <hi>Judea,</hi> and all the Region round about <hi>Jordan,</hi> ſhould go out to him, confeſs their ſins, and be baptized of him: that immediately upon this Chriſt ſhould come, and meet with that acceptance he did, though indeed it was true, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of his own received him not. That firſt the ſeventy, and then the twelve ſhould go out to Preach the Goſpel, and <hi>Paul</hi> alone ſhould carry it from <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illyricum;</hi> and the great perſecutions ſhould not ariſe, till the Goſpel had got ſuch a footing, that it was not to be rooted out; but they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tended to the furtherance, than to the hinderance of it. I ſay theſe were all ſtrange things to him, that conſidereth not how God, to this great end, ſubordinated the affairs of the world. The <hi>Jews</hi> were then tributary to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſo
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:192227:149"/>in no capacity to ſhew themſelves ſuch hinderers of this, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they otherwiſe would have been: The <hi>Romans</hi> were a great while more careleſs in the matters of Religion; while the Goſpel continued in <hi>Judea,</hi> it made little noiſe in the world, and was looked upon but as a diviſion amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion: in which the great maſters of the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned not themſelves ſo much; and when the Apoſtles firſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Goſpel amongſt the Heathens, it was at firſt little ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, while the Chriſtians grew very numerous; ſo as ten perſecutions, ſucceeding one another, could not root them out; and the ſame thing you ſhall conſtantly obſerve in any great works of Providence relating to the Church. It could not have been thought, that <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> ſhould have ſo eaſily fallen in with the carrying on of the Reformation, if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God had not firſt fitted the world for it, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of Princes, the diverſity of their intereſts, by ſuffering the ignorance and ſottiſhneſs of the Popiſh-Clergy, together with their covetouſneſs, ambition and debauchery, to grow to that heighth, that they grew an abomination to all men.</p>
                  <p>And as it is in the Political and Eccleſiaſtical body, ſo it is as to the particular perſons of Chriſtians; the Providence of God (ordinarily) diſpoſeth the body, according to the work which he hath to do upon the ſoul. But that is more forreign to my obſervation, therefore I ſhall not inlarge upon it. Beſides that I ſpake ſomething to it under the former obſervation, which hath ſome cognation with this, this only differing from it in this, ſhewing you, that the Providence of God doth not make the Church lacquey to the world, but he makes the world lacquey to the Church; and ſubordinateth the buſineſs of the world to his own great deſigns, relating to the Church. Now if you ask me the reaſon of this, it doubtleſs lyeth,</p>

                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:192227:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>true worſhip is, and where he hath placed to himſelf a Tabernacle; though God had a kindneſs for the whole ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet he loved the <hi>gates of Sion</hi> above all <hi>the dwellings of Jacob,</hi> becauſe that was the place where his worſhip was regularly performed. It holds ſtill under the New Teſtament, and will hold to the end of the world; whereſoever God hath a Church, or people, he hath a particular kindneſs for that people: they are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called the <hi>houſe of God.</hi> God is ſaid to dwell, and walk amongſt them; and God hath yet a more particular favour to thoſe that are the inviſible part of the viſible Church; I mean ſuch as truly belong unto God, <hi>that worſhip him in ſpirit, and in truth; that fear the Lord, and hope in his mercies,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt expreſſeth it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18. All the world is nothing to God, in compariſon of this little flock, to whom it is his will to give a Kingdom: He hath given them his Chriſt, and ſhall he not with him give them all things? This were eaſily to be proved to you from a variety of Scripture, and arguments drawn from thence. Now ſuppoſing this, it is no wonder if he ſubordinateth his works in the world, to his deſigns here: This is that <hi>Canaan</hi> which the Lord careth for, and upon which his eyes are from one end of the year to another, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. His heritage, the dearly beloved of his ſoul, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.7. His peculiar treaſure, his ſiſter, his ſpouſe, the redeemed and ranſomed of the Lord, his portion; in ſhort, there is a multitude of expreſſions, by which God hath ſhewen that his Church, the whole body of people owning and profeſſing him; and eſpecially thoſe of them, that worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, and walk up to the rule of his word, are dearer to him than all the world beſides. He calls them his bride, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.9. His beloved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.6. His build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. His City, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. His choſen generation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. His family, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.15. His husbandry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. His Kingdom, the lot of his inheritance. Now conſidering this, it is no wonder at all, that the Providence of God ſhould manage all the affairs of the world, in ſubordination to his deſigns, for the good of this body. All the relation of God to others, is but that of a <hi>Creator;</hi> and they are no better than the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of Satan, as to the Divine Worſhip that is in them: and the throne of Satan, with reſpect to the homage of their Converſation: They are called <hi>children of wrath,</hi> of <hi>diſobedience,</hi> of the <hi>curſe, ſtrangers,</hi> and <hi>forreiners.</hi> If God ſometimes gives
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:192227:151"/>up his people into the hands of wicked men, it is either, 1. <hi>For his peoples good, to purge away their droſs, and take away their tinn</hi> (as the Prophet expreſſeth it), <hi>or for to ripen ſinners for their deſtruction,</hi> that they may by it <hi>fill up the meaſure of their iniquities.</hi> Methinks you have a full proof of this Obſervation, in the 105 Pſalm: the Pſalmiſt in that Pſalm, is calling the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> to give thanks unto the Lord, to ſing unto him, to talk of all his wondrous works. Then followeth a recapitulation of thoſe great things which God had done for them; amongſt which, this is reckoned, that he ſubordinated his motions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence amongſt the men, and the nations of the world, to his gracious deſigns for them; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>He ſuffered no man to do them wrong; yea he reproved Kings for their ſake; ſaying, Touch not mine anointed, do my prophets no harm;</hi> and ſo he goes on, almoſt quite through that Pſalm. Now I ſay, the reaſon of all this was, his love ſet upon this people. As moſt of us have ſome particular perſons, that our heart is moſt ſet upon; ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt and deſign that we drive on: now whoever thoſe perſons be, or whatever that deſign be, we make all the reſt of our actions to be ſubordinate to that. So the great God having ſet up his glory as his great intereſt and deſign, and ſet apart him and them that are godly for himſelf; it is no wonder at all if he ruleth all the world, and governeth all the affairs of it, in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to this great intereſt, and the good of this people. I now come to the Application of this Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. In the firſt place (as I ſaid before upon the other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, ſo I ſay here): <hi>From hence a wiſe and obſerving Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, may in a great meaſure know, what weather it is like to be in the Climate of the Church:</hi> How it is like to fare with them that are the People of God. They are, and always were the far leſſer part of the world; and their quiet and tranquillity (to look with a rational eye) doth much depend upon the complexion of the men of the world, and their inclinations: if God intends a calm and tranquillity to the Church, he uſually ſo ordereth the world, that the <hi>earth helps the woman,</hi> the men of the world, either out of good nature, or (which indeed moſtly is the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs) out of intereſt, ſhew them kindneſs. Hence you ſhall obſerve, that when God intendeth the tranquillity and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, his Providence (ordinarily) bringeth one of theſe things to paſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:192227:152"/>1. <hi>He ſometimes raiſeth up ſome eminent ſervant of his, to do great ſervices for the men of the world:</hi> this you ſee in the caſe of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> God had deſigned the <hi>Jews</hi> a proſpering, multiplying time in the land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> he raiſeth up <hi>Joſeph,</hi> makes him a Privy-Counſellor to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> yea the ſecond man in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and this by endowing him with a power to interpret <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dream, ſo he came to be a great man, and was a protection to the Church of God for many years in <hi>Egypt.</hi> So when they were in the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> we do not read, that beſides their Captivity, and their want of their worſhip at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> their condition was very ſad; but in the peace of that Countrey, they had peace, yet they were amongſt Heathens and Idolaters: but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God raiſed up <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>three Children,</hi> and by giving them great Wiſdom, and ſome miraculous deliverances of them, he brought them into a great credit; and <hi>Daniel</hi> was made firſt Preſident over 120 Provinces. God deſigned after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Jews</hi> peaceable building of the Temple, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own land; his Providence brings <hi>Eſther</hi> (one of them) to be Queen, makes uſe of <hi>Mordecay</hi> to diſcover a great treaſon, and by this means brings theſe two eminent friends to his Church, into great reputation. The like might be parallel'd all along in ſtory, and may be every day obſerved: but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-inſtances are enough.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometimes the Providence of God makes the Earth to help the woman, by making his people the ballance to the claſhing intereſts of the men of the world:</hi> and this is a very ordinary method of Divine Providence. The men of the world are not always friends one with another; if they were (in humane probability) the Church would quickly be ſwallowed up. But their luſts will not ſuffer them always to agree, and then the Providence of God (ordinarily) maketh his Church the ballance: and ſo they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peace and protection, either by a <hi>neutrality,</hi> not engaging on either ſide, or by ſtrengthening the weaker party againſt the ſtronger, where the caſe is ſuch, that they can do it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency to their duty to God, and religious principles. <hi>David</hi> with his little company, upon this account doubtleſs, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the King of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> a while.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Sometimes the Providence of God raiſeth up his people to ſuch a conſiderableneſs, as to the commerce and trade of a Nation; that they cannot be rooted out, without cutting the ſinews of a nation,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:192227:152"/>and breaking the ſtrength of it.</hi> The Prince (who <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith is ſerved by the field) is concerned as to his revenue; the poor are highly concerned as to their employment and livelihood; it may be many of the maddeſt of their Enemies are concerned; for there is a ſtrange twiſting of all mens intereſts in the trade and commerce of a Nation. This is another way by which the Providence of God helpeth and maketh the earthy part of the world to help the <hi>Woman</hi> his Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sometimes the Providence of God ſuffers the maddeſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his people, to run out to ſuch ſtrange <hi>extravagancies</hi> of <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> and <hi>injuſtice,</hi> of <hi>folly,</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> in worſhip, of <hi>looſeneſs</hi> and <hi>debauchery</hi> in morals; that the ſoberer part of men, though no great friends to the practice and power of godlineſs, yet is not able to bear them, but chuſe rather to take the part of them with whom they agree better in matters of civil juſtice, and ſobriety, and temperance, though not at all better in matters of true Religion and Godlineſs. This was the very caſe in the beginning of Reformation, both in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other places: The Providence of God having deſigned a better time for the true worſhippers of him, had ſo ordered it in his great Wiſdom, that the Church men of the Popiſh party, had made themſelves a juſt abomination to all ſober perſons; the generality of their watch-men were ſuch as they were in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> juſt before their ruin deſcribed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.10. <hi>His watch-men are blind, they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, that cannot bark, ſleeping, loving to ſlumber; yea they are greedy dogs, that can never have enough; and ſhepheards that cannot underſtand, they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter: Come you, ſay they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant.</hi> Juſt ſuch a Clergy they had in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and other parts too before the reformation. Some learned men they had, but they (for the moſt part) ſpent their ſtudies and pains about trifles in Divinity, ſubtil ſchool-niceties and diſtinctions, ſignifying nothing to mens ſalvation: the generality of them were drunken ſots, and debauched perſons, <hi>dumb dogs that could not bark;</hi> neither pray, nor preach, nor ſay any thing (almoſt) beyond what they had in their maſs-books; but thought to have carried all before them, with the forms of a few latine Prayers, their Albes and Stoles, and Levitical habits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:192227:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>they were <hi>greedy dogs</hi> too, never thinking they had enough. This was that ruined them, their ſelling men <hi>pardons</hi> for a ſum of money, every one looking for his tythes and oblations, but none regarding peoples ſouls. And by the way, obſerve this, <hi>A generally debauched, ignorant, ſottiſh, cruel Clergy, is a certain ſign, either of an approaching ruin to that nation, or to that party, by a reformation of the nation.</hi> To the <hi>Jews</hi> it was a prognoſtick of an approaching ruin: <hi>All you beaſts of the field come to devour, yea all you beaſts of the forreſt</hi> (ſaith the Prophet), <hi>his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are blinded,</hi> &amp;c. Upon the reformation from Popery, it was a prognoſtick of reformation, and indeed ſo it is ordinarily, where there is not <hi>like people, like prieſts.</hi> But God keepeth up in any conſiderable number of people, an abomination and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of thoſe Prieſts, and their courſes; but where they fall in with them, applaud, patronize them, and theſe are the men they are for, <hi>The interpretation be to thoſe that hate that people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that I ſay, from hence obſerving Chriſtians may make a great judgment, how it is likely to go with the Church: you muſt lay down this for a principle, <hi>That no wicked men have any hearty love and affection for thoſe that are the people of God.</hi> There is an Enmity which God hath put betwixt the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the ſerpent, and nothing but grace will wear it out; beſides, they ſee themſelves ſhamed, and condemned every day by their contrary converſation. It is only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the men of the world, that gives them any breathing-time, and maketh the <hi>earth to help the woman.</hi> So that if at any time you can but make up a judgment, from what quarter the the wind blows for the men of the worlds intereſt, you may go a great way to determine, how at ſuch a time it is like to fare with the Church and People of God: for God ordinarily ſubordinates his government of the world, to his deſigns with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Church. If there happens to be ſuch a juncture of affairs, that the People of God are few in any place, like a glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of grapes after a vintage, or an Olive-berry or two upon the top-boughs; there is little good to be hoped for, unleſs God by his Providence makes ſome particular perſons amongſt them highly ſerviceable, or inſtrumental in the ſtate where they live; either diſcovering ſome plots or treaſons (which was the caſe in <hi>Mordecai's</hi> time), or brings ſome of them to ſome great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which was the cauſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> firſt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> then
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:192227:153"/>in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Eſther</hi> afterwards upon their return from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon; or elſe God by his Providence ſecureth his little flock, by ſuffering ſome inteſtine factions to riſe amongſt the men of the world, or ſtirring up other enemies againſt that part of the world,</hi> that they have ſomething elſe to do, and cannot attend the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their malice upon the ſervants of God: or bleſſeth a particular ſtate with a good-natured Prince, that is not enclined to rigour and ſeverity, but naturally abhorreth the blood and ruin of people: though uſually, if the latter be the caſe, it is but an incertain time with the Church; for good natures are ordinarily with eaſe enclined this way or that, according to the mutability of prevailing Counſels.</p>
                  <p>But now if the People of God in any nation be a conſiderable number, and you ſee the Providence of God hath raiſed them up, to be men of intereſt many of them, either with reſpect to their Wiſdom, or Eſtates, or Imployments; though their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be many and boiſterous, yet there is no great fear (unleſs of particular perſons ſuffering): God ſeems to have ſubordinated the world to their peace. For though ſome few imprudent men, that are raſh and malicious, and ſome hot-ſpur'd Church-men, who underſtand little of politicks, may in ſuch a juncture be for nothing but fire and faggot: yet God, who in his Providence hath ordered civil affairs ſo, that it ſhould be the intereſt of the men of the world to give them liberty and peace, will ſeldom ſuffer thoſe whom he hath betruſted with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the affairs of the world (unleſs he deſigneth to bring a period to the ſtate) ſo far to overlook their intereſts, as to gratifie the luſts of malicious and raſh men.</p>
                  <p>Again, If you ſee in any place, God ſuffering men calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Miniſters, to degenerate into ſuch ſots in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, or to run into ſuch heighths of ſuperſtitious vanities and fooleries, as all men condemn and ſee the vanity of; or to be ſo inſufficient for any part of their work, that they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, but are contemptible unto all, and make the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God to be abhorred: This is another juncture of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, when you may either fear the ruin of the place, or hope for a reformation, or more quiet abode for Gods People in it. And (by the way) my enlargement upon this Obſervation, may mind the People of God of the Policy, as well as Piety of a threefold duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:192227:154"/>1. The firſt is, <hi>All juſt homage and ſerviceableneſs unto ſuch rulers as God hath ſet over the places wherein their lot is caſt:</hi> I ſay juſt homage, <hi>for it is better to obey God than Man;</hi> and we cannot obey Man, where Obedience to him is diſobedience to God. But the more any of our conſciences towards God ſtraitens us, as to ſome points of Obedience, the more we ſhould be ſerviceable in what we may. If it at any time falls in our way to ſecure their lives, by diſcovering dangerous plots and conſpiracies; <hi>Mordecay</hi> by ſuch a ſervice, made himſelf the Protector of all the people of the <hi>Jews.</hi> If we be called to it, and can aſſiſt them with our arms, with our wiſdom, counſel, with our ſervice and induſtry; remember what great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the good of Gods People, <hi>Joſeph, Daniel,</hi> the three Children, <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> &amp;c. were made.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obſerve here <hi>alſo the Policy, as well as Piety of the practice of all moral virtue: Juſtice to all, charity and liberality</hi> to the poor, <hi>temperance, ſobriety,</hi> all manner of lovelineſs in Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there muſt be ſomething more than theſe things to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to God: but theſe are the things that muſt commend you to the world. Moral vertue hath a great cognation with humane Nature: though mens luſts and paſſions ſometimes run them out to acts of injuſtice, and oppreſſion, and debauchery; yet no body would willingly himſelf be oppreſſed, or dealt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly with, or have his own wife and daughters debauched. It is very rare but the higheſt and maddeſt Enemies of the People of God are malicious and debauched perſons; few of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of moral vertue and honeſty: make but your ſelves great Examples of theſe things, and you will certainly at one time or other be too hard for your adverſaries; the world ſo loatheth their injuſtice, cruelty, oppreſſion, hard-heartedneſs, their drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and uncleanneſs, their lying, cheating, and defrauding, that it will vomit them out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It lets you alſo ſee the Policy, as well as Piety, of <hi>keeping cloſe to God in the matters of his worſhip.</hi> The ſottiſhneſs and ſuperſtition of Prieſts ſignifieth good, not hurt to you, unleſs you approve of their ſavings and doings: <hi>But when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets prophecy falſly, and the prieſts bear rule by their means, and the people love to have it ſo: what will you do in the end thereof?</hi> Jer. 5.32. If the miniſtry in any nation be ſottiſh in their lives, corrupt in their Doctrines, ſuperſtitious in their
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:192227:154"/>Worſhip, dumb dogs, that can neither pray nor preach, <hi>let not the people love to have it ſo,</hi> and comply with them, and own them. God will not long ſuffer his flock to be rent in pieces with ſuch wolves, nor be at the will of ſuch idol-ſhepherds. But I have enlarged far enough upon this firſt branch of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, I ſhall be ſhorter in the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obſerve from hence both <hi>the felicity and duty of the people of God.</hi> 1. Their <hi>felicity and dignity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their dignity. I remember the Pſalmiſt admiring the mercy of God towards man, and expreſſing his Dignity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.6, 7. <hi>Thou madeſt him to have dominion over the work of thy hands, thou haſt put all things under his feet: all ſheep, and oxen, yea and the beaſts of the field, the fouls of the air, and the fiſh of the ſea, and whatſoever paſſeth through the ſeas.</hi> This is a great dignity of man, that God hath ſubordinated all the works of Creation, all the orders of Creatures beneath him, unto him. But what a dignity is this to which God hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced his Church, that all the affairs of the world ſhould be (as it were) <hi>put under their feet?</hi> that they ſhould not only have a dominion over the works of the Lords hands in Creation, as ſheep, and neat cattel, and fouls, and fiſhes, but alſo all the Lords works of Providence: that the Kingdoms of the Earth, and the great affairs of ſtates ſhould be ruled with reference to the good of this little flock. What a <hi>felicity</hi> it is to be within this hedg, to be a member of this body of people; I mean a true member of the Church of God? I know the whole viſible Church (as I have before ſhewed you) is under a <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence:</hi> But it is not to be thought that God ſhould do much for Hypocrites and Formaliſts: What advantages they have from the Providence of God, they have for the ſake of thoſe better ſervants of God, with whom they are joyned in an external communion. And certainly in the laſt place, this obligeth all within the Church of God, to a more ſpecial duty. Doth God ſubordinate all his great actions and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world, to his gracious deſigns and counſels rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to that body of people of which we are a part? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then it were but reaſonable for us to ſubordinate all our <hi>little actions in the world, to the honour and glory of God:</hi> Gods glorifying of himſelf is his great deſign, he aims at no other end, and it ought alſo to be our higheſt deſign. He
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:192227:155"/>hath choſen a certain people out of the world, and marked them out for himſelf, as the people in whom, and by whom he will be more eſpecially glorified: This people is called <hi>his Church.</hi> God ſubordinateth all his great actions in the world to his gracious deſigns upon, and for theſe; certainly in reaſon, <hi>Whether we eat or drink, or whatſoever we do, we ſhould</hi> (according to the Apoſtles Precept) <hi>do all to the glory of God.</hi> His people are thoſe whom he hath created, whom he hath formed for himſelf; all the world is nothing to God in compariſon of them, they are the dearly beloved of his Soul. What love, reverence, obedience is but reaſonable on our parts towards this great God? What ingratitude muſt it argue on our part, to prefer any thing in deſign or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Honour and Glory of this God? We can never live enough unto, nor do enough for that God, who hath done, and doth do ſo much for us. This Obſervation might be many other ways improved, but I ſhall add no more.</p>

                  <p>I Proceed yet in making ſome Obſervations upon the motions of Divine Providence. A ſeventh Obſervation I ſhall make, is this:</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 7. <hi>It ordinarily enforceth wicked men, who mean nothing leſs, yet to do the Lords work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:192227:155"/>
                  <p>It is the great art of a Politician to ſerve himſelf of every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor: A good Pen-man will write almoſt with any Pen, and a good work-man will work with any tool; and the great and wiſe God herein ſheweth the greatneſs of his Wiſdom, that he alſo works with any tools, and doth his buſineſs by any inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Stars ſhall fight in their courſes, againſt <hi>Sizera;</hi> the Sun, and the Moon, againſt the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> the Frogs, the Lice, and the Flyes againſt <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> the Earth againſt <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> Now in this there ſhines forth a great deal of Divine Power; thus God ſheweth himſelf to the world, to be the <hi>Lord of hoſts,</hi> to have all the hoſts of Heaven and Earth at his command. So that as a <hi>great General,</hi> who hath ſeveral Regiments under his Command, at his pleaſure, he ſometimes commandeth out one, ſometimes another, as it pleaſeth him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a particular ſervice: ſo doth our great and mighty God; and as that great Commander, ſhewing his vaſt Army to his friend, is reported to have ſaid, there is not one of theſe, but if I bid him throw himſelf down a Precipice, or into a River, he will do it: ſo there is not any company of inanimate, or brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not one Company in the whole Army of the Lord of Hoſts; but like the <hi>Centurion's</hi> ſervants, if he ſaith unto them, Go, they go; if Do this, they do it. But though much of the Wiſdom and Power of God be ſeen in this, yet it is more eminently ſeen in the uſe he makes of wicked men, to accompliſh his deſigns, which is a thing very uſual in the motions of Divine Providence. As that <hi>Politician</hi> doth moſt ſhew his Wiſdom, that maketh his Enemies ſerve him; ſo God in this doth commend to us his infinite Wiſdom, to make uſe of the Sons of men, that have a perfect hatred and enmity to God, and all his holy deſigns, that they ſhall ſerve him, and accompliſh his deſigns. Now this Obſervation juſtifieth it ſelf by a great variety of inſtances. You have one in holy Writ very plain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. <hi>O Aſſyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the ſtaff in their hand is mine indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: I will ſend him againſt an hypocritical nation, and againſt the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the ſpoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them like mire of the ſtreets: Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria</hi> you ſee was the Rod of Gods anger: Gods indignation was <hi>his ſtaff: Thou couldeſt do nothing againſt me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Pilate, if it were not given thee from above.</hi> He went upon
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:192227:156"/>Gods errand, when he went againſt Gods People the <hi>Jews;</hi> they had proved an hypocritical people, and God had determined to make the people, that had been the dearly beloved of his ſoul, the people of his wrath: God gave him his charge to ſpoil, to take the prey, to tread down the people. O but how ſhould God perſwade the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> to ſerve him? The <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were Enemies to the true God; the Text telleth you, <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he meaneth not ſo: neither is it in his heart to think ſo.</hi> He thought of nothing leſs than ſerving of Gods deſign, that which he thought of was plunder and ſpoyl, and prey for his Soldiers, as the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Being crafty, I took you by guile;</hi> ſo we may ſay of God, being wiſe, infinitely wiſe, he took the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> by guile; or rather by his infinite wiſdom. This is that which the Pſalmiſt ſaith <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.10. <hi>Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee:</hi> The wrath of man ſhall praiſe God: How can that be! <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>That the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God:</hi> Well, but for all that it ſhall praiſe God; God will make uſe of their wrath and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, to bring forth his great deſigns. Who would ever have thought, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould have been a great inſtrument to have brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> Yet he was rather a greater inſtrument in it than <hi>Moſes</hi> was: <hi>Moſes</hi> did no more than lead out of <hi>Egypt</hi> a willing people, and ſollicit <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to give his conſent: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to make them willing; he meant nothing leſs, he ſaw the people grew great and mighty, <hi>Come on</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let us deal wiſely</hi> (that is, ſubtilly) <hi>with them, leſt they multiply, and it come to paſs when there falleth out any war, they joyn alſo unto our enemies, and fight againſt us, and ſo get themſelves out of our land:</hi> here was all he aimed at in his oppreſſing them, to bring them low, and keep them ſtill under his ſubjection. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how God made uſe of this. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were now ſeated and ſettled, and multiplied in a fertile Countrey, and had it not been for the King of <hi>Egypt's</hi> oppreſſing them, would never have been willing to have left the fleſh-pots, and onions, and garlick of <hi>Egypt:</hi> but for this dealing of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with them, making them to ſerve with rigour, ſlaying their male-children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This quite tyred them, and made them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go out of <hi>Egypt</hi> towards <hi>Canaan.</hi> But let me a little
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:192227:156"/>ſhew you what a variety of luſts in wicked mens hearts, God hath from time to time made uſe of, to accompliſh the great deſigns of his Providence, with reference to his people: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is hard to ſay, what luſt in ſinners hearts God hath not made uſe of (at one time or other), and made it to ſerve the holy and wiſe deſigns of his Providence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The luſts of the eye and fleſh,</hi> are of all other the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike brutiſh paſſions; yet the Providence of God hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken advantage of theſe for the glory of God. You all know what a ſtrange influence <hi>Eſther's</hi> being advanced to be Queen of <hi>Perſia,</hi> had upon Gods deſign for the building of the ſecond Temple in <hi>Ezra's</hi> time; ſhe was the great inſtrument to ſave the whole Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> (the only Church God had upon the Earth at that time) from utter ruin. God made uſe of the luſt of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> to bring this about; he takes a Teach to <hi>Vaſthi,</hi> for refuſing to come to him, to be ſhown to his Princes, and turns her away, and then muſt look for the greateſt beauty could be found: <hi>Eſther</hi> proveth to be ſhe. What a ſtrange inſtance of this had we of this in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth of that name in this Nation? Thoſe who know any thing of the ſtory of thoſe times, know, that it was no abhorrence of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superſtition of the Popiſh-Religion, that ſet him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the work of Reformation. After ſome beginnings of it, the <hi>ſix Articles</hi> came out: Papiſts were burnt on one ſide of <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> Proteſtants on the other: but the King was weary of his Wife, and had a mind to another. His wife indeed was one whom Proteſtant-Divines judged he could not keep (having been his brothers wife) without a continual living in inceſt; the Pope (who thinks he can diſpenſe with any thing) he thinks or decrees ſhe was his wife, and would give no diſpenſation for a divorce; the Popiſh-Univerſities, and Divines (who never fail to be on their holy Fathers ſide) all oppoſe the King in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of change: This angers the King, and was the firſt motive to his buſineſs of Reformation, and caſting off the Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy. Nor is this any reproach at all to the Lords work of Reformation amongſt us; there's nothing more ordinary, than for God to make the wrath of man to praiſe him, and make uſe of the luſts of men, to bring about his own deſigns.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Ambition is another luſt, which fireth the heart of wicked men,</hi> eſpecially great men. It is an exceſſive deſire of <hi>Honour</hi>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:192227:157"/>and <hi>Dominion.</hi> Poor wretches, born to, and brought up in little circumſtances, and low ſtations in the world, are ordinarily not ſo much infected with this; it is the great mans luſt. God makes an eminent uſe of this. See it in the caſe of <hi>Jehu,</hi> a proud ambitious man, that had in him a great luſt, and deſire of rule and honour; God had a quarrel againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> by his Providence he ordereth <hi>Jehu</hi> to the Kingdom, makes uſe of him to deſtroy <hi>Joram,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> the King of <hi>Judah</hi> the Son-in law of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, Ahab's</hi> wife, whom God had threatned for the blood of <hi>Naboth,</hi> and his whole Family, until none remained, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23, 24, 25. <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10, 24, 27, 35, <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 11, 17. And thus he delivered his ſeven thouſand in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that had not bowed <hi>knee to Baal,</hi> from the idolatry, cruelty, and oppreſſion of a vile and wicked Prince. <hi>Jehu</hi> indeed in all this, pretended a great zeal for God, and did deſtroy <hi>Baal</hi> from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.28; but yet <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Howbeit from the ſins of Jeroboam, the ſon of Nebat, who made Iſrael to ſin, Jehu departed not from after them; to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</hi> Verſ. 31. <hi>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the way of the Lord God of Iſrael, with all his heart, for he departed not from the ſins of Jeroboam, who made Iſrael to ſin.</hi> Hence it was, that though the Lord tells him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.30. <hi>That he had done well in executing that which was right in the eyes of God, and had done according to all that was in Gods heart, as to the houſe of Ahab;</hi> and therefore promiſed him a reward for it, <hi>viz.</hi> that for it, <hi>his children of the fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſhould ſit on the throne of Iſrael;</hi> yet God by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea</hi> told them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the houſe of Jehu:</hi> The buſineſs was no more than this. <hi>Jehu</hi> was an ambitious Prince, that loved <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>dominion,</hi> the Providence of God maketh uſe of this luſt of his, to bring about his holy and righteous deſigns upon that wicked family of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and for the delivery of his people from their oppreſſions. This was the caſe of <hi>Haman,</hi> a proud ambitious Courtier in the Court of <hi>Perſia;</hi> he had a mind to be great, this made him malice <hi>Mordecay,</hi> he would not bow his knee to him; this made him propoſe ſuch great things to be done, to the man whom the King ſhould pleaſe to ſhew favour and honour to; the Text tells you he ſaid, <hi>To whom will the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:192227:157"/>King delight to do honour, more than to my ſelf?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſt. 6.6.</note> God maketh uſe of his ambition to bring <hi>Mordecay</hi> into honour, and to ſave the whole people of the <hi>Jews:</hi> and thus it ordinarily falls out in leſſer ſpheres; the humble diſpoſition of Gods People incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to give honour, to whom honour belongeth, and not to deny civil reſpects to the worſt of men, doth often commend them to thoſe that are ambitious of honour and reſpect, and maketh them their friends; God making uſe of his Enemies am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition for their ſake, which by the way commendeth to all that fear God, that Precept of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Render therefore to every one their dues, tribute to whom tribute, cuſtom to whom cuſtom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another luſt of men, which you ſhall find Gods Providence hath made great uſe of, is <hi>curioſity.</hi> A curioſity to know ſecrets: What ſhall come to paſs in after-times? or a <hi>curioſity</hi> to delight in rare <hi>workmanſhip of any ſort,</hi> &amp;c? This is a great vanity of the heart of man; but the Providence of God hath made great uſe of it. Of the firſt ſort, there are in holy Writ the inſtances of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> both of them dreamed dreams, wherein God revealed to them things that were to come to paſs in the world. Then God inſpireth <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a great friend to his people, and <hi>Daniel</hi> with wiſdom to interpret theſe dreams to them: this brought them both into high and great favour with thoſe mighty Princes, in ſubjection to whom the <hi>Jews</hi> at thoſe times were. This indeed is not an ordinary work of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but what God hath done. The ſecond is more ordinary, men have a curioſity to ſee, and have fine pieces of work done, to hear rare muſick, to ſee fine mathematical operations. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome of theſe things are very uſeful, but a curioſity in many of them, is but vanity; <hi>Solomon</hi> after a long experience, ſo concludes it: but the wiſe God often makes a moſt remarkable uſe of this luſt in mens hearts. <hi>David's</hi> skill at his harp brought him to Court. And many ſober perſons skill, dexterity, and activity in arts and ſciences, hath made them very acceptable to thoſe that have had the power of the world in their hands, and put them into great capacities to ſerve the intereſt of God in the world: where God hath both ſhewed his Wiſdom, in making uſe of mens luſt of curioſity for his own glory; and alſo in making his own common and ordinary gifts ſo ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alſo.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:192227:158"/>4. A fourth luſt, which you ſhall obſerve God to make an ordinary uſe of, is that of <hi>covetouſneſs.</hi> The People of God many times buy their peace and tranquillity; ſometimes they obtain it by their uſefulneſs in trade and traffick, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment the publick revenue would have by rooting them out: ſometimes they make themſelves friends with their induſtrious hands, ſometimes with their liberal hand: This was but our Saviours counſel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Make to your ſelves friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> It is particularly ſaid of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he was a ſervant to <hi>Potiphar,</hi> Gen. 39.2, 3. <hi>That the Lord was with Joſeph, and he was a proſperous man.—And his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſaw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to proſper in his hand: and Joſeph found grace in his ſight, and he ſerved him, and he made him overſeer over all his houſe, and all that he had he put into his hand.</hi> This was Gods firſt ſtep to bring <hi>Joſeph</hi> into a great capacity, that he might be able to protect his people.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I will inſtance but in one luſt more, that is, the <hi>malice, hatred, and cruelty of wicked men,</hi> Pſal. 76.10. <hi>Surely the wrah of man ſhall praiſe thee.</hi> Now this ſeems a ſtrange thing, but there is nothing more ordinary than this. The malice and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> contributed much to the Children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> had they not been ſo cruelly dealt with, they would never have been ſo willing to have removed: it is no better than madneſs, not to be juſtified by Religion, nor yet by Reaſon, for private perſons to riſe up in arms againſt their rulers: but <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Oppreſſian makes wiſe men mad,</hi> and God ſometimes makes uſe of the madneſs, both of his Enemies, and of his own People, to bring about his own deſigns. Far be it from me, either to incourage, or to juſtifie ſuch actions; my buſineſs is only to ſhew you how far God makes uſe of mens luſts. But the moſt ordinary and regular way, which God maketh uſe of in this caſe, is by making the ſoberer part of the Princes and Rulers of a Nation, ſenſible of the greatneſs of their peoples ſufferings, and the unreaſonableneſs of the rage and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their adverſaries; and giving them bowels of compaſſion to their brethren, though it may be they be not of their minds. I remember I have ſomewhere read it in one of the <hi>French</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, that a great Peer of that Nation (though a Papiſt) in the midſt of that woful havock, the fury of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:192227:158"/>were making, ſtood up in Counſel, and ſaid, <hi>He had no patience to ſee French-men ſo uſed.</hi> And this is very ordinary, the men of the world are not all of a complexion: ſome of them are men of Honour and Vertue, men of Juſtice, <hi>Charity and Mercy,</hi> perſons <hi>almoſt perſwaded to be Chriſtians,</hi> not far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; in ſhort, men of moral vertue, abhorring <hi>ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>cruelty:</hi> others of them are men of <hi>blood,</hi> and <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> and <hi>cruelty.</hi> Theſe latter are they that make the great havock in the Church of God, breathing out (like <hi>Saul, Act.</hi> 9.) threatnings and ſlaughters againſt the Diſciples of the Lord; and commonly like <hi>Saul,</hi> they have <hi>letters from the high-prieſts, to Damaſcus, to the ſynagogues.</hi> It is much, but it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the very beginning of ſtory—that the greateſt cruelty and rage which the People of God, that have deſired to walk more ſtrictly and holily with him have met with, hath been from the <hi>corrupt Prieſts and Miniſtry.</hi> It was thus upon the firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral corruption of the Prieſthood in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> that was you know upon the revolt of the ten Tribes in <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> time: for though before that there were perſonal corruptions, as that of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> yet (generally) they kept to the Law of God; but in <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> time, the body of the Prieſts was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; for the Scripture ſaid, That <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made of the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt people prieſts of the high places, whoſoever would, he conſecrated him, and he became one of the prieſts of the high places,</hi> 1 King. 13.33. It was not to be thought that ſo great a body of that people ſhould all be corrupted, many there were that kept cloſe to the inſtituted worſhip of God at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and would go thither: though abundance of the people, as <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith, <hi>Willingly walked after the Commandment,</hi> Hoſ. 5.11. The Commandment of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> the <hi>ſon of Nebat,</hi> the Commandment of which you read, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.28, 29, &amp;c. yet many would not. Now as to theſe, the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> tells us, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.1. The Prieſts were <hi>a ſnare on Mizpah, and a net ſpread upon Tabor, and the revolters were profound to make ſlaughter.</hi> So it was in our Saviours time, the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> were the cruel Enemies of Chriſt, and his Diſciples, as you read in the Goſpels, and the ſtory of the Acts of the Apoſtles. And ſo it always hath been, and ſtill is in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites</hi> are the bloody men, the cruel men againſt thoſe that cannot
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:192227:159"/>comply with them. But now there are a great many others, that are perſons of better nature and temper, that hate ſenſuality, and cruelty, and injuſtice, and oppreſſion. Now God often makes uſe of the immoralities of the Enemies of the People of God, to bring about his deſigns for their liberty and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: men of honour and vertue, abhor the ſenſuality and beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the great Enemies of the Church; and although them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (poſſibly) be not of the minds of the People of God, yet they abhor injuſtice, and oppreſſion, and cruelty, and ſenſuality; and this makes them favour the poor ſervants of God, as men that have done nothing worthy of ſuch deaths, or bonds, or to be ſo unreaſonably dealt with: and thus God maketh the wrath and rage of bloody men to praiſe him.</p>
                  <p>I might go on, and ſhew you how God makes uſe of the wars and fightings, the envy, emulation and ſtrife, which often ariſe amongſt the men of the world, (and <hi>James</hi> 3.1. <hi>Whence come all theſe, but from the luſts that war in our members?</hi>) to gain his people liberty and protection. But I have ſpoken enough to juſtifie this Obſervation: but it may be ſome will ſay to me, Why doth God do this? Could not God do his work by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtruments? And were it not more ſuitable to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God, to bring about his deſigns by better inſtruments? To which the anſwer were good enough to ſay, <hi>Who art thou that diſputeſt with God?</hi> It is enough for us, that thus it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, and that this is conſiſtent enough, both with his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Wiſdom. It is not inconſiſtent with his <hi>holineſs, to mean, and to turn that for good,</hi> which men mean, and intend for evil, (as in <hi>Joſeph's</hi> caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20.) for God doth not put this malice into their hearts, he only <hi>ſuffereth them to walk in their own ways,</hi> and then <hi>governeth</hi> their luſts to his own praiſe and glory. But I ſhall ſhew you, that this is a very reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motion and working of Divine Providence, which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you by the following Conſiderations:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That God by this ſheweth his infinite wiſdom and power,</hi> by how much there is the leſs aptitude and diſpoſition in a cauſe, to bring forth an effect; by ſo much muſt the power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> be made more glorious. Now there is nothing in nature leſs diſpoſed to the Glory of God, nor that hath ſo much antipathy to the Glory of God, as ſin and luſt. What cannot that God do, that can make mens luſts to praiſe
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:192227:159"/>him? Luſt (of its own nature) oppoſeth God, nothing is ſo contrary to his deſigns; for God to make this now to ſerve his deſigns, and to bring about his Counſels; this muſt glorifie God, as an Almighty God, that can do whatſoever he pleaſeth, and by what means ſoever he pleaſeth; yea, and by this means God maketh his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> admirable. When he taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs, <hi>Come</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) <hi>let us deal wiſely with them:</hi> God makes <hi>Pharaoh's wiſdom</hi> to deſtroy his people, a great means to deliver his people. What an infinitely-wiſe God did he by this declare himſelf? Turning <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> wiſdom into folly, and making it to operate directly contrary to his deliberations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond Conſideration is this, <hi>That it is but reaſonable that God ſhould make ſome uſe of the worſt of men.</hi> The worſt of men are the Lords creatures, he hath made them, he doth much for them, they live upon his hand of Providence; 'tis reaſonable they ſhould do him ſome ſervice: now, intentionally, and deſignedly, a wicked man will do God no ſervice at all; his heart is quite another way, his life is a purſuit of one luſt or other; if God did not get glory on him beſides his intention, he could have no ſervice at all from him. There is no reaſon that leud and wicked men, covetous, ambitious men, bloody and cruel men ſhould live in the world for nothing; and be maintained from Gods basket for nothing, without doing him any ſervice; they will not ſerve God, as reaſonable creatures ſhould do, offering up their bodies as a living acceptable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, which the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1, determines <hi>our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice:</hi> The Apoſtle therefore to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> calls wicked men <hi>unreaſonable.</hi> They ſhall therefore ſerve God, as <hi>brute creatures,</hi> as the beaſts of the field ſerve him; not knowing what they do, as a meer machine, and engine ſerveth us by the force of our hand; nay in a worſe degree quite contrary to their own counſels, intentions, and deſigns. God could have no ſervice from wicked men, if he did not get himſelf a glory from their luſts, as he got himſelf glory upon <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There is ſomething in Gods Counſels to be produced in the world, that is fit for no other hands, than the hands of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and is hard to be effected any way, but from their luſts.</hi> Theſe are the acts of his Punitive Juſtice upon his People. God is compelled by his Juſtice, ſometimes to <hi>kindle a fire in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:192227:160"/>Sion,</hi> and to <hi>ſet up a furnace in Hieruſalem,</hi> to melt, and to try his people, in order to the purging out of their droſs, and taking away their tin. Now as it is luſt which kindleth all fires, ſo (ordinarily) it is the luſt of Gods Enemies, of wicked men, which bloweth up this fire. Sometimes indeed <hi>Ephraim</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Mamaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim;</hi> but (ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) it is the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or <hi>Egyptian,</hi> or <hi>Babylonian,</hi> that muſt deſtroy <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Men do not uſe to ſet ſheep to hunt, and tear ſheep; but to make uſe of dogs for that work.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This is a reaſonable motion of Providence, <hi>to incourage the people of God, never to deſpair, but continually to hope in the Lords mercy.</hi> That which uſually diſcourageth our hope in God, for any good as to his Church, is the heighth of the rage of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the ſad and forlorn ſtate of things, the appearance of never an inſtrument like to do any ſervice for God, or for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But none of all this is a ſufficient ground for diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if God can make uſe of the worſt of men, and make the luſts of people ſerviceable to his own wiſe counſels, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about his purpoſes. I might alſo have added, that theſe motions of Providence are reaſonable to ſhew wicked men their folly, and how vainly they ſet themſelves againſt the counſels and purpoſes of God; who ordinarily taketh them by guile, and overthroweth them in their own craftineſs. But I have enlarged enough upon the doctrinal part of this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I now come to the Application of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. In the firſt place let us here <hi>admire the infinite power,</hi> and the <hi>wiſdom of God, and learn at all times to truſt in his word.</hi> What cannot that God do? What will not the wiſdom of that God extend to, who can make the higheſt and proudeſt Enemies, which his glory hath, to ſerve the deſigns and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of his glory? The work of <hi>Creation,</hi> is not ſo much a work of infinite power and wiſdom, as this work of Providence. In <hi>Creation,</hi> God only produceth being out of not being: here God brings out his glory from that which hath an unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable contrariety to his glory: nothing is ſo deſperately op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the glory of God, as the ſordid luſts of mans heart: no creature is ſo oppoſite to the honour and glory of God, as a reſolved malitious ſinner is. Now for God to make ſuch a wretch to ſerve him, nay, to make ſuch a wretch in the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:192227:160"/>purſuit of his luſts to ſerve him; and by the ſatisfaction of his luſts, to ſerve the great deſign of his glory: O what an Almighty Power, what an infinite wiſdom muſt this ſpeak in God!</p>
                  <p>And this I ſay ſhould recommend God to us, as a God that may at any time, under any face of things, be truſted. We cannot ſee a worſer face of things, than when wickedneſs is at the heighth, men in the heighth of rage and malice againſt the People of God: when all kind of filthineſs and ſenſuality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in a place; when the <hi>vileſt men are exalted, and the wicked walk on every ſide:</hi> they are put together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.8. But under ſuch diſpenſations, Chriſtians, trouble not your ſelves as to Gods care of his Church: indeed it is, and ought to be an afflicting diſpenſation. 1. <hi>For the glory of God.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a face of things, the holy Name of God is blaſphemed, the honour of God is at preſent laid in the duſt. 2. <hi>Such a time muſt needs be a time of great ſuffering to the holy and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſervants of God.</hi> Many particular ſervants of God, muſt be made great ſufferers under ſuch a Providence: But yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage your ſelf in God; he that can bring light out of darkneſs, can, and will bring good out of ſuch an evil as this is. The Providence of God doth ordinarily compel even the worſt of men to do his work; <hi>howbeit that they mean not ſo:</hi> one way or other they ſhall do the Lords work; if no other way, yet by making their own folly manifeſt to all men: God often brings wicked men upon the ſtage, to make them more abominable. There are many in the world, men of ſobriety and vertue, would not have believed there had been ſuch horrible injuſtice, and oppreſſion, ſuch horrible, and inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble avarice, ſuch mercileſs cruelty in the hearts of many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if they did not ſee them play their parts upon a ſtage in the world. In the mean time know that you truſt in a God, that knoweth how to make uſe of mens malice, and to make the maddeſt and deſperateſt ſinner ſerve his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. In the ſecond place, what a foundation doth this notion lay, for an Exhortation to all, <hi>to break off their ſins by true repentance, and to give unto God a voluntary choſen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:192227:161"/>1. <hi>To break off their ſins by a true repentance.</hi> I remember our Lords words to <hi>Saul,</hi> out of Heaven, <hi>Saul, Saul,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>why perſecuteſt thou me? it is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks.</hi> Suppoſe a perſon, whoſe heart the Devil hath filled with all malice, that if he could, he would pluck God out of Heaven, and root out the Name of God from the Earth: yet methinks this ſhould diſcourage him in his fulleſt career and madneſs; to think, that he that ſitteth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, laugheth him to ſcorn; and when he hath done all he can, he ſhall but have effected the Lords counſels, and done the Lords work, although he meant not ſo. Let therefore the ſinners of the Earth be inſtructed, and learn wiſdom: they cannot do what they liſt, and many times, wherein they think, and talk proudly, God ſheweth himſelf above them, and they do Gods work quite beſides, and contrary to their own intentions. There is no encountring with a God, who can make the wrath of man to praiſe him, and reſtrain the remainder of it when he pleaſeth. 2. <hi>If this be ſo, certainly it is wiſdom in men, deſignedly and intentionally to ſerve God:</hi> otherwiſe they loſe their reward, at leaſt their ſpiritual and eternal reward. We find God with temporal rewards, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rewarding men, that do ſome things at his command, though their hearts in the action be not right with God: ſo <hi>Jehu</hi> was rewarded, his Sons inherited the Throne to the 4th generation; but God at laſt viſited the blood of <hi>Jezreel upon the houſe of Jehu.</hi> But no man hath a ſpiritual reward, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy. and peace of conſcience; nor ſhall have an eternal reward, but that man, who with purpoſe of heart ſerveth the Lord.</p>

                  <p>I Proceed yet in making ſome Obſervations concerning the motions of Providence, in the preſervation and government of the world. An eighth Obſervation, which I ſhall make, and a little enlarge upon, is this:</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 8. <hi>That the Providence of God is wonderfully ſeen in bringing to light hidden counſels of darkneſs, and puniſhing of ſins, which tend to the diſturbance of civil ſocieties.</hi> Indeed there are not many ſins but have an ill influence upon humane ſociety; and the reaſon is, becauſe there is no law in the world ſo fitted to the proſperous beings of Societies, as the law of the Lord is: but yet there are ſome which tend to a more eminent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance and confuſion in them. Such are now plottings and treaſons againſt Princes, whom God hath made the heads of theſe Societies; <hi>Seditions,</hi> and raiſing up <hi>mutinies, murthers,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe make great gaps and diſorders in political bodies, and you ſhall obſerve the Providence of God bearing an eminent teſtimony againſt them, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Curſe not the King, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not in thy thought, and curſe not the rich in thy bed-chamber; for a bird of the air ſhall carry the voice, and that which hath wings ſhall tell the matter:</hi> it ſhall be diſcovered, it ſhall be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly diſcovered, and by ways, that one would never think of. Two things you ſhall obſerve in the workings of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as to this thing.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:192227:162"/>1. <hi>That it is very rarely, that the Providence of God ſuffereth any ſuch deſigns to come to any effect and iſſue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That if at any time he doth for the puniſhment of flagitious rulers ſuffer them to come to iſſue, he very rarely ſuffereth the actors in them to go down to their graves in peace.</hi> This abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly juſtifieth it ſelf in the ſtory of Scripture, and in all other ſtory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Tis very rarely, that the Providence of God ſuffereth conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies to take effect.</hi> Of an hundred plots, that you read of in ſtory, to take away the lives of Princes, and make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances in political affairs, it is very rare to read of any that take effect, <hi>Job</hi> 5.12. either the Lord makes their own hearts to fail them, or weakneth their hands, that they cannot find their enterprize; or put's it into the hearts of ſome of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators to reveal the matter, or cauſeth ſome ſtrange impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and jealouſies in thoſe whoſe lives are aimed at: ſome way or other the Providence of God worketh, to cruſh the cockatrices egg, before it hatcheth into a ſerpent. Our Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was a famous inſtance of the ſpecial Providence of God in this kind, over ſuch, as God maketh rulers over others. What a ſtrange diſcovery had we of the Powder-treaſon in this Nation? But this is but the firſt thing which I commended to you under this Obſervation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes the Providence of God, for his wiſe ends, doth ſuffer ſuch conſpiracies to come to iſſue; <hi>either for the perſonal ſins of ſuch rulers, or for the ſins of the people, over whom God hath ſet them;</hi> but when he doth, <hi>he rarely ſuffereth the actors in them to go down to their graves in peace.</hi> You read 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. that <hi>Baanah</hi> and <hi>Recab,</hi> two ſervants of <hi>Iſhboſeth,</hi> conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and ſlew him, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>David</hi> cauſeth them <hi>both to be ſlain. Baaſha,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.27, conſpireth againſt <hi>Nadab,</hi> and ſlayeth him; (indeed the Scripture doth not expreſs the particular kind of his death) but he threatned him by <hi>Jehu</hi> the Prophet, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.3, 4. and tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>That the wrath of the Lord came againſt him for all the evil that he did—in being like to the houſe of Jeroboam, and becauſe he killed him,</hi> that is, he killed <hi>Nadab,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And againſt <hi>Elah</hi> his Son, <hi>Zimri</hi> killed him, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Had Zimri peace that ſlew his maſter?</hi> no, he killed himſelf; when he had reigned but ſeven days, <hi>ver.</hi> 28, after him <hi>Ahab</hi> (a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:192227:162"/>moſt wicked man) dyed in war, his Son <hi>Jehoram</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Jehu,</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> executed both the Lord's counſel and command in what he did; ſo the Lord ſpared him, and three or four af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him of his generation, to fulfil his promiſe to <hi>Jehu.</hi> After this, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15, <hi>Shallum</hi> conſpireth againſt <hi>Zechariah,</hi> and ſlayeth him, but reigns only one month; and <hi>Menahem</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his bloodſhed, and ſlayeth him: <hi>Joaſh</hi> was ſlain for the blood of the Sons of <hi>Jehojada,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 24.23. <hi>Amaziah</hi> his Son ſucceedeth him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.1. &amp; <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>He ſlayeth his ſervants that had ſlain the King his father.</hi> And as this notion is juſtified everywhere in ſacred ſtory, ſo civil ſtory alſo maketh it good: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that breaketh an hedg, a ſerpent ſhall bite him:</hi> Government is the hedg of a Nation, and rulers are the ſtakes in that hedg, that keep it together; and it is very rare, but the Providence of God ordereth it ſo, that a ſerpent biteth him, who breaketh this hedg, which the Providence of God hath ſet up about a Nation, or People. Princes and Rulers, are (in a great meaſure) priviledged perſons, and have great prerogatives from Divine Providence. And this motion of Divine Providence ſeemeth very reaſonable. 1. <hi>If we conſider the relation that they have unto God.</hi> 2. <hi>Or their uſefulneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men.</hi> I ſay, firſt, if we conſider their <hi>relation unto God,</hi> which I ſhall open to you in three things: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: They are the <hi>Ordinance of God.</hi> 2: They are <hi>Gods Creatures.</hi> 3. They are <hi>Gods Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Rulers are Gods Ordinance.</hi> This is the reaſon which the Apoſtle giveth Chriſtians, for ſubjection to governours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God: whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God.</hi> God is a God of order, and not of confuſion, as well in States, as in Churches: and for the conſervation of this order, he hath been pleaſed to ordain <hi>Government,</hi> a ſubordination and ſubjection of ſome unto others: and a man cannot riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, but he muſt riſe up in oppoſition to a Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, Rulers are called <hi>the Ordinance of man,</hi> or as it is in the Greek, <hi>an humane creature:</hi> but that muſt not be underſtood of <hi>Government</hi> in it ſelf, (that is the <hi>Ordinance of God).</hi> I am aware that that is a Text, that is much made uſe of to prove Chriſtians duty of Obedience to humane Laws and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:192227:163"/>Sanctions. But this ſeemeth not to be the ſenſe: For, 1. <hi>We cannot ſubmit thus to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake.</hi> Men may command us things which are contrary to the Will and Command of God, and in ſuch caſes our Allegiance is firſt due unto the great God. 2. Again, <hi>The diſtribution that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, ſeemeth not to favour this ſenſe—whether to the King as ſupreme, or unto rulers ſent by him.</hi> Let the form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under which you live, be what it will, let the perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the execution of this Government, be what they will, their qualities are not ſo much to be regarded, as the office which they bear. 3. Thus both the <hi>Syriack</hi> verſion, and ſome of the antients interpret it: the <hi>Syriack</hi> verſion interprets it—<hi>Be you ſubject to all the Sons of men.</hi> 4. But laſtly, The word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is there uſed, is always applied to perſons, not to ſuch conſtitutions, as laws are. Beſides, there are that think, that the Apoſtle uſeth a dialect, then in uſe: there is nothing more ordinary in Latin Authors, than thoſe phraſes of <hi>creare conſulem, creare dictatorem,</hi> &amp;c. it is a phraſe a little in uſe amongſt us, to expreſs the conferring of ſome particular ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. But I digreſs too far, certain it is, that as Government in the abſtract, ſo particular governours in the concrete, are the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> and ſo have a more eminent relation unto God: All men are the creatures of God, they are the works of his hands, rulers are the Ordinance of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Rulers are Gods creatures,</hi> and that not in a large ſenſe, (ſo every thing elſe is) but in a more eminent way; as Rulers in that capacity, to which God hath called them, they are <hi>Gods creatures;</hi> Prov. 8.15. <hi>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice: by me Princes rule, and nobles, even all the Judges of the earth.</hi> It muſt not be underſtood only <hi>by my ſufferance and permiſſion, nor by me in an ordinary courſe of Providence,</hi> as all things are by God; but by me in a way of <hi>ſpecial Providence</hi> and deſignation: for (as the Pſalmiſt ſaith), <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.6, 7. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion cometh not from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth: but God is the judg, he pulleth down one, and he ſetteth up another.</hi> And this muſt be ſaid of the worſt of Rulers: they came not up into that place of government, without the Lord. <hi>Saul</hi> was a Prince bad enough, God foretold by <hi>Samuel</hi> what he would be; yet you know what a ſpecial hand God had in the ſetting of him up. And God ſetteth up good or bad Rulers
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:192227:163"/>over a people, according to his deſigns to bleſs and proſper, or to chaſtiſe and puniſh them. Rulers, as rulers, be they good or bad, gentile, or froward, are God's creatures in an eminent way. Now as a Prince thinks himſelf obliged in honour to maintain his creatures, whom he hath ſet up in any place, for any end; ſo God will maintain Princes, as they are his creatures, raiſed up for his ſpecial deſigns.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay further yet, <hi>Rulers are Gods vicegerents,</hi> Pſal. 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid you are Gods;</hi> and in this ſenſe it is true which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There are Gods many, and Lords many.</hi> Every Prince is but a Vice-roy to the King of Kings, a <hi>Deputy-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant</hi> to the great Lord of Heaven and Earth. This createth a very near relation betwixt God and them, and highly engageth the Providente of God for them. Every Prince taketh a ſpecial care of perſons, which he ſendeth abroad for <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> and which repreſent his perſon and authority. Plots and conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies againſt Princes, are much againſt God himſelf. God giveth this reaſon for his ſevere Law againſt murther, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed: for in the image of God made he man.</hi> The Image of God in man, lay much in his <hi>Knowledg, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, dominion over other creatures.</hi> If God ſendeth a people, a Prince, in whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Image of God can be ſeen in the three former things, <hi>Knowledg,</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> yet he hath given unto all Rulers <hi>a dominion over his creatures,</hi> and that not only over brute and inanimate creatures, (every man hath ſuch a dominion, and is a great Prince) but over rational creatures: and herein much of the Image of God, who is the <hi>King of kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of lords, and ruler of Princes,</hi> is to be ſeen. Now I ſay conſidering this great relation of Rulers to God, it is but reaſonable that God ſhould watch over them with a ſpecial eye of Providence, maintaining his own Ordinance, his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, his own Vicegerents in the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 But ſecondly, The reaſonableneſs of it will appear, if you conſider the <hi>uſefulneſs of Rulers unto men.</hi> Upon the former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have ſhewed you how God conſulteth his own glory. I ſhall now ſhew you how God in theſe motions of Providence conſulteth our good. It is uſually ſaid, and I think very truly, <hi>Better Tyranny than Anarchy;</hi> better a very ill oppreſſive go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, then no government: He that would pluck up the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:192227:164"/>government of any place, would but pluck up the bridg, which in a ſhort time, himſelf will have occaſion to go over: ſo that God in his ſpecial Providence towards, and for Rulers, ſheweth a ſpecial kindneſs to humane ſociety. What do laws ſignifie without Executors of them? Now this is the office of Rulers, to execute the Laws, and if ſome of them be partial in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, and ſpare ſome tranſgreſſors; yet there's none of them, but in many things do execute juſtice, and keep up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the face of order of humane ſociety. But I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto only inſtanced in one ſort of ſins, eminently diſturbing humane ſocieties, <hi>treaſons, ſeditions, conſpiracies,</hi> &amp;c. I come now to a ſecond.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Oppreſſion is another ſin of this nature,</hi> and this muſt be the ſin of Superiors, and men that are in power over others. I may joyn with it <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> they are of a great cognation one to another: Oppreſſion is one of the crying ſins of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Providence of God is eminently ſeen in giving teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt it: this was that ſin for which God ſo plagued <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 3.7. <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poor, for the ſighing of the needy, now will I ariſe</hi> (ſaith the Lord), and the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God is ſo certain againſt oppreſſors, that the wiſe man calleth to us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Envy thou not the oppreſſor, and chuſe none of his ways.</hi> Doth he flouriſh? doth he grow rich and great? <hi>Envy him not, chuſe none of his ways.</hi> It is very ſeldom that God letteth eminent oppreſſors eſcape. If they be amongſt <hi>inferiour Rulers,</hi> God ſtirreth up their <hi>ſuperiours</hi> againſt them at one time or other: If chief rulers be <hi>oppreſſors,</hi> God hath other ways to puniſh them, either immediately by his own hand, as he did <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> or ſuffering people to throw off the reins of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which was the caſe of <hi>Abijam,</hi> though he did but threaten <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> 1 King. 12.11. All men are not wiſe, the moſt of people are over-ruled by their own luſts and paſſions, and not governed by reaſon: but even for wiſe men <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.7. <hi>That oppreſſion will make them mad,</hi> put them out of the government of their reaſon. It is indeed madneſs, and nothing but madneſs for private perſons to riſe up againſt a government; but we ſee it ſometimes done, and uſually op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, eminent, and general oppreſſion gives the occaſion, and is the proximate cauſe of it; but one way or other God (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily) revengeth <hi>oppreſſion</hi> by ſignal Providences; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:192227:164"/>the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>If thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poor, and the violent perverting of judgment and juſtice in a people, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the higheſt regardeth, and there is higher than they.</hi> Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſpecial and remarkable Providence of God in this caſe, may be conceived to be, 1. <hi>Gods great love to Juſtice and Judgment.</hi> 2. <hi>His great kindneſs to Political Societies.</hi> God is a juſt and righteous God, and loveth juſtice: Juſtice is an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Attribute of God, he could not be God, if he could be unjuſt: he giveth to every one their due, and he cannot but give every one their due; and the righteous God loveth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and hateth iniquity. Now oppreſſion is nothing elſe but a violent perverting of Juſtice and Judgment, by him that hath power on his ſide. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.31. <hi>He that oppreſſeth the poor, reproacheth his maker:</hi> he reproacheth his Maker, becauſe it is God that hath made his <hi>brother poor,</hi> and put him under his feet. Again, he reproacheth his Maker, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hateth and abhorreth all oppreſſion and injuſtice;</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to rule in the place of God, but he reproacheth his Maker: God dealeth ſo by none, his law directeth the quite contrary. Again, he reproacheth his Maker, becauſe <hi>God hath taken the poor, the ſtranger, the fatherleſs, and the widow into his ſpecial protection;</hi> and hath given many particular laws about them, and given the world a particular charge concerning them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As God is a God of Juſtice, and loveth that; ſo he hath alſo a great kindneſs for humane ſocieties, and for brotherly love.</hi> God hath in Creation diſpoſed man to ſociety, he is not <hi>like the wild Aſs, that loveth to be alone in the wilderneſs;</hi> he hath alſo diſpoſed them to trades and employments, ſerving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo as though a beaſt, or a bird could live without one another, yet men can live in no degree of felicity (outward feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city) without company; nor can ſociety be well maintained without <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>brotherly love;</hi> injuſtice, violence, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion break all humane ſociety. There is nothing that breaks humane ſociety, more than oppreſſion doth; when the greater devour the leſſer, and the richer ſwallow up thoſe that are more poor, that they might be left alone in the Earth. There's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more oppoſite to brotherly love, the ligament of humane ſociety, than oppreſſion is; and therefore the ſpecial Providence
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:192227:165"/>of God in the puniſhment of it, and delivering the oppreſſed from the bondage of it, is not to be judged a ſtrange thing, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding conſonant to the nature of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third ſin which makes gaps in humane ſocieties, is <hi>murder,</hi> a private, willful taking away the life of another; I ſay <hi>private,</hi> for if it be done by the hand of Juſtice, it is no <hi>murther:</hi> I add <hi>wilful</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>caſual homicide,</hi> when one is the cauſe of the death of another, not in the leaſt intending him death, or any harm tendent to it. It was one of Gods Precepts to <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 9.6. <hi>Whoſo ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed, for in the image of God made he him.</hi> Afterwards it was one of his Ten Commandments, given to his people on <hi>Mount Sinai, Thou ſhalt do no murther.</hi> And although in the caſe of <hi>caſual homicide,</hi> he appointed <hi>Cities of refuge,</hi> to which the manſlayer might fly, and be free from the avenger of blood; yet for the wilful murtherer, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.31. he ſaith—<hi>you ſhall take no ſatisfaction for the life of a murtherer, which is guilty of death; but he ſhall ſurely be put to death:</hi> and verſe 33. <hi>So ſhall you not pollute the land wherein you are: for blood, it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleanſed of the blood that is ſhed therein, but by the blood of him that ſhed it.</hi> And accordingly the Providence of God hath (generally) ordered the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſeveral parts of the world, that unleſs it hath been in a very debauch't nation, ſcarce any place hath been found where the Rulers have not been zealous, even from the light of nature, againſt wilful murtherers; and the Providence of God is in nothing more eminently ſeen, than in the diſcovery of ſuch tranſgreſſion, and bringing them to juſtice. It is a common obſervation, therefore I ſhall need the leſs to inſiſt upon the Juſtification of it. Sometimes God makes uſe of the <hi>fear and paſſion,</hi> and ſhy-looks of the guilty conſcience of the murtherer, to diſcover himſelf: ſometimes the birds of the air ſhall purſue him (as I remember I have ſomewhere read of a famous ſtory of murtherers, purſued by Crows and Ravens), ſometimes a <hi>Dog</hi> ſhall do it; ſometimes a <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhall do it: in ſhort, the ſtories are very many, and ſtrange, of the Providence of God in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of murther: Murthers make great gaps and diſorders in humane ſocieties.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Adultery</hi> is another ſin, which maketh great confuſion in humane ſociety; though not like thoſe beforementioned, but in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:192227:165"/>a more ſecret way; yet great diſorder it begets. By Gods old Law, the <hi>adulterer</hi> was to be put to death; it was an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary act, and one of thoſe we call <hi>heroick acts,</hi> not to be defended, but by an immediate <hi>impetus,</hi> by a command from God, that of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> I mean, taking a javelin, and at once running through <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Coſbi:</hi> God juſtified it, and promiſed <hi>Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has</hi> a <hi>reward</hi> for it. The vengeance of God upon thoſe that have given up themſelves to this ſin, is eminent; he hath prepared a dart to ſtrike through their livers, which he uſeth in no other caſe, a peculiar defiling, tormenting diſeaſe: The perſons that are guilty, are often ſent to hell in the act, by the jealouſie of Husbands; and by the Laws of moſt Nations, ſuch manſlayers are juſtified. It is a ſin indeed, that doth not make that havock in humane ſociety, which ſome of thoſe beforementioned do; and therefore the Providence of God is not ſo remarkably ſeen in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting it, and diſcovering preparations to it; but it is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſeen in the puniſhment of it, both as to puniſhments in this life, and in his threatnings, as to depriving them of a life to come.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I will inſtance in one more, and that is, <hi>Rebellion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the lawful commands of parents.</hi> It is the fifth of of the Ten Commandments, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> Upon which account the Apoſtle calleth it, <hi>the firſt commandment with promiſe.</hi> Indeed this ſin is the root of moſt diſorder that is in political ſociety. The rebellious child ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom proveth a dutiful wife, or good husband, nor good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, nor good ſubject, unleſs grace firſt maketh a change in their hearts, and bringeth them from under the government of their paſſions; the Providence of God is therefore eminently to be ſeen in the puniſhment of ſuch children. By the Law of God, <hi>the Son that obeyed not his father, was to be ſtoned to death.</hi> Read <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.18, 19, 20. <hi>He that curſeth his father or mother, ſhall dye the death,</hi> Exod. 21.17. Levit. 20.9. Mal. 15.4. Mar. 7.20. And if you obſerve the Providence of God, it ſtrangely purſueth rebellious children with vengeance, they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom proſper.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I will inſtance but in one ſin more, <hi>That is perſecution, or eminent diſturbance of others, for their conſcience towards God.</hi> This is a ſin which doth not only diſturb humane ſociety, but
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:192227:166"/>the beſt of humane ſocieties, the ſociety of the Church: it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbeth humane ſociety, ingageth husband againſt wife, and children againſt parents, and brother againſt brother; it ſpoileth that commerce and traffique, by which political ſocieties are maintained and upheld. As to that, it cannot be without a great connexion and twiſting of mens intereſts of divers perſwaſions, one with another; ſo as the interrupting the free courſe of one, is the interruption of another: and while perſons are rifled in their houſes, haled to priſons, there muſt needs be an interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their commerce. But this ſin hath this further aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>That it makes diſturbance in the beſt ſocieties;</hi> the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of Gods People for his worſhip, are the beſt of humane ſocieties, God is in the midſt of them, more preſent with them, than with any ſocieties in the world beſides them. Thoſe that rudely break in upon ſuch Aſſemblies, break in upon the great God of Heaven and Earth, who hath ſaid, <hi>Whereſoever two or three are gathered together in my name, I will be in the midſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them;</hi> and may juſtly expect ſome ſuch extraordinary judgment, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> met with, when they would have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken open <hi>Lots</hi> houſe, to have pull'd the <hi>Angels</hi> out; but God doth not always work miraculouſly, but ſeldom fails (even in this life) to ſet his mark upon this ſort of ſinners. It is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that I have formerly made to you. You ſhall in ſtory read of <hi>perſecutions,</hi> which ſometimes have laſted long, very long, but ſeldom of a <hi>perſecutor</hi> that hath laſted long: he is an odious, abominable wretch, whom vengeance will neither ſuffer to live, nor often to dye after the ordinary death of men. He that will but read over the ſtory of the ten Primitive perſecutions, will ſee this abundantly confirmed: or if any thinks thoſe ſtories too old, let him read what became of <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Bonner,</hi> thoſe two bloody wretches in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, and of divers others that were their inſtruments, and willingly followed their Commandments; and poſſibly he may confirm himſelf in this Obſervation, by later examples than thoſe alſo. But I have inſtanced in thoſe ſins, which do moſt eminently diſturb humane ſocieties, and ſpoken enough to the doctrinal part of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. I ſhall reduce all I ſhall ſay by way of Application to two heads: 1. <hi>Shewing you what advantage this obſervation giveth me, to call upon all men, but eſpecially thoſe in higher orbs, to praiſe the Lord.</hi> 2. <hi>To perſwade all men to take heed, as of all
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:192227:166"/>ſin, ſo eſpecially of ſuch ſins as theſe are, againſt which the wrath of God is ſo eminently revealed.</hi>

In the firſt place, let then all men that live upon the Earth <hi>praiſe the Lord; but eſpecially ſuch as are ſuperiors and rulers over others,</hi> and more eſpecially <hi>ſuch as are his Church.</hi> The Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.1. calls to all, ſaying, <hi>Praiſe the Lord, praiſe ye the name of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20, 21. He calleth in particular, <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O houſe of Iſrael: Bleſs the Lord, O houſe of Aaron: Bleſs the Lord, O houſe of Levi; you that fear the Lord, bleſs the Lord: Bleſſed be the Lord out of Zion, which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth at Hieruſalem.</hi> 1. This obſervation calleth to all <hi>the ſons and daughters of men to bleſs the Lord.</hi> We are all ſociable creatures, and much of the comfort of our lives lyeth in our ſocieties and fellowſhips one with another, either in our family-ſocieties, or in our civil-ſocieties, or in our Church-ſocieties. We ſhould think it a life worſe than death, to be condemned to live <hi>like a wild Aſs alone in the wilderneſs.</hi> Now there are ſome luſts of men, that would ſpoil us of all this comfort. God pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly ſets himſelf againſt them, and makes theſe the marks for his arrows of vengeance. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Centurion, He hath loved our nation, and hath built us a ſynagogue.</hi> We may ſay of our good God, he hath <hi>loved mankind,</hi> for he hath taken care to preſerve order in humane ſocieties, and ſeverely to chaſten the invaders upon the rights of others. What an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement doth this lay upon all men to praiſe the Lord? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſirs, there is a great deal of praiſe, and glory, and homage due to God from all men, as they are concerned in their ſeveral ſocieties. There is a great deal of glory due to God from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, for his teſtimony againſt thoſe luſts of men, (ſuch as are <hi>murtherers</hi> and <hi>adulterers</hi>) which in a ſhort time would ſpoil all the comfort of thoſe ſocieties. Certainly every family is bound to worſhip God, and to walk with God. But parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Let Rulers praiſe the Lord.</hi> Let all the Princes of the Earth give homage to him that ought to be ſerved; they are more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial marks for furious and ambitious mens luſts. Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence (as you have heard) is eminently ſeen in preventing their dangers, in <hi>revenging their harms.</hi>

                     <hi>Surely then</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) <hi>thoſe that rule over men ſhould be juſt, ruling them in the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:192227:167"/>fear of the Lord: their light ſhould be like the light of the morning without clouds.</hi> God hath not only ſet them up as lights upon an hill, but he hath made his ſpecial Providence to be a lanthorn about them; that 'tis rarely, that the wind of ſedition and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon prevails to blow them out, and then 'tis (ordinarily) for ſome eminent Provocation of God. But I am not ſpeaking to perſons in that capacity. You that are parents, <hi>praiſe the Lord:</hi> Gods ſpecial Providence you ſee reacheth you, and in a great meaſure ſecureth you from that great heart-ach of rebellious and diſobedient children. I know you will ſay, How then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this to be the great affliction of many good parents? To which I anſwer: 1. <hi>There is many a good parent may have been but like good old Ely,</hi> too indulgent and cockering to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ordinarily God keepeth up the authority of parents over their children, until themſelves have proſtituted it; and in the rebellion and diſobedience of their children, they may read their own ſin, and ſee as much cauſe to be humbled for that, as any thing elſe, as <hi>David</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Adonijah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.5, 6. And herein the goodneſs of God towards parents will be ſeen, that if he doth not (upon their endeavours) ſecure to them the duty of their children; yet he will not fail to revenge their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Let the poor and weak of the earth praiſe the Lord:</hi> he hath declared himſelf <hi>the father of the fatherleſs, and the judg of the widows, a refuge for the oppreſſed,</hi> Pſal. 68.5. Exod. 22.5. Pſal. 10.11. How are all the widows, and fatherleſs children, all the poor and oppreſſed people of the world bound to praiſe, and to ſerve this God, who hath taken upon himſelf the ſpecial patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and protection of them? This indeed would be the beſt uſe we could poſſibly make of this Obſervation, relating to the ſpecial Providence of God, if it might lay a ſpecial obligation upon all thoſe, who are thus eſpecially concerned, to magnifie God as their great patron and defender. And how can they praiſe God more effectually, than in doing thoſe particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which concern them all in their reſpective relations? or with reference to thoſe peculiar circumſtances of Providence, under which they are acted. I ſhall add but one branch of Application more, and indeed it is not a new Uſe, for it is a part of our praiſe and homage which we owe unto God upon this Reflexion, <hi>viz.</hi>

To all, <hi>to take heed of thoſe ſins, which God in his word declares himſelf more eminently to abhor,</hi> and in the execution of Providence, <hi>doth moſt ſeverely puniſh.</hi> All ſin is in it ſelf a filthy and abominable thing, and the juſt object of every good mans hatred: for ſhould not we hate what God hateth? and what hath of all things the greateſt oppoſition to God? yes, we ought to hate it with a perfect hatred. But ſuch is the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of our heart, that we are not ſo led to an hatred and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of ſin, from the intrinſecal evil, and obliquity of it, as from the dangerous and pernicious conſequence of it. Death, eternal death is the wages of every ſin; but this being only mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith to bold ſinners, (none having ever come from the dead to give them an account of thoſe flames) the puniſhments of ſin in this life, are thoſe things which moſt deter carnal ſenſual men. But if men will look no further, nor believe any more; yet let this lay ſome law upon us, and make us afraid of thoſe ſins which I have inſtanced in, being ſuch, whoſe judgment the Providence of God ſeldom letteth ſleep ſo long, as to another life. Let this mind us not to <hi>meddle with them that are given to change, that curſe Kings and Rulers in their bed-chambers,</hi> and are of turbulent and unquiet ſpirits, always plotting, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving ſeditions, and treaſons, and diſturbances to civil gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: it is very rarely, that God ſuffereth their deſigns to come to iſſue, or their perſons to come to the grave in peace. 2. <hi>What a law ſhould it lay upon the rich and great men of the earth,</hi> to take heed of violent perverting juſtice and judgment, of turning away the cauſes of the widows, and the fatherleſs in judgment: To conſider, that he who is the higheſt, doth conſider the matter; and there is one higher than the higheſt of them, who abuſe their power to trample the poor under foot. If men be not turned <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and have baniſhed all the fear of God from their eyes and hearts; it muſt a little give them law, and lay them under ſome reſtraints, as to thoſe horrible ſins, of <hi>murther, perſecution, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing their neighbours wives,</hi> &amp;c. To conſider that theſe are ſome of the ſins, which go ordinarily before-hand to judgment, and which God uſually revengeth by ſome ſpecial remarkable Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences in this life. But it is time to finiſh this diſcourſe. Let us beg Gods bleſſing upon it.</p>

                  <p>I Am in a diſcourſe about the obſervable things of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. When do you think, ſhall I have finiſhed it? <hi>Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, night unto night declareth knowledg.</hi> When I have ſaid all that I can, I muſt conclude with <hi>Job, Lo theſe are parts of his ways, but how little a portion of him do we underſtand?</hi> However, it is wonderfully ſweet to know the leaſt of God. If a learned man could think it worth his while to write a book of the <hi>admiranda Nili,</hi> the admirable and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable things of the famous River of <hi>Nile;</hi> What a book might be written, and how much worth a pen-mans hand would it be, to write a book, and call it, <hi>Admiranda,</hi> or <hi>Obſervanda Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiae Divinae,</hi> the admirable and obſervable things of Divine Providence? But leaving Prefaces, I proceed to a ninth Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is this:</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 9. <hi>The Providence of God often repayeth both good and evil, and eſpecially charity and cruelty in this life in its own kind,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.8. 2 Cor. 5.10. That God will reward every man <hi>according to his works,</hi> is moſt certain, and is a piece of Divine Juſtice; he cannot condemn the innocent, nor clear the guilty, there will be a <hi>now</hi> when God will viſit for all ſin: and though ſinners do evil an hundred years, yet the day of vengeance will come. And to let us know the certainty of it, oftentimes the Prophets of God in the denouncing of judgments yet a far off, cryed out, <hi>It is come, It is come;</hi> and gave the alarum, as if the enemy had already entred the gates. But God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence all ſinners in this life: Judgment comes afterward.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:192227:168"/>But for thoſe whom God doth chaſtiſe in this life, he doth not puniſh them all the ſame way; ſome are puniſhed with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral judgments, and thoſe ſome of them of one ſort, ſome of another: others he puniſheth with ſpiritual judgments, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, hardneſs of heart. And it is the ſame caſe for rewards of grace, ſome have little reward for all their ſervice for God, until they come in Heaven; others are rewarded in this life, but in different manners. The Obſervation which I am making, concerneth <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> and the vices oppoſite to it, ſuch as are, cruelty, hardheartedneſs to thoſe in want and miſery. In theſe caſes I obſerve Gods Providence often retaliates. I ſay, 1. The Providence of God doth often recompence other ſins in this manner, but eſpecially ſins againſt <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love.</hi> God many times repayeth other ſins in their kind: our Saviour by this argument diſſuades from raſh cenſuring, and cenſorious judging of others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>For with what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you judg, you ſhall be judged: and with what meaſure you mete, it ſhall be meted to you again.</hi> (A text which if well thought upon, ſhould deter Chriſtians from the too common practice of cenſuring and judging one another) eſpecially in doubtful things, where they are not of a mind; as if ſincerity and uprightneſs were the Prerogative of a party in Religion, or annexed to ſome particular forms. You know God threatned <hi>David</hi> for his adultery with <hi>Bathſheba, That he would take his wives before his eyes, and give them to his neighbour, and he ſhould lye with his wives in the ſight of the Sun,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.11. and it was fulfilled by the permiſſion (though not by the inſtigation) of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.22. Spoiling and plundering of others, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away their goods without a juſt warrant from God, is another ſin we find thus threatned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.1. <hi>Wo to thee that ſpoileſt, and thou wert not ſpoiled; thoſe that thou ſo rifledſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did thee any wrong; and dealeſt treacherouſly, and they dealt not treacherouſly with thee: when thou ſhalt ceaſe to ſpoil, thou ſhalt be ſpoiled, and when thou ſhalt make an end to deal treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, they ſhall deal treacherouſly with thee.</hi> But that indeed referreth to the more ſpecial obſervation, as to ſins oppoſite to that Charity we ſhould exerciſe to our brethren, to which I now come. I ſay it is very obſervable, that God puniſheth <hi>ſins againſt charity,</hi> and rewardeth deeds, and <hi>acts of charity</hi> in their kind, <hi>ſecundum legem Talionis,</hi> ordinarily giving the Authors of both
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:192227:169"/>like for like. I will firſt ſhew it you in the motions of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as to the execution of <hi>Vindicative Juſtice,</hi> in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſins againſt Charity. Againſt which men may ſin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>omiſſions,</hi> hardening their hearts from their brother in diſtreſs, not relieving him when it is in their power, according to their ability; or by <hi>commiſſions: murders, oppreſſions, cruelty,</hi> are all ſins againſt <hi>Charity.</hi> 1. For <hi>omiſſions.</hi> It is a dreadful text, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.13. <hi>He that ſtoppeth his ear againſt the cry of the poor, he alſo ſhall cry himſelf, and ſhall not be heard.</hi> A text worth deliberating upon by thoſe who find their hearts ſo ſhut up in cafes of Charity: not that we are bound to hear the cry of all that are poor. There are ſome poor, that the greateſt act of Charity we can ſhew them, is not to relieve them, that they may learn not to be idle, and wander up and down begging, refuſing to work. The poor we are concerned in, are Gods poor; I hope we favour none that are lazy, idle, or leud, and by that means bring themſelves to, and continue themſelves at a morſel of bread: far be it from me, or any Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, to plead for ſuch. You from us hear the cries of the Lords poor, take heed of <hi>ſtopping your ears at their cry,</hi> remember <hi>Solomons</hi> word, Gods word by <hi>Solomon: He that doth ſo, he alſo ſhall cry, and not be heard:</hi> you may alſo come into ſuch a condition, or you may have a child may come to it through age, through Gods hand upon him. You remember the ſtory of <hi>Naomi,</hi> ſhe went out <hi>full,</hi> ſhe returned <hi>empty;</hi> the ſtory of <hi>Job,</hi> and others in Scripture. I could tell you the ſtories of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers perſons of far greater eſtates (ſome of them), than any that hear me this day, yet brought to live upon the baskets of others: who knows what you or yours may come to? Do you think the great fire at <hi>London</hi> 1666, that at <hi>Northampton</hi> but the laſt year; That at a Town in this County two or three years ago, at <hi>Cottenham</hi> in <hi>Cambridg-ſhire</hi> the other day, hath not given many inſtances of this nature? (for God of late hath very remarkably contended with <hi>England,</hi> as by ſuch a plague, as our forefathers never knew; ſo by a multitude of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fires, for number and greatneſs not to be parallel'd). God make us to underſtand his Rod, and how many ways <hi>he is as a moth unto England,</hi> ſecretly, and gradually, and almoſt irreparably devouring and deſtroying us. This maketh our days full of the cry of the poor: God grant we be not alſo full
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:192227:169"/>of ſuch as ſtop their ears at the cry of the poor, either giving nothing, or in no proportion to relieve them. I wiſh we could conſider and remember that Text, and think what may be our portion, and do as we would be done by, and remember, God often puniſheth this uncharitableneſs in its kind. Men of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearts in proſperity, (ordinarily) meet with hard-hearts in their adverſity; with what meaſure they mete to others, it is meted unto them again. The Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>perſwadeth the reſtoring of a brother fallen in the ſpirit of meekneſs,</hi> and uſeth this Topick, <hi>Conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> And to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> he ſpeakes, <hi>To remember them that are bound, as bound with them: and them which ſuffer adverſity, as being your ſelves in the body,</hi> Heb. 13.2. There's much in thoſe words, <hi>Leſt thou alſo be tempted,</hi> and thoſe, <hi>as being your ſelves in the body.</hi> In caſes of true charity, Chriſtians, as they ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other things, ſo they ſhould conſider, <hi>that they themſelves are in the body;</hi> they may loſe their eſtates, their <hi>health,</hi> their <hi>limbs;</hi> they are not in Heaven yet, they <hi>are in the world,</hi> and they are in the body; they are not meerly ſpirits invulnerable, <hi>impenetrable:</hi> Men ſhould think my houſe may be fired, and all I have loſt in an hour or two: I may loſe my eyes, my limbs, as this poor creature hath, <hi>I am</hi> in the <hi>body.</hi> So in thoſe words there's a great Emphaſis, <hi>Leſt thou alſo be tempted:</hi> Tempted, ſometimes ſignifies as much as afflicted, (though indeed in that Text it ſeems to ſignifie <hi>ſollicited to ſin, and overcome).</hi> God (ſaith the Apoſtle) for thy rigid dealing with thy brother, over-born with a temptation to ſin, may ſuffer the Devil to give thee a <hi>foil;</hi> would'ſt thou in ſuch a caſe be roughly dealt with thy ſelf? With what meaſure men mete to others, God meaſureth to them again. Let me ſay to you, take heed of omitting your duty in a charitable act, leſt thou alſo comeſt to be ſo afflicted, as to need others charity; and when thou art ſo, God ſhould repay thee in thy own kind, ſo ſtraiten mens hearts towards thee, that from perſons, from whom thou mighteſt have expected pounds, thou haſt not ſo many pence: think with thy ſelf how ſuch a thing would pleaſe you? Let me here give you two rules, which I think your Reaſons will all concur with.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a fooliſh thing for any perſon (in circumſtances of mortality) ſo to govern himſelf in his converſation, as if he were not ſubject to the common accidents of that ſtate.</hi> The Apoſtle
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:192227:170"/>ſaith of <hi>Elijah, That he was a man ſubject to like paſſions with other men:</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of humane weakneſſes, ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; and God conſidereth that, and gives us allowances for it: and therefore though <hi>Job</hi> had many ill fits of impatience, when the hand of God was heavy upon him; yet God ſaith, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the patience of Job.</hi> We are all of us alſo ſubject to the ſame ſufferings, and the Apoſtle from this Topick, comforteth his <hi>Corinthians</hi> in thoſe firſt (and furious) times of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but what is common to men.</hi> Now I ſay there is nothing more fooliſh, than for any of us in our converſation to govern our ſelves, as if we were not ſo, but out of the gun ſhot of the chaſtiſing Providence of God. Our bodies are ſubject to death, to ſickneſſes, to old age, and impotencies; our eſtates are expoſed to the fire, to the thief, to the mercileſs ſoldier, to the oppreſſor. Now for a man in his converſation to govern himſelf ſo, as if he were never to dye; as if he were never to be ſick; as if it were not poſſible that a fire ſhould devour his pleaſant things, that he or his ſhould not be brought to ſtraits, is no better than folly and madneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It is as fooliſh a thing for a man to promiſe himſelf, that in caſe of ſuch accidents, others ſhould be kinder to him, than he hath been to others in the ſame circumſtances.</hi> We cannot ſo much as fancy ſuch a thing, without ſuppoſing them <hi>better-natured, or more gracious,</hi> either of which is at beſt a reproach to our ſelves. And this is but reaſonable for us to think, although we conſider not the influence of God in the caſe, who hath told us, <hi>That he who ſtoppeth his ear againſt the cry of the poor, he alſo ſhall cry, and not be heard;</hi> and hath the hearts of all men in his hand, and can eaſily ſhut them up (in judgment) againſt the cries of thoſe who have ſinfully ſtopped their ears againſt the cries of thoſe who have cried to them in their diſtreſs. Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that it is but reaſonable for us in theſe caſes thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. I have now a fair eſtate, but it is ſubject to decay, a fire may conſume it in a moment, ſoldiers may devour it, either in my or my childrens days: I have now an healthy body, ſound and perfect limbs, I may grow ſickly, loſe my limbs, my ſenſes, and be brought into the condition of a receiver, who am now a giver. Why ſhould I think that any ſhould conſider me, or mine in ſuch circumſtances, more than I conſider others? Let me therefore do unto others, as I would have others do unto
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:192227:170"/>me: I have no reaſon to look, that it ſhould be meted to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, better meaſure then I meaſure unto others. But I have dwelt too long upon this firſt, ſhewing you how the Providence of God doth often retaliate hard heartedneſs, by ſuffering the hearts of others to harden againſt men in ſtraits, who have ſtop't their ears againſt the cries of others to them in diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But there are <hi>other kinds of uncharitableneſs,</hi> which God doth ordinarily repay in their kind. <hi>Thoſe are acts, bearing the higheſt oppoſition to charity,</hi> tending to the utter ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their brethren: ſuch as <hi>murthers, cruelties,</hi> and <hi>barbarous and inhumane uſage of others.</hi> We ſhall find in the old Law, that God in divers caſes eſtabliſhed a <hi>law of Retaliation.</hi> If any miſchief followed ſuch a ſtriking a woman with child, as cauſed a miſcarriage, God ordained they ſhould give <hi>eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, ſtripe for ſtripe,</hi> Exod. 21.23, 24, 25. and in the caſe of a falſe witneſs there was ſuch a law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. which you may read at your leiſure. It was Gods will, that a witneſs who had teſtified falſly againſt any man, (if he were once found a falſe witneſs) ſhould ſuffer the very ſame thing that the other ſhould have ſuffered. So that throughout all the <hi>Jewiſh period,</hi> the Providence of God did (ordinarily) execute this Juſtice by the hands of Magiſtrates. But you muſt not miſtake to think this rule of God was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exceptions; for oftentimes exceptions were made with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the quality of the perſons, and this by the Law of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.16. <hi>He that curſed his father or mother, was to dye the death:</hi> that now was more than like for like: and <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>If a maſter had ſtruck a ſervant, and put out his eye, the maſters pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was only to manumit his ſervant, not to pay eye for eye:</hi> the reaſon was the diſparity of perſons. I might obſerve to you, that the Providence of God directed other Magiſtrates, then thoſe he ſet up amongſt his own people, to enact laws, to render like for like: in many caſes eſpecially, where offences were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently againſt <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> (though with the like reſpect to perſons and other circumſtances) which is enough (by the way) to evidence the juſtice of ſuch laws in many caſes. But further, the Providence of God, in this retaliating ſins of this nature, is eminent in thoſe whom he took to puniſh with his own hand. In the caſe of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he cruelly cauſed the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infants

In the caſe of <hi>Adonibezek, Judg.</hi> 1.6. <hi>The Iſraelites took him, and cut off his thumbs, and great toes.</hi> You never read that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſerved any Enemy ſo, either before or after that time; and doubtleſs what they did, was by an extraordinary inſtinct from God. <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Adonibezek</hi> acknowledgeth the hand of God in it, <hi>Threeſcore and ten Kings</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having their thumbs and great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table; as I have done, ſo God hath requited me,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.33. When <hi>Samuel</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſlay <hi>Agag</hi> by Gods Commandment, obſerve what he ſaith, <hi>As thy ſword hath made many women childleſs: ſo this day thy mother ſhall be made childleſs as to thee, and he cut him in pieces before the Lord.</hi> And this is that which God hath ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.10. <hi>He that leadeth into captivity, ſhall go into captivity: he that killeth with the ſword, ſhall be killed with the ſword:</hi> and in <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.6. ſpeaking of myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> (by which our Forefathers have underſtood <hi>Rome,</hi> though late Authors have otherwiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to interpret it), and the fall of it, ſaith God, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her even as ſhe hath rewarded you, and double unto her double, according to her works; in the cup which ſhe hath filled, fill her double.</hi> You ſee ſtill thoſe whom God hath thus puniſhed from time to time, have ordinarily been great offenders againſt <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> great actors of cruelty; the wickedneſs of theſe men, God hath ordinarily retaliated, and payed them in their own kind. I have hitherto juſtified the firſt part of my obſervation, that God very ordinarily doth repay eminent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners againſt charity in their own kind; what hath been wanting, there's hardly any obſerving Chriſtian but will be able to make up in his daily obſervation; 'tis very ſeldom but God gives cruel and bloody, and miſchievous men blood to drink, and cruelty to digeſt; if he gives it not to them, he ordinarily doth it to their children, as he did to <hi>Saul,</hi> and to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and to <hi>Jehu. Sauls</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were hang'd by <hi>David</hi> at Gods command, for his bloody houſe; <hi>Ahab's</hi> ſeventy Sons were ſlain for his bloodſhed and cruelty. And God repaid the blood which <hi>Jehu</hi> ſhed in <hi>Jeſreel,</hi> (though in it he executed Gods counſel) unto his children, as the Prophet ſaith expreſly. God gave <hi>Manaſſes</hi> his children (<hi>Joſiah</hi> only excepted) blood to drink, to requite him for his filling of <hi>Hieruſalem with innocent blood.</hi>

                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:192227:171"/>2. Let me now juſtifie the Obſervation as to the ſecond part of it. <hi>Gods retaliation of charity:</hi> Charity is a word of a very vaſt extent, and comprehendeth under it all acts of kindneſs done unto our brethren, ſtanding in need of our help. It is a ſaying I have met with ſomewhere, <hi>A man ſeldom himſelf experienceth in himſelf, that miſery which he hath truly felt in others.</hi> Many great and exceeding pretious promiſes are made to it, as if it were all <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> what the Apoſtle ſaith of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable unto it. <hi>It hath promiſes both of this life, and that which is to come. Bleſſed are the merciful</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat</hi> 5.7.) <hi>for they ſhall receive mercy: He that giveth to the poor ſhall not want,</hi> Prov. 28.22. <hi>I have been young</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and now am old; yet I never ſaw the righteous forſaken, nor their ſeed beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their bread: he is ever merciful, and lendeth, and his ſeed is bleſſed.</hi> It were a great work to reckon up all the promiſes of this nature, made to <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> ſo many that the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, the niggardly-handed perſon, muſt neceſſarily be either an Atheiſt, or a notorious Unbeliever, either not believing there is any ſuch God, as the Scriptures ſpeak, or ſuch Scriptures as are the word of God; or not daring to truſt God upon his word; either of them hath a ſoul in ſtate bad enough. But my work is to ſhew you how the Providence of God juſtifieth this word. I told you before how <hi>David</hi> obſerved it in the whole courſe of his life, he never ſaw ſuch a man forſaken, nor his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity beggers. What an experience was that? he was a good man, a wiſe and obſerving man, much acquainted with the world; he had ſeen more than moſt of us, he lived to be an old man; he doth not ſay he had rarely ſeen, no, that was too little. <hi>I have been young,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and now am old, I never ſaw the righteous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</hi> If you would know what righteous man he means, he telleth you, <hi>One that is ever merciful and lendeth.</hi> I think in this caſe we may as to the motions of Providence diſtinguiſh (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth in another caſe between a <hi>righteous man,</hi> and a <hi>good man, Rom.</hi> 5.) The Providence of God doth ſometimes ſo order it, that we ſee religious men, (though it is a hard task, I would not willingly be employed in it, to reconcile an hardneſs of heart in this kind to Religion); yet ſo it is, that we find ſometimes perſons, that in other things we cannot ſay, but they are devout, religious men, and juſt men, and (were it not for that of St. <hi>John, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> after a very
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:192227:172"/>imperfect manner certainly; his brother can ſcarce tell how) for that of St. <hi>James: He that keeps the whole law, and</hi> (in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant track and courſe of his life) <hi>offends but in one point, is guilty of all.</hi> One would think they had love for God, and were righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men: yet when you come to them for an act of charity, oh it grateth them, a ſix-pence comes at two or three pulls, and with many a grudg and excuſe. You may poſſibly ſee ſuch a man decay (God diſtributes his eſtate, becauſe he would not), and ſuch a mans ſeed you may ſee begging bread: But for a good man, <hi>one that diſperſeth abroad, and gives to the poor,</hi> Prov. 3.9, 10. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> never ſaw ſuch a mans ſeed begging their bread: and 'tis no wonder, thouſands of men grow poor by lending; <hi>but he that gives to the poor, lends to the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon):</hi> never any man <hi>loſt by that lending.</hi> The great God never yet failed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet was unfaithful. I could fill your ears with ſtories. I will only give you one or two. It is reported in the life of that famous <hi>Junius,</hi> Miniſter in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> he died but in the year 1602; he met with the Lot of many godly Divines in all ages, as well as ours, and came to be pinched with want, and reſolved for the ſupply of his neceſſities, every each day to dig in the Town-ditch. But ſee the Providence of God, there lived near a Taylor, a young man, whoſe Mother had in <hi>France</hi> lived near to this <hi>Junius</hi>'s mothers houſe, and being very poor, <hi>Junius</hi>'s mother had often relieved her. Her ſon remembreth this kindneſs, and though but a poor man, inviteth <hi>Junius</hi> to his houſe, and provideth meat and lodging for him for ſeven months. I could tell you many, and ſtrange ſtories of Gods repaying Charity in its kind, of little pieces of ſilver given in this kind, repaid with an hundred fold, even in this life. But this is an obſervation which juſtifieth it ſelf in the experience of every one of you. I ſhall rather ſhew you the reaſonableneſs of this motion of Divine Providence, which will be evident to you. I will open it to you in five particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God doth this to evidence his general love to mankind, and ſpecial care of Providence for the needy, the poor, and the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the ſtranger, and the widow.</hi> Juſtice and Charity are the two pillars of the world, all humane ſociety is dependent upon them: <hi>Juſtice,</hi> becauſe as I told you before from <hi>Solomon,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion makes the wiſe-man mad, mens ſpirits will never be calm under a courſe of oppreſſion; hence Tyrants muſt have
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:192227:172"/>conſtant ſtanding-armies to ſecure their luſts. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire is little but <hi>injuſtice</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> it could not ſtand but for his <hi>Janizaries. Charity</hi> is another pillar of the Earth, the reaſon is, becauſe as our Saviour told us, <hi>The poor we ſhall have always with us.</hi> Now God ſheweth his great love to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of men in eminent upholding of both theſe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Scripture ſpeaketh God to have taken the ſpecial patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the poor, and needy, the ſtranger, and widow, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs. God doth this by raiſing them up friends, and it is a great means to raiſe them friends, to incourage them by ſenſible rewards, and that of the ſame kind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is neceſſary, <hi>that</hi> (as our Saviour oft ſaith) <hi>all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhould be fulfilled.</hi> The <hi>promiſes</hi> might have a being given them. I told you before, that the promiſes made to <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>charitableneſs</hi> are very many; now ſome of theſe promiſes are made for a term within this life: <hi>He ſhall not lack</hi> (ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon:</hi>) that muſt be a promiſe reſpecting reward in this life: and ſo for the threatnings againſt cruelty and hard-heartedneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in miſery, or that exerciſe any barbarous dealings towards their brother; ſo that it is neceſſary God ſhould in this life retaliate ſuch wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is neceſſary <hi>for the terror of ſuch ſorts of ſinners.</hi> God himſelf gives this as one of his ends in eſtabliſhing the law of <hi>Retaliation</hi> in the caſe of falſe witneſſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>And thoſe which remain, ſhall hear and fear, and from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth commit no ſuch evil more amongſt you.</hi> The moſt of men hearing that <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> who cut off ſo many Princes <hi>thumbs</hi> and <hi>great toes,</hi> came to be ſerved in the ſame kind himſelf, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of ſuch kind of Inhumanity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again, It is neceſſary for the <hi>conviction of unbelievers.</hi> There are many ſins, againſt which there are dreadful Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Divine Wrath in holy Writ, and the Providence of God gives them a being every day: but yet ſinners will not believe when they ſee the vengeance that comes upon them, that God deſigns to puniſh them for their <hi>unmercifulneſs</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> to their brethren; no, <hi>all things fall alike to all men,</hi> and thoſe that judg otherwiſe, are with them in no better repute, than as bold priers into the ſecrets of God, and judges of his Counſels. God therefore will pleaſe ſometimes to write their ſin in their plague. It ſhall be wrote over the Gallows <hi>fifty cubits high,</hi> upon which
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:192227:173"/>
                     <hi>Haman</hi> was hanged: this was the Gallows which he prepared for <hi>Mordecay.</hi> The accuſers of the three Children ſhall be thrown into the ſame fiery furnace, which they had cauſed to be heated for the three children; and <hi>Daniel</hi>'s accuſers into the ſame <hi>den of Lyons,</hi> in which they would have had him pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed: <hi>He that leadeth into captivity, ſhall be led into captivity: and he that killeth with the ſword, ſhall be killed with the ſword.</hi> When men ſee this, if they will believe any thing, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, It is alſo reaſonable, <hi>for the more perfect demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods favour to theſe exerciſes of grace and vertue.</hi> Our Saviour faith, <hi>All men have not faith.</hi> The moſt of men live, either <hi>meerly</hi> by <hi>ſenſe,</hi> or by <hi>reaſon.</hi> The promiſes of a reward of Heaven, are matters of faith A true believer, only from theſe, underſtands Gods favour to <hi>merciful men;</hi> his faith <hi>being the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> indeed, evidenceth to him Gods love ſufficiently. Inward rewards of grace, are like the <hi>new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name</hi> given unto the People of God, only known to them that have them. The moſt of men are acted by ſenſe, and convinced by that moſtly, (for in this cafe Reaſon will do little). God is therefore pleaſed to reward ſuch perſons to great degrees in this life, and that in the ſame kind too, that all the Earth may know what he will do for ſuch perſons. But I come to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, which I ſhall diſpatch in two branches, making it a foundation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Firſt, for <hi>Admonition to all that hear me, to take heed of theſe ſins.</hi> I would have you brethren take heed of all ſin, for the <hi>wages of every ſin is</hi> (without repentance) <hi>eternal death;</hi> but eſpecially take heed of ſins eminently againſt charity. <hi>Take heed of ſtopping your ears againſt the cry of the poor:</hi> God will be even with you; you, or yours ſhall cry, and not be heard. It is a woful folly for a man ſo to govern himſelf in his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as if he were not ſubject to changes; it ſpeaketh the man that doth it, to be void of underſtanding; and it is a moſt unreaſonable madneſs for a man to expect that from another, which himſelf would not do to another. <hi>Abraham</hi> checks <hi>Dives</hi> in the parable, for thinking that <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould go to fetch him a cup of cold water, when as he in his life-time would not afford him a cup of drink: take heed of <hi>cruelty,</hi>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:192227:173"/>of falſe-witneſſing, of any eminent act of uncharitableneſs. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>he that ſheweth no mercy,</hi> when he comes to need it, ſhall have judgment without mercy for his portion. Take heed of <hi>perſecuting</hi> good people for their conſcience-ſake towards God; it may be you may take the advantage of a furious time, and plunder them a little, or get them impriſoned or oppreſſed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to what is law and juſtice, or directly contrary to the higheſt law, which is the Law of God: but if you do, it is ten to one, but as your hands ſent many to bed, without bread for themſelves and their children to eat, to ſleep, without a bed to lye upon, to work, without a tool to work with; ſo God will find hands, ſhall requite it into your boſom: Or if you ſhould contribute <hi>to make the wives of your brethren widows, and their children, fatherleſs, and vagabonds,</hi> in a good ſenſe to ſeek bread out of deſolate places; God ere long will ſtand over your houſes, and ſay, <hi>Let theſe mens children be fatherleſs, and their wives widows: let their children be continual vagabonds in the earth, and beg, and let them ſeek their bread out of their deſolate places: Let the extortioners catch all they have, and let the ſtrangers ſpoil their labour: let there be none to extend mercy unto them, neither let there be any to favour their fatherleſs children: Let the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of their fathers be remembred with the Lord.</hi> It was the curſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.9. And for what cauſe? they were <hi>adverſaries without a cauſe to David, while he gave himſelf unto prayer,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>They rewarded him evil for good, and hatred for his love.</hi> Oh! my heart akes to think what judgments many in theſe days have laid up for themſelves, and their wives and children: they have ſhewed no mercy, they, or ſome of theirs will find judgment without mercy: God hateth cruelty, and the ſons of violence his foul abhorreth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. This obſervation calleth aloud to you for the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of charity and mercy.</hi> They are virtues, or graces, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of which, God will not only certainly reward; but he maketh haſte to their reward, he ordinarily lets not their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſleep. As it is ſaid of ſome ſinners, <hi>Their damnation ſleepeth not:</hi> ſo as to ſome exerciſe of grace and vertue, it is ſuch a ſweet ſavour in the noſtrils of God, that their recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence ſhall not ſleep till the reſurrection. Let me not hear a mouth opened amongſt my brethren, nor ſee a purſe-ſtring
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:192227:174"/>tyed againſt an act of charity and mercy, it grateth upon my ears. Sirs, give me leave to tell you, that God never came more on borrowing, than he doth in this age. Troops of Robbers have robbed God: they have robbed his Servants, and God accounteth what is done to them, as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Anon it may be, before theſe are gone, another comes, and tells you, that ſuch a Town is burnt down to the ground, many hundred. Families undone, God ſends to you for ſome help for them. Anon another comes to tell you, God hath ſent to borrow a little of you for ſuch a poor ſervant of his, who hath not ſpent his eſtate in Luxury, but God hath blaſted him. Poſſibly God ſends another to you, to lend him a little for another, that is under the Phyſitians hand, or under the Surgeons hand, and hath ſpent all his or her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. O lend it: <hi>He that gives to the poor, lends to the Lord, and he will repay.</hi> Say not (as many of you do) when ſuch come to borrow of you, as you have no mind to lend any too, <hi>Truly I have no money, I can ſpare from my neceſſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions:</hi> When the truth is, thou haſt no money thou art willing to lend ſuch a perſon God ſends on borrowing to thee. He that hath given thee all that thou haſt, hath ſent to thee, to lend him a few ſhillings, a few pence, he hath ſent us his Miniſters upon his errand, or ſome poor ſervant of his; but he hath ſent us with a ticket under his hand, which thou knoweſt, thou owneſt his written word, his holy Scriptures: <hi>Say not thou haſt no money,</hi> if it be true indeed, it is a good excuſe; <hi>or none that thou canſt ſpare from thy neceſſary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> if that be true too, it is a good excuſe: but take heed it be true (remember the caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira).</hi> What mean <hi>the bleating of the ſheep, and the lowing of the oxen?</hi> What mean thy <hi>garments of ſilk, thy coſtly laces, thy feaſting, thy faring deliciouſly every day?</hi> I do not blame theſe things, where there are eſtates to bear them out; ſoft rayment may be worn in Princes houſes: but then, ſay not thou haſt no money, no money for to buy a cap to keep thy brother from the cold, and yet money to buy a coſtly periwig? no money to help thy brother to buy ſo much bread, as to keep him from ſtarving? and yet haſt thou money to furniſh thy table with varieties and dainties? haſt thou no money to help a poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to buy cloathes to cover his nakedneſs? and yet haſt thou
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:192227:174"/>money to laviſh out to cloath thy ſelf and family with ſilks and fine linnen? haſt thou no money to lend to thy Lord, to relieve one of his priſoners? to buy them a bed to lye on, to recover them a ſeat to ſit down upon? and yet canſt thou find enough to buy thy ſelf a cupboard of plate, or the moſt coſtly houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff? O take heed that God judgeth not, that thou haſt <hi>no heart,</hi> thou canſt not truſt that God thou ſo much talkeſt of, and art no more than a prating Chriſtian. But, my brethren, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that acts of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> are ſuch as God ordinarily retaliateth in this life; it is ſeldom that God putteth men to truſt him to another world for rewards in theſe things. It is a time to ſpeak, and I muſt ſpeak in this caſe. It is reported of holy Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> that in an hard time he ſold his <hi>Chains, Rings, and Jewels to relieve thoſe in want.</hi> It is reported of <hi>Baſil,</hi> that in a famine once he ſold all the lands and goods he had to relieve the poor. I ſhall add no more, but conclude my diſcourſe as that of our Saviour; <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</hi> He that believeth what he hath heard this day, and ſearching the Scripture, finds it true, let him be up and doing accordingly. But if any man believeth not the word of God, nor us his ſervants, but hath a mind to make an experiment, whether <hi>Solomon</hi> had any warrant from God to tell the world, <hi>That he that ſtoppeth his ear to the cry of the poor, he alſo ſhall cry, and not be heard;</hi> Let him at his peril try, whether <hi>Solomon</hi> or he was the wiſer man: I know I have ſpoke to many obedient ears, if there be any other, I ſo far my ſelf am aſſured of what I have ſaid, That in theſe things, <hi>Let them do what they pleaſe, I and my houſe</hi> ſhall deſire both to <hi>obey and fear the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>I Am ſtill communicating to you, ſome Obſervations which I have made, concerning the motions of Divine Providence, not only for your inſtruction, but to quicken you alſo to make Obſervations your ſelves upon the motion of it, that you may increaſe in ſpiritual Wiſdom. I proceed to a Tenth Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 10. <hi>That the Providence of God is eminently ſeen in the preſervation and protection of his faithful Miniſters; and ſuch, both amongſt them, and other orders of men, who keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the latitude of their duty, have been great adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers for God in their generations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Providence of God preſerveth both man and beaſt; it is God that upholdeth our ſouls in life, and there is no man but in him <hi>lives, moves,</hi> and hath his <hi>being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor is there any man that liveth any conſiderable time in the world, and keepeth any ordinary record of his life; but will ſee reaſon, as to ſay (with <hi>David) O Lord! I am fearfully and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully made;</hi> ſo alſo, <hi>Lord, I have been fearfully and wonderfully preſerved.</hi> But yet (as I have ſhewed you) there are <hi>ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Divine Providence:</hi> ſome perſons that the Lord ſeemeth to carry upon <hi>eagles wings,</hi> and to preſerve in a more eminent and ſpecial manner; ſometimes in a way of miraculous Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſometimes in a way of extraordinary Providence, in a way beyond other men. Now I have long ſince hinted you three ſorts of men, whom God thus preſerveth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Such as are Gods Vicegerents, Magiſtrates, and Rulers of others.</hi> This I have abundantly ſhewed you, when I ſhewed
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:192227:175"/>you how eminently the Providence of God is ſeen, both in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering, and bringing to light; and alſo in puniſhing ſuch ſins, as tend to the eminent diſturbance of humane Societies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Such as God uſeth for the Miniſters of his Word.</hi> 3. <hi>Such as make the boldeſt adventures for God, and in his ſervice, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves within the latitude of their duty.</hi> I am to juſtifie now this Obſervation to you. I will open it, and prove it, then ſhew you the reaſonableneſs of Divine Providence in theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary motions. And laſtly, I ſhall make ſome Applications.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It is to be underſtood of godly, faithful, and painful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and moſtly of ſuch, of whom God hath made, or doth make, or intend to make an eminent uſe in his Church.</hi> As there are no perſons more juſtly a <hi>hatred in the houſe of God,</hi> abominable to all men of any ſobriety, then leud, or lazy Miniſters; ſo there is nothing of any ſpecial Providence promiſed to them, and it is more than I have obſerved, if God, as to their iſſues in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of this world, hath not left them to a common ſhare with others; and if there hath been any difference made by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, it hath been to their diſadvantage; they are more vile than others, and diſhonour God more than others; and God often makes them and their families to ſmart more than others. It is that which God hath ſaid in the caſe, <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour: and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. We have had a great deal of enquiry in the times wherein we live, into the cauſes of the <hi>contempt of the Clergy, Lev.</hi> 10.2, 3, 4; one hath gueſt this thing, another that; for my own part, I have been young, and am growing old, I never yet knew a <hi>painful able preacher, living an holy and exemplary life,</hi> be his perſwaſion what it would, under a greater contempt than other men: there are ſome Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> will contemn all that are not as much <hi>Atheiſts</hi> as themſelves. If Miniſters will regard nothing but <hi>ſtriking their fleſh-hook with three teeth</hi> into the Lords pot, to feed themſelves; if they will heap up parſonage upon parſonage, till there be no room left in the Earth; and graſp more ſouls than they can manage, putting out ſome to pitiful nurſes, where they are ſtarved, and affording the other but dry beaſts; if they will make themſelves vile, like <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas;</hi> it is no wonder if they be contemned by men of any ſobriety. The Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. makes it the mark of one
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:192227:176"/>that ſhall dwell in Gods holy hill, <hi>in whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned, but he honoureth them that fear the Lord;</hi> for others, God ſecureth their honour eminently.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor is it to be extended to every godly Miniſter, and at all times.</hi> The beſt of Miniſters have their perſonal ſin, for which God may puniſh them by the common fate of others; God eminently ſhewed himſelf for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram:</hi> he made the Earth to open its mouth, and to ſwallow up their oppoſers; but when they had provoked the Lord at the waters of <hi>Meribah,</hi> they took their common fate with the reſt of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and dyed in the wilderneſs, when they had had no more than a proſpect of the promiſed land. Several inſtances might be given of eminent Prophets of old, and Miniſters of the Goſpel, that have periſhed in common judgments: more eſpecially when it hath pleaſed God to pick out ſome of them for <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and to make them witneſſes with their blood, to ſeal the Truths they have preached. And indeed this ſpecial Providence of God hath been moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, in times, when God hath been beginning ſome great work, which was the caſe of the Apoſtles in the firſt Plantation of the Goſpel; and of thoſe eminent ſervants of God, which ſince that time he hath made uſe of in the <hi>reformation of the Church,</hi> or upholding the intereſt of pure and true Religion in a time of great Apoſtacy and defection.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſpecial Providence of God hath not been ſeen uniformly in thoſe caſes, but ſeveral ways.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Sometimes in providing food for them, and theirs, whereas otherwiſe they muſt have ſtarved,</hi> or at leaſt been ſo employed, as they could not have attended the work of God upon their hands.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometimes in keeping them from ſuch dangers,</hi> which have been very near to them, plucking them as brands out of the fire.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Sometimes in the delivering of them out of their Enemies hands,</hi> reſcuing them from the Lyon, when they have been in his paws: ſometimes one way, ſometimes another, accordingly as it hath pleaſed the infinite wiſdom of God to work for them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Providence of God hath been eminently ſeen in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of neceſſaries for his Miniſters.</hi> I need not tell you what ſpecial Laws God made in the caſe of his Miniſtry among the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:192227:176"/>
                     <hi>Jews;</hi> his <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> were particularly taken care of: but this being the ſetled maintenance for thoſe that were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about the Tabernacle, and the Temple, when the Prieſts were generally corrupted, and God to uphold a faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry amongſt his people, raiſed up ſome extraordinary Prophets, that ſhould faithfully reveal his will unto people, they had little or no advantage, but the Lord never failed to provide for them. He provideth a <hi>Shunamite,</hi> 2 King. 4.10, that provideth a <hi>little chamber, a bed, a table, a ſtool, and a candle-ſtick for Eliſha.</hi> And another widow for <hi>Elijah,</hi> that had faith enough to believe, that in the time of famine her <hi>little meal</hi> ſhould not fail from her <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi> nor <hi>her oyl</hi> from her cruſe: He commanded the Ravens to feed the ſame Prophet by the brook <hi>Chereth,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.14. &amp; 4.6. When the brook was dried up, then the Lord commanded the widow to ſuſtain him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. The whole time of the <hi>Kingdom of Iſrael,</hi> from the time that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> revolted, until they were carried away captive, was a ſad time to faithful Miniſters; for all ſuch ſtood for the inſtituted worſhip of God, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> but of all that time, the time of <hi>Ahabs</hi> reign was the moſt perillous time: but then God had provided an <hi>Obadiah, who took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water,</hi> 1 King. 18.5. Under the Goſpel, God alſo declared his will for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his Miniſters. That tythes under the Goſpel are due, <hi>jure divino,</hi> to the Miniſter, I dare not ſay; but that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and honourable maintenance is due to them, the Apoſtle puts beyond all diſpute, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. And if the government of a nation ſettleth it by way of tythes, there is no queſtion to be made of the lawfulneſs, either of giving or taking them: but as the beſt eſtabliſhments are ſubject to mens corruptions; ſo is this.</p>
                  <p>The ſtory of <hi>Merline,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Miniſter, is a known ſtory; being forced ſeveral days to ſave his life, by hiding himſelf in a <hi>hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mow,</hi> God ſends an Hen every day, that laid an egg by him, upon which he lived. The ſtory of <hi>Junius</hi> I told you, relieved by a <hi>Taylor,</hi> when he was put to work in the Town-ditch for a livelihood: God raiſed up a <hi>rich Matron</hi> to provide for <hi>Origen</hi> and his family. But what need we look back ſo far for inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of which all Eccleſiaſtical ſtory is full; when we have ſuch
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:192227:177"/>a plentiful teſtimony at home. There is no order of men, that God in all ages of the Church hath ſo ſtrangely and (miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly almoſt) provided for, as to the neceſſaries of life, as for ſuch who have been faithful and painful labourers in the work of his Goſpel; they have not been forſaken, their ſeed have in no ſcandalous manner begged their bread: but this is but one particular.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond head of inſtances, which I ſhall give you to prove this ſpecialty of Divine Providence, ſhall be the <hi>preventing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God,</hi> warning them ſome way or other, of evil that hath been towards them, ſo as they have been able timely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or eſcape it. <hi>Elijah</hi> was you know an eminent Prophet of the Lords, and his life was often in danger; but God hid him one while at the brook <hi>Cherith,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17, after he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that unpleaſing Prophecy to <hi>Ahab;</hi> another time, at <hi>Beer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi> after he had made ſuch an havock amongſt the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> Chap. 18, 19. God gave him warning of his dangers, and prevented <hi>Jezebel's</hi> deſigns. A boy overhears <hi>Pauls</hi> Enemies conſpiring his death, and revealeth it, and he is ſent away: at another time he is let down in a basket. Infinite inſtances might be given you out of other ſtory. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> amongſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and <hi>Luther</hi> amongſt more modern Divines, were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent inſtances of this nature. God indeed (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) doth not make all his Miniſters in times of dangers, ſuch inſtances of ſpecial Providence, but only ſuch as he hath deſigned to make great and eminent uſe of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I might alſo give you as large a proof of this ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, for the Miniſters of his Goſpel, <hi>in his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them out of trouble,</hi> when they have been within the paws of the Lyon, and ready to be devoured. And this not always in the ſame method, nor by the ſame way and means; ſometimes miraculouſly, as in the caſe of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> more than once, ſtriking their Enemies with blindneſs, cauſing fire to come down from Heaven, and to deſtroy their Enemies. In the caſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſtopping the mouths of the Lyons. In the caſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> the very night before that <hi>Herod</hi> was fully intended to have murthered him. In later ſtory we have infinite inſtances
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:192227:177"/>of Gods ſtrange deliverance of faithful Miniſters (whom it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward appeared, God deſigned to make eminent uſe of) out of their Enemies hands. I remember in the Hiſtory of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Church of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> we read of an Edict made by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to apprehend all the Proteſtant-Miniſters; upon which many fled into <hi>Moravia,</hi> and hid themſelves; three were taken and kept priſoners in a deep dungeon at <hi>Prague:</hi> but God by his Providence wrought the eſcape of one of them, whom he made uſe of to plant, not leſs than twenty Proteſtant-Churches afterwards in <hi>Poland.</hi> But there would be no end, if I ſhould begin to recite to you all we find in his ſtory of this nature; there can be none ſo meanly acquainted with Scripture or Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but may confirm himſelf in this obſervation. But I added, <hi>That the Providence of God hath been alſo eminently ſeen in the preſervation of thoſe, who have been great adventurers in the cauſe of God, within the latitude of their duty.</hi> A man may adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the cauſe of God, and miſcarry in his adventure, and that in two caſes: 1. <hi>When he adventures without a call from God.</hi> 2. <hi>When he governeth not himſelf in his adventure, by the reaſonable rules of prudence. Peter</hi> made an adventure, when he drew out the ſword, and cut off the higheſt Prieſt's ſervants ear: <hi>But our Saviour bid him put up the ſword into its ſheath again; for he that draweth the ſword</hi> (being a private perſon) <hi>ſhall periſh by the ſword. Peter</hi> had no call to uſe the ſword in the caſe: The Magiſtrate hath a call to uſe the ſword in the execution of juſt laws. The Miniſter hath a call to uſe another ſword, <hi>the ſword of the ſpirit,</hi> which is the word of God. Every Chriſtian hath a call to ſerve and obey Magiſtrates, in what is juſt and lawful, and to perform thoſe duties, which in his private capacity he oweth unto God; to worſhip God in his family, and to meet often together in the congregation of Gods People, to hear the word, to partake of the Ordinances of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now there are times when a godly Magiſtrate cannot do his duty in puniſhing of ſin, without the adventure of his reputation in a wicked world; the adventure of his eſtate, his life: when the Miniſter of the Goſpel cannot do his duty, nor the people theirs, without the like adventures: but you ſhall obſerve this very ordinary in the Providence of God, he ſtrangely watcheth over, and protecteth ſuch as have a ſpirit to make boldeſt adventures, and as ſtrangely rewardeth ſuch. You ſee it in the whole ſtory
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:192227:178"/>of Scripture, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were called to go in to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and to demand the diſmiſſion of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> God ſuffereth not <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> nor any of his Courtiers (notwithſtanding their threats) to do them any hurt. <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah</hi> adventure to bring up a good report of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecteth them from the mutiny of the people, and they are the only two are ſuffered to go over into the promiſed land, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.6, 7, 10, 24. <hi>Elijah,</hi> the <hi>three children,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were great adventurers in the caſe of God: ſo was <hi>Eſther</hi> in her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in to the King, to ſpeak for the <hi>Jews:</hi> ſo were the Apoſtles in the firſt Plantation of the Goſpel. The Providence of God ſtrangely watched over them, and delivered them, as you read in the ſtory of their Acts. A man cannot be too bold, if he keeps within the latitude of his duty. Indeed we read of ſome whom God ſtrangely watched over, in the doing of ſome actions, that we cannot evince to have been their duty, as that of <hi>Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has, Numb.</hi> 25.7, 8. <hi>in killing the Moabitiſh-woman, and the Iſraelite in the act of adultery.</hi> That of <hi>Elijah's</hi> killing <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18; yet God protected them, and rewarded them; there are many things ſaid in the defence of <hi>Phinehas</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> to reduce their actions to the ordinary rule of Juſtice. It is certain, that by the Laws of God, the adulterers ought to have dyed, ſo alſo the falſe Prophets; but for the perſons that executed the vengeance of God upon them, all that we can ſay, is this: <hi>Their call was doubtleſs clear to themſelves, their actions were moſt certainly approved by God:</hi> he protects them upon the doing of them, he rewards them for doing of them; but <hi>non fue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>unt ordinaria, ſed facta quaedam extra uſum, &amp; ordinem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munem;</hi> they were not ordinary actions, but depended upon a ſpecial call of God. By vertue of ſuch a call too, it doubtleſs was, that <hi>Moſes ſlew the Egyptian,</hi> for which St. <hi>Stephen juſtifieth him,</hi> Acts 7. But a man cannot be too bold for God, if he keeps within the latitude of his certain duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Provided ſecondly, <hi>He keepeth to reaſonable rules of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> our rule obligeth us to be <hi>wiſe as ſerpents.</hi> But I will not enlarge upon this Theme; for the truth is, the Providence of God ſtrangely watcheth over bold adventurers in his cauſe and ſervice, who have acted under ſuch circumſtances, as are hardly reconcileable to what our reaſon calls Prudence; yet certainly, that will not warrant a raſh and imprudent managery
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:192227:178"/>of a good cauſe. I need not give you more inſtances than I have done, to juſtifie this Obſervation in ſacred Hiſtory. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah, Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha, Eſther, Daniel,</hi> the <hi>three Children,</hi> all the Apoſtles afford a plentiful proof of this Obſervation; and in other ſtories the inſtances are without number. <hi>Luthers</hi> whole life was an inſtance of this, the <hi>Archers ſhot ſorely at him,</hi> he ventured as high as any in oppoſition to them; <hi>yet his bow abode in his ſtrength, Luther</hi> dyed in his bed in peace.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth this ſeem an unreaſonable motion of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if we either conſider how far the honour of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the upholding and maintaining his Embaſſadors, and rewarding his ſervants; or the faithfulneſs of God in juſtifying his promiſes, or the further uſe that God will make of men in the accompliſhment of his deſigns in the world.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us but conſider <hi>the relation wherein the Miniſters of Chriſt ſtand to him,</hi> they are his <hi>Miſſionaries,</hi> be hath ſent them; <hi>as the father hath ſent him, ſo he hath ſent them;</hi> nay, they are no ordinary ſervants, they are the Lords <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> they come <hi>in Chriſts name,</hi> and as <hi>in Chriſts ſtead</hi> they intreat men to be reconciled unto God. It is beneath the honour of a Prince to ſuffer an Embaſſador to ſtarve, or any way to periſh for want of that protection which he is able to afford him; indeed, if any run before they are ſent, or inſtead of Gods work to their own, Gods honour is not concerned in them, unleſs to chaſtiſe their preſumption, and to take vengeance upon them, as in ſuch a caſe, no Prince would think himſelf further concerned: but ſuppoſing Miniſters of the Goſpel to be ſent by him, and to be ready faithfully to deliver their maſters meſſages (and this we muſt ſuppoſe and believe, or diſown the Scriptures, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſert this), God is highly concerned in point of honour (having power in his hand, and the command of all the hearts of men) to provide for his faithful Miniſters, and they ſhall not want.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God (ſecondly) is not only concerned in honour, as a great King and God above all; but as a God of <hi>truth and faithfulneſs,</hi> that can ſooner ſuffer Heaven and Earth to paſs away, then a word to fail of what he hath ſpoken: he hath made many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to his faithful ſervants in the Miniſtry, and to thoſe that he hath employed in hazardous employments for him; he of old
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:192227:179"/>promiſed to <hi>ſatiate the ſouls of his prieſts with fatneſs,</hi> Jer. 31.14. He of old appointed no inheritance to the ſons of <hi>Levi,</hi> amongſt their brethren, becauſe he was <hi>their inheritance,</hi> as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.9. he hath told them <hi>he will cloath them with ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 132.16. he told <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> he would be <hi>with them to deliver them,</hi> Jer. 1.7, 8, 18, 19. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.6. He hath told Goſpel Miniſters, <hi>he will be with them to the end of the world,</hi> Matth. 28. he hath bidden them <hi>take no thought what they ſhould eat, drink, or put on,</hi> when he ſent out the twelve, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.9, 10. he bid them to provide, <hi>neither gold, nor ſilver, nor braſs in their purſes, nor ſcrip for their journey, nor two coats, nor ſhooes, for the workman is worthy of his meat.</hi> Now after all this, if God ſhould ſuffer his Miniſters to want bread to ſuſtain their lives, or their families, what would men ſay of the faithfulneſs of God?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Let us but conſider God, <hi>as having many deſigns yet to accompliſh, a great deal of work yet to be done in the world, to be done by the hands of men,</hi> who can imagine God ſhould not emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently protect, and provide for thoſe that are, and have been faithful? who would work for that Maſter, that will not find them bread? What ſubject would be free to go as an Embaſſadour for that Prince, that would never protect him in the faithful diſcharge of his truſt, or reward him proportionably to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts or loſſes? Now God knows that we are fleſh, and much led by our ſenſe and reaſon, and muſt not be encouraged to our duty only by rewards, which are the objects of our faith; but by ſenſible rewards, at leaſt to ſuch a proportion as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to uphold us to our work. It is therefore not to be wondred at, that God ſhould in a way of ſpecial Providence, eminently take care of the Miniſters of his Goſpel: he hath call'd them, and ſent them to his work, he hath by that call taken them off from that purſuit of the world, by which others procure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a livelihood; he hath told them they ſhould live upon his Altar; he hath told us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. <hi>That no man goeth to a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare at his own charge, none planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof, nor feedeth a flock, and eateth not the milk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi> he ſeeth them out of obedience and conſcience to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the bread they might have: men will not provide for them, he will; <hi>Ravens</hi> ſhall bring them meat every day, but they ſhall
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:192227:179"/>be fed. This is but a reaſonable motion of Divine Providence. I ſhall make a ſhort Application of this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This in the firſt place <hi>lets you ſee the fountain of that bounty, which the many painful and faithful ſervants of Chriſt have experienced in all times, and even in the days wherein we live.</hi> It hath pleaſed God in all times to raiſe up friends to his faithful Miniſters. I remember when <hi>Abigail</hi> came to meet <hi>David,</hi> coming againſt her husband, and had ſtopt his journey, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith unto her, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, which ſent thee to meet me this day: and bleſſed be thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and bleſſed be thou,</hi> &amp;c. Firſt, <hi>he bleſſeth God,</hi> then <hi>he bleſſeth her;</hi> the faithful ſervants of God, yea the Churches of God, who by this means enjoy any thing of the labours of their ſhepherds, have reaſon to bleſs thoſe whom God hath made his inſtruments to ſupport thoſe upon whom others had no pity. Yea verily, and what our Saviour ſaid of the woman that ſpent her box of Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, I think I may apply here, <hi>Wherever the Goſpel is preached, what they have done ſhall be told for a memorial of them.</hi> If a cup of cold-water for a thirſty Prophet ſhall obtain a Prophets reward, the greater kindneſſes of many ſhall certainly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; they have but put a little money into the bank which God keeps in Heaven. But we have more reaſon to look upward to him, who hath the hearts of all men in his hand, and openeth them as he pleaſeth. God hath in it ſhewed his ſpecial Providence for his faithful Miniſters; let us therefore ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who hath ſtirred them up.</hi> It was the grace of God <hi>beſtowed upon the Churches in Macedonia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.1, 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>which taught them in a great tryal of affliction, and deep poverty, to abound in riches of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and willingly of themſelves to give to their power, yea and above their power.</hi> Let it be written to poſterity, for a memorial of the people in <hi>England,</hi> that for ſo many years together, in the midſt of a devouring peſtilence, many conſuming fires, expenſive wars, and a deadneſs of trade, they have refreſhed the bowels of ſo many hundreds (if not thouſands) of Gods meſſengers; but let God have all the glory, who hath given the heart, though their hands diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the money.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. In the ſecond place, Let me cry out, <hi>O houſe of Aaron, truſt in the Lord: O houſe of Levi, truſt in the Lord: Truſt in the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:192227:180"/>Lord, and do good</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>ſo ſhalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou ſhalt be fed,</hi> Pſal. 37.3. <hi>Let us be faithful to our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſervice, and do the work which he hath given us to do, and verily we ſhall be fed.</hi> I cannot ſay God will provide <hi>Coaches,</hi> and delicate things for us; but neceſſaries we ſhall not want. Herein let us exerciſe our ſelves to keep a conſcience void of offence, both towards God, and towards men; and as to other things, we may truſt a <hi>Providebit Deus,</hi> God will provide for us and ours. The experience of theſe times, if wiſtly attended to, certainly is enough to keep any from being tempted through fear of want, to debauch their conſciences, by doing any thing which is apparently ſinful, or but ſo judged and ſuſpected by them.

Laſtly, This obſervation commendeth <hi>confidence and courage to all in the Lords work,</hi> in oppoſition to fear and cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. I would not be miſtaken, be ſure in the firſt place you be in Gods work, that which by his word appeareth to be the duty of one in thy circumſtances: nothing but the conſcience of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſurpriſed in the way of our duty, will bear us up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſufferings; be therefore in that point well ſatisfied: having done that, obſerve thoſe rules of Prudence which reaſon directs thee in ſuch caſes: this done, fear nothing. Remember the Providence of God moſt eminently watcheth over the boldeſt adventurers in the way of their duty. They are the words of our bleſſed Lord, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.35. <hi>Whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it: but whoſoever ſhall loſe his life for my ſake, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſhall ſave it.</hi> They obſerve in war, that the ſoldier that turns his back, and flyes, is in much more danger, than he who ſtands to it; and that nothing makes a conqueror, ſo much as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,</hi> and bold adventuring: it is ſo in our ſpiritual fight with the world; be then of good courage in it, and quit your ſelves like men; remember God is with you, and if ſo, there's more with you, than can be againſt you. God indeed in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats with the world, doth not always keep us ſhot-free, and bring us off without a ſcratch; but thoſe whom he doth bring
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:192227:180"/>off, are ordinarily thoſe who are moſt valiant and adventurous: however, it is better to fall valiantly, than cowardly; and our Lord hath told us, <hi>That if a man will ſave his life, he ſhall loſe it;</hi> if he hath ſuch a mind to ſleep in a whole skin, that he will neglect his duty, and do that which his heart condemneth him for doing, he ſhall loſe what he hoped to ſave by it, be it life, reputation, eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſpeaketh great unbelief, and diſtruſt in God, to be cowards in plain and certain duties. Be prudent, but take heed of forbearing neceſſary duty out of prudence, or being faint in the performance of it. That can be no prudence: <hi>If a man fainteth in the day of adverſity, Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>that his ſtrength is but ſmall,</hi> his faith is but ſmall, and his obſervation of Gods Providence in ſuch caſes hath been very ſmall too. But I ſhall add no more upon this Argument.</p>

                  <p>I Have done with the Tenth thing in the motions of Divine Providence, which I commended to your obſervation. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to another.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 11. <hi>The Providence of God maketh a very frequent and remarkable uſe of the ſins of people, though it be always ſpotleſs in making ſuch uſe of mens ſins.</hi> That the Providence of God in bringing about the eternal purpoſes and counſels of God, doth very ordinarily make uſe of peoples ſins, I have in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure already proved to you under my ſeventh Obſervation, where I ſhewed you how God accompliſhed his purpoſes upon <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> by perſons that meant not ſo, and over-ruled the ſeveral luſts of ſinners hearts to his own praiſe, <hi>making the wrath
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:192227:181"/>of men to praiſe him.</hi> But yet I ſhall take it again in my way, and the rather, becauſe I will ſhew you more eſpecially what uſe God makes of the ſins of his own people. Then I ſhall give you a reaſonable account of this great work of God. And thirdly, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you, that <hi>it is a ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs uſe</hi> which God maketh, and open it to you, how it may be ſo, and our reaſon may conceive of it well enough. And laſtly, I ſhall make ſome Application.</p>
                  <p>That it is ſo, is ſo obvious to thoſe that are meanlieſt exerciſed in the Scriptures, that it can hardly be overlooked by any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate perſon.</p>
                  <p>One of the moſt glorious products of <hi>Actual Providence,</hi> was the Revelation of the <hi>Covenant of Grace and Redemption:</hi> I ſay the Revelation of it; for the <hi>paction,</hi> or making of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, I take that to be eternal, and antecedent to the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but as I take it, thoſe who would diſtinctly underſtand the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>Paction,</hi> the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation</hi> of it, and the <hi>Application</hi> of it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual ſouls. The <hi>Paction</hi> was an act of Counſel, an eternal act, a tranſaction between the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> the Son as the head of the elect, ſtanding as a <hi>ſurety</hi> for <hi>believers,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking ſomething for himſelf on their behalf; that in the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of time, he would come into the world, aſſume our natures, and in that nature dye, and give ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice for the ſins of the elect: (which ſome call the <hi>Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) alſo undertaking for them, that they in his ſtrength, and through the aſſiſtance of his ſpirit, ſhould do whatſoever his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould require perſonally of them, in order to their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſalvation through him. But now the <hi>Exhibition</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> of this eternal contrivement to the world, that was the work of <hi>Actual Providence,</hi> done in time ſubſequent to the Creation, and done <hi>gradually,</hi> as to the more full and perfect Revelation of it, according to the good pleaſure and infinite wiſdom of God. The firſt Revelation of it was to <hi>Adam,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had fallen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And I will put enmity betwixt thee</hi> [that is the ſerpent] <hi>and the woman, and betwixt thy ſeed and her ſeed, it ſhall bruiſe thine head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe its heel.</hi> Now for this, God made uſe of the firſt ſin that was committed in the world, the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> had not <hi>Adam</hi> fallen, there had been no need of the Revelation of a Covenant of Grace; he,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:192227:181"/>and his poſterity had been ſaved upon the Covenant of Works, he had perfectly done the Will of God, and lived, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12. The Apoſtle tells us, that before <hi>Eſau</hi> or <hi>Jacob</hi> were born, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had done good or evil, God loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau;</hi> and it was foretold, <hi>That the elder ſhould ſerve the younger;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 25.3.</note> for the law of God and Nature, had made the younger a ſervant to the elder. Firſt, <hi>Eſau</hi> ſells his birthright for a meſs of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; then <hi>Jacob</hi> by the counſel of <hi>Rebeccah</hi> comes, and tells his Father a lye, and obtaineth the bleſſing of the firſt-born: both ſinful acts; the firſt on <hi>Eſau's</hi> part, the ſecond on <hi>Jacob's;</hi> but Gods Providence makes uſe of both, to bring about his counſels. There was a promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that God would mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply his ſeed, and that they ſhould inherit the land of <hi>Canaan: Pharaoh</hi> ſtrongly ſets himſelf againſt it, uſeth all arts to deſtroy the ſeed of <hi>Jacob;</hi> the King commandeth the midwives to kill all the <hi>male children, Exod.</hi> 1. they ſave them alive, the King queſtioneth them for it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.17, 19. they tell a lye to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves; God makes uſe of their lye for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his counſels, and the fulfilling of his promiſe unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> Who can excuſe <hi>Rahab</hi> in the lye ſhe told to the Kings meſſengers, ſent to apprehend the ſpies? It is true, the Apoſtle ſaith, ſhe did it by faith, and God rewarded her, as he did the <hi>Egyptian</hi> midwives: <hi>Rahab</hi> did it <hi>by faith,</hi> believing what at that time ſhe did not ſee, that God would give that land to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and God rewarded her good intention in the general, not her particular ſinful act: but yet the Providence of God made a great uſe of her lye, for the deſign he had in hand. Who can excuſe <hi>David</hi> in many particular actions which he did? Which yet God made uſe of in order to the bringing about his counſels and promiſe concerning <hi>David,</hi> in ſettling him upon the Throne of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah:</hi> The ſetting up of <hi>Solomon</hi> upon the Throne of his Father <hi>David,</hi> was an eminent product of Actual Providence; but <hi>Bathſheba</hi> you know was his mother, and <hi>David</hi> in order to the having her for his wife, murthered <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> her husband, yet ſhe was the mother of <hi>Solomon.</hi> No man can excuſe <hi>Jeroboam</hi> in his revolt from the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> he did what he did from a very turbulent and ill ſpirit, and in a very irregular and rebellious manner: but God yet made uſe of what he had done to fulfil his own counſels, and the threatning he had denounced againſt <hi>Solomon.</hi> In ſhort, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:192227:182"/>inſtances of this nature might be given, and it is an eaſie thing to obſerve God doing the ſame thing every day. I will inſtance but in three great products of Actual Providence more, which the Scripture maketh mention of; and three greater have not been, nor can be. 1. <hi>The incarnation of our bleſſed Lord.</hi> In the genealogy of Chriſt recorded by <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 1. ver. 3. you read, <hi>Judas begat Pharez,</hi> and <hi>Zarah of Thamar.</hi> You have the ſtory <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.29. <hi>Pharez</hi> was an inceſtuous child, which <hi>Judah</hi> had by his own Daughter-in-law: he was one of Chriſts Progenitors; ſo was <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> who came with much ſin to be <hi>David's</hi> wife; yet God made uſe, you ſee, both of the ſin of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the ſin of <hi>David,</hi> for the bringing forth his ſon into the world. Next to his Incarnation, let us conſider <hi>the ſacrifice of Chriſt for the expectation of our ſins,</hi> the nobleſt and greateſt act of Providence which was ever brought forth in the world, it was produced by wicked hands. <hi>Judas, Pilate, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> all have their hand in it. The Devil put the malice into the heart of <hi>Judas;</hi> but God had his end in the action, and accompliſhed the great deſign of his glory. The ſending of the Goſpel amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was a great product of Providence in the fulfilling of the Lords counſels, and many promiſes: but it was the <hi>fall of the Jews,</hi> that proved the riches of the world, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11, 12. <hi>They did not ſtumble that they might fall: but through their fall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealouſie.</hi> The Apoſtles upon their going out to preach to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> gives this account of it, <hi>Foraſmuch as you have judged your ſelves unworthy of eternal life,</hi> (that was, by not receiving the Goſpel) <hi>we turn unto the Gentiles.</hi> What ſhall I need ſay more? there is no ſoul brought to Heaven, but is an eminent inſtance of this: <hi>If they had not ſinned, they would have no need of any pardon or juſtification</hi> from the guilt of ſin, no need of a Saviour or Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: God ſuffereth the ſouls of his People to be concluded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of ſin, that he might have mercy upon them. It is alſo an ordinary obſervation of Divines, That God often ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth people to fall into ſome groſs and ſcandalous ſins, that he might take that advantage to awaken them to repentance, and make uſe of their falls to a riſing again to a new life: and this is often ſeen in thoſe that have lived civilly, and might be prone to truſt to their own Moral Righteouſneſs. But I ſhall inlarge
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:192227:182"/>no further in the Juſtification of ſo obvious an Obſervation. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that I ſhould ſhew you the reaſonableneſs of this motion of Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The truth is (in the firſt place), <hi>it is hard to conceive, how otherwiſe ſome of Gods greateſt works of Providence could have been produced.</hi> What would the Revelation of a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> have ſignified to the world, if the Covenant of Works had not firſt been violated by the firſt mans tranſgreſſion? How could elſe any man imagine, that the ſalvation of the world ſhould have been accompliſhed by the <hi>death of Chriſt,</hi> if God had not made uſe of the wicked action of thoſe who took him, and by wicked hands crucified him? The Apoſtle aſſureth us, that in all they did againſt our Lord, they did but execute <hi>what the counſel of the Lord had predetermined ſhould be done: If ſin did not abound, how ſhould grace much more abound?</hi> Rom. 5. In the pardon of ſins, the juſtification of a guilty ſoul; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, <hi>That all are concluded under ſin, that the promiſe by faith in Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> What ſhould we ſay to the great work of Providence, in trying his Saints by <hi>afflictions</hi> and <hi>perſecutions,</hi> from the hands of violent men? God maketh uſe of the ſins of Perſecutors, to perfect his Saints by the exerciſes of their faith and patience; it could not be, without the ſins of thoſe who perſecute others <hi>for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>God by this getteth himſelf a great deal of glory.</hi> I have ſpoke ſomething to this under the ſeventh Obſervation: but let me here add a little.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He gets himſelf the <hi>glory of his power.</hi> There is a fancy hath poſſeſſed the Philoſophers of the world, That metals of a baſer nature, may by art be turned into nobler metals, braſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into gold; and they will tell you, that ſome ſuch thing hath been done; and aboundance of time and money hath been ſpent, by the vain and covetous Philoſophers of the world to little purpoſe, to find out this Philoſophers ſtone (as they call it): but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch a thing poſſible; yet there muſt be ſome ſimilar qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to help, or they will not pretend to any ſuch thing; no Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ever yet pretended by all his <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> to fetch gold out of a dunghil. But now in ſin, there is nothing of a ſimilar quality to the glory of God; there is nothing ſo oppoſite to the glory of God, as the ſins of men and women: For God to fetch
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:192227:183"/>water out of a rock, argued great power; to raiſe up <hi>Abraham</hi> children from the ſtones of the field, it muſt ſpeak great power: but yet not ſo much, as for God to fetch his own glory out of peoples ſins. There is in ſin an infinite oppoſition to the glory of God: nothing ſo diametrically oppoſite to God's honour and glory, as ſin is. <hi>Sampſon</hi> put forth a riddle, <hi>Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the ſtrong came forth ſweetneſs.</hi> But what is this riddle to that which I am ſpeaking of? for the glory of God to come forth out of the <hi>dunghil,</hi> the woful dunghil of the worſt of mens actions? for God to work out his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs out of the vileſt actions of men? O it ſpeaketh an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power in God! it is a greater work to fetch <hi>light</hi> out of <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I will</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>get me glory upon Pharaoh:</hi> For God to get himſelf glory out of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> hard heart, was more than to get his people water out of an hard rock.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God by it gets himſelf the glory of his infinite wiſdom.</hi> I told you in my former diſcourſe, that he is accounted the beſt Politician, that can make the beſt uſe of all humours, and ſerve his own deſigns, even of his utter Enemies: this is the top of a Politicians wiſdom: How great then muſt the Wiſdom of God appear in this? nothing hath ſuch an enmity to God and his glory, as ſin hath. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh it to the great glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, <hi>Job</hi> 5.13. <hi>He taketh the wiſe in their own crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the counſels of the crafty are carried head long.</hi> It ſpeaketh the wiſdom of a man, that he can make uſe of the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious quality of a bird, or a beaſt, to catch a prey for him: thus the <hi>faulconer</hi> maketh uſe of the hawk, the huntſman of the dog, the fiſher-man of a fowl, to catch birds, or beaſts, or fiſh for him. This I ſay ſpeaketh the wiſdom of a man above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures; O how it ſpeaketh the admirable Wiſdom of God, that he can make uſe of the worſt belchings of luſts in mens hearts, the moſt vile and rebellious actions of men, and out of them fetch his own glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But in the laſt place, <hi>God above all doth by this magnifie the riches and freeneſs of his grace.</hi> This is that wherein the Lord delights to have glory; <hi>he predeſtinated, adopted us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> Eph. 1.6. If God had taken man out of a ſtate of innocency into Heaven, we ſhould never have admired free-grace ſo much as now; it marvellouſly affects the heart of a child of God, to ſee God make uſe of his
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:192227:183"/>falls of his ſin and corruption, and manifold rebellions, to make his free-grace exceeding glorious. We ſhould never ſo much admire free-grace and mercy, if we were not ſo great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors: This is it which maketh grace precious in our eyes, when we cry out of the belly of hell, and he heareth us.</p>
                  <p>Thus far I have ſhewed you, that God maketh a very ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſe, and a very remarkable uſe of peoples ſins. But I alſo added, that it was a <hi>ſpotleſs uſe;</hi> and thus it muſt be, if God maketh it; <hi>For he that is of purer eyes, than that he can behold iniquity, muſt be of a purer will, than to will iniquity, and of purer hands than to work iniquity.</hi> But the difficulty lyeth here. It is plain from this diſcourſe, that God <hi>uſeth peoples ſins</hi> as a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium to his glory;</hi> he having willed the end, muſt needs have <hi>willed the means:</hi> for though a thing may be fortuitous to man, yet nothing is fortuitous, or caſual to God. A man now in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the accompliſhment of ſome deſign of his, may make uſe of ſome things which fall in, and he never foreſaw, nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, nor deſign'd as a means in order to his accompliſhment, but it were blaſphemy to ſuppoſe any ſuch thing of God.</p>
                  <p>A great queſtion there is amongſt Divines, what influence God hath upon the ſinful actions of men. It falleth not ſo fully in my way at preſent, as to engage me in any full diſcourſe upon it. Certain it is, that the <hi>holy God putteth malice into the heart of no man, nor doth at all incite him to any ſinful actions.</hi> This were indeed to make God the Author of ſin: he commands it not (that is impoſſible), he approveth it not, he inclineth not the will of man unto it: But as certain it is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That he aſſiſteth the faculties and members of a man to thoſe natural actions,</hi> which his own luſt and malice maketh ſinful. He aſſiſted the tongues of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> to ſpeak, but it was their own luſt and malice, which inclined them rather to ſpeak that which was falſe, than the truth. <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As certain it is, <hi>That he permitteth and ſuffereth men to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their luſts,</hi> otherwiſe they could not execute them, he could moſt certainly hinder them: <hi>Forty years he ſuffered the Jews manners in the wilderneſs,</hi> Acts 13.18. <hi>He ſuffered all nations to walk in their own ways,</hi> Act. 14.16. Now for this ſufferance, I think it is well expreſſed by an eminent Divine of our own; <hi>Gods permiſſion of ſin</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lyes in the ſuſpenſion of his own
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:192227:184"/>efficiency, and the removal of the impediments. Pelagians</hi> dream, that God gave unto man a perfect freedom of will, and ſo did, as it were, <hi>Dormitare in operibus ſuis,</hi> ſleep while his Enemies ſowed the tares of ſin; but no ſuch thing muſt be imagined of God. Nor doth God only remove thoſe impediments, by which the ſinner might be hindred in his acts of ſin; he is properly ſaid to be hindred in an action, who cannot do what he hath a mind to do: now God doth ſomething more in his permiſſion of mens ſins, than <hi>not hinder</hi> their commiſſion of it; he <hi>ſuſpendeth</hi> that <hi>efficiency,</hi> by which they were reſtrain'd, or which ſhould incline them to do otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>He willeth that the ſin ſhould be, though he doth not will to effect it.</hi> Indeed for God to will the effecting or committing of ſin, is not conſiſtent with the purity and holineſs of God: God's permiſſion of ſin, and willing it in the effect, doth <hi>ponere effectum non cauſam,</hi> it doth aſſert the effect, not the cauſe; his willing it in this ſenſe, doth by no means imply his procuring it, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it, or approbation of it. It is not <hi>procurans volitio;</hi> and here Divines ſay rightly, <hi>Deus abſ<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> jactura, &amp; ſanctitatis offendiculo, velle poteſt peccata; vult rem effici, non effectum dare.</hi> He willeth the thing ſhould be done, but he doth not will the doing of it. Who ſhall dare to ſay that God did not will that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould betray Chriſt, and <hi>Pilate</hi> condemn him, and that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould crucifie him? When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That they did but according to whatſoever Gods hand and counſel had determined before to be done,</hi> Act. 4.28. <hi>And that he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the determinate counſel and foreknowledg of God,</hi> Act. 2.23. If God did not will that moſt vile action ſhould be done, how did his <hi>hand and counſel determine it?</hi> How was he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the counſel of God, which the Scripture expreſly affirms? And this is all that I know, that Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> or any that tread in his ſteps have ſaid, which many now a-days have ſo clamoured againſt, as if he made God the <hi>Author of ſin,</hi> and <hi>willed acts of ſin.</hi> Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and all ſober Divines will grant them, that it is inconſiſtent with the holy nature of God, to infuſe malice into the hearts of any, or to incite any to any malicious and ſinful action, or to aſſiſt them in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and obliquity of their action: but thoſe who have read <hi>Pareus</hi>'s diſputes with the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> at <hi>Swalbach,</hi> will eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, what <hi>Divines</hi> theſe men read, and with <hi>whoſe heifers
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:192227:184"/>they plow,</hi> and out of whoſe <hi>quivers</hi> they draw their arrows of bitter words. To whom the beſt anſwer, is that of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel to the Devil, <hi>The Lord rebuke them.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Then laſtly, <hi>God governeth the wicked actions of men, when they are done to his own praiſe and glory,</hi> and maketh an eminent uſe of them; but yet a ſpotleſs uſe. Take <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his heart, againſt the Will of God revealed to him for the diſmiſſion of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> God had purpoſed that <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart ſhould harden, he tells <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo long before it came to iſſue: God removed what might have hindred the hardening of his heart, he would believe from time to time, that God had done his worſt, and he ſhould keep them, let the mighty God do what he could: he ſuſpended his own efficiency, he could have ſoftned <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, if he had pleaſed; he <hi>aſſiſted</hi> him to his natural actions, he could never elſe have ſpoken the words he did, nor made ready a Chariot. When the action was done, he governed it to his own praiſe and glory, he ſaid, <hi>I will get me glory upon Pharaoh;</hi> and he did get himſelf glory upon him, and made <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> wrath to praiſe him. But I will add no more to the Explication, or proof of this Obſervation.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This now in the firſt place may convince us of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>power, wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>goodneſs of God.</hi> Omnipotency is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thought to be moſt diſcovered in Creation, the production of things out of a meer not-being, into a being, where there is no pre-exiſtent matter for God to work upon: but here ſeemeth yet to be a greater demonſtration of Divine Power, for God to make the wrath of man to praiſe him, to bring forth the great deſigns of his glory out of mens ſins. It ſheweth us alſo the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom of God. The natural ſagacity of the bee is ſeen in ſucking honey out of poyſonous herbs and flowers, a thing of the ſweeteſt taſte out of flowers, and herbs of bittereſt taſte, and in doing it, it by its chymiſtry commendeth the wiſdom of its Maker, who hath given it this natural skill. The acquired art and skill of the <hi>Apothecary</hi> and <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> who make the deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt poyſons, which have the greateſt contrariety to humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſerve for medicines, to heal mens diſeaſes, commendeth the wiſdom of God; for their God hath taught them this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. But oh the wiſdom of God! to make our luſts, our wrath, our ſins to praiſe him! there muſt be ſomething of the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:192227:185"/>nature of honey in the herb or plant, or the bee could get none out of it; there muſt be ſomething in the poyſonous drug or plant, that is conſonant to the nature of man, or all the art of the Chymiſt and Apothecary could never make it ſerve for mans cure or healing. But there is nothing in the nature of ſin, but is quite oppoſite to the glory of God; yet God makes ſin to praiſe him. O the heighth and depth of Divine Wiſdom, yea and of Divine Goodneſs too! As there is nothing more oppoſite than ſin to Gods glory, ſo there is nothing more pernicious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to us: God makes our ſins to ſerve us, to excite habits of grace, <hi>repentance, faith, fear, watchfulneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. In the ſecond place, <hi>Learn from hence, how impoſſible it is, that a ſinner, by his rebellions againſt God, ſhould do any hurt but to his own ſoul.</hi> And this is enough to convince the moſt malicious ſinner, of the exceeding vanity of ſin. If <hi>Julian</hi> will in his rage throw his dagger up againſt Heaven, it ſhall not touch a ſtar, but return only upon his own head. If the Princes of <hi>Babylon</hi> will heat a fornace ſeven times hotter than ordinary, and open a Lyons den to deſtroy the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſervants of God; the fornace ſhall only burn up, and the Lyons devour themſelves. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in regard of the ſinſuneſs of the beſt of men, and Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſometimes to melt, and to try his people, the rage of ſinful men doth ſometimes reach them; but this is certain, it never reacheth Heaven, nor any of its counſels and deſigns, unleſs by the cry of it for vengeance againſt the ſinners. God will have his glory from the vileſt perſons, and their vileſt actions; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Aſſyria</hi> meaneth not ſo, yet he ſhall but accompliſh Gods pleaſure. In 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. you read a ſtory of the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> his ſending a party of Soldiers to take the Prophet, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. The Prophet, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, prayeth, that they might be ſmitten with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they were ſo, and then the Prophet leadeth them into <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> into the midſt of their Enemies. God deals thus with outragious ſinners. Their deſign is to diſhonour God, and to do God as much deſpight as they can: God ſmiteth them with blindneſs, and inſtead of accompliſhing of their ungodly deſigns, he getteth glory upon them: <hi>He diſappointeth the devices of the crafty; ſo as their hands cannot find their enterprize,</hi> Job 5.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Let me caution all, <hi>that they take heed, that they do not
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:192227:185"/>abuſe this notion, to give themſelves a liberty to ſin.</hi> Do not think this a ſufficient warrant for you to do any ſinful action, becauſe God knoweth how to make your ſins ſerviceable to his glory. This was an old corrupt concluſion, which the Apoſtle foreſaw, men would falſely draw from theſe premiſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.7. <hi>If the truth of God hath more abounded through my lye unto his glory, why then am I judged as a ſinner? and not rather, as we are ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reported, and as ſome affirm that we ſay, Let us do evil, that good may come upon it.</hi> So when the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. had ſaid, <hi>That as ſin had abounded, ſo grace ſhould much more abound;</hi> ſome concluded, that it was then beſt to continue in ſin, that grace might abound. Whom the Apoſtle anſwereth, as you will find, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1, 2, &amp;c. But that none may think, that from hence he is licenſed or incouraged to ſin, I beſeech you to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That God doth not move, or incite any to any ſinful action, nor command, nor approve any ſuch thing.</hi> God in fetching of his own glory out of mens ſins, doth but (if I may ſo ſpeak with reverence unto God) make the beſt of our bad markets. In the Epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Gaius,</hi> ver. 11, ſaith he, <hi>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good: he that doth good, is of God; but he that doth evil, hath not ſeen God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8. <hi>He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin, is of the devil: now for this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil.</hi> Sin is called the <hi>work of the fleſh; the fleſh,</hi> that is the mother of ſin, and <hi>the Devil,</hi> he is the <hi>father of ſin;</hi> the Devil ingendreth ſin upon our fleſh. So much of ſin as is in any man, ſo much there is in him of the fleſh, ſo much of the Devil; ſo much he is a ſervant to Satan, and to the fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, it is no <hi>thanks to the ſinner, that God hath any glory from his ſin;</hi> he is not active in the glorifying of God, his activity is all ſpent in the diſhonour of God: he is not <hi>voluntary</hi> in it. Sin doth not of its own nature glorifie God, there is nothing ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the glory of God as our ſin is. The ſinner doth not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intend the glory of God by his ſinful act. The ſinner in this caſe, is only a paſſive inſtrument of Gods glory; God fetcheth out his glory, forceth his glory from mens ſins. God is not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>den to the ſinner for any glory he getteth from his ſinful act. The glory which God hath from mens ſins, is as to the ſinner, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by accident, and beſides his intention; as much as it was beſides his intention, to let out an impoſthume, and cure his Enemy, who
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:192227:186"/>ran his ſword into him, with an intention to let out his life-blood.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider, that <hi>God needeth not our lye for his glory.</hi> Every ſin is a lye, and God out of our lies fetcheth out his glory; but he needeth them not, and therefore it is madneſs to ſay, I will ſin that God may be glorified. God can better bring forth his glory ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, he would be much more glorified by thy keeping his Commandments, and doing of his Will. God indeed needeth not our duties and beſt actions; but he much leſs needeth our luſts and corruptions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider, <hi>That though God in the wiſdom of his Providence, makes uſe of mens ſins, to fetch out his glory from them, yet he uſually takes vengeance upon the ſinner.</hi> It is the practice of the <hi>Politicians</hi> of the world, to make uſe of the treaſons of others, but ſeldom to reward the Traytors. It cannot be ſaid of God, that he ever loves or approves of the treaſon of ſin, but he ever puniſheth the Traytor without a true repentance.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, <hi>When God makes uſe of the ſins of people for his own glory, and for their good and ſalvation alſo</hi> (as in the caſe of thoſe which belong to his Election of grace), it is never done without a great deal of grief and ſorrow of heart to the ſinner: they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as through fire: great ſinnings muſt have great humiliation. He indeed ſometimes maketh uſe of his peoples ſins, to make them more humble, more watchful: but the ſinner firſt ſuffereth a great deal of loſs in the peace of his Spirit; he goes to heaven ordinarily with broken bones, and a bleeding heart. So that you ſee that Gods getting himſelf glory from his peoples ſin, gives no man a ground of preſumption, to go on in a courſe of ſin againſt God.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Let the remembrance of them <hi>cauſe you to walk ſoftly all the days of your life.</hi> This is that which God requireth of all, <hi>to walk humbly with their God.</hi> The remembrance of your ſins may be of notable uſe to you for this, to keep down that pride which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in all our hearts; that ſwelling in an opinion of our ſelves, of our own duties and performances; that uncharitable judging, and cenſuring, and triumphing over others, when we ſee them fallen in the day of temptations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Let the conſideration of how many ſins God hath forgiven you, make you <hi>love much.</hi> Thus the woman, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.37, 47 made an improvement, even of her former ſins; her <hi>much</hi> that was forgiven, ingaged her to love that God much, who had forgiven her ſo much. This improvement St. <hi>Paul</hi> made, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9, 10. <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the leaſt of all the Apoſtles, and not meet to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God. But by the grace of God, I am that I am, and his grace which was beſtowed on me, was not in vain: but I laboured more abundantly than they all.</hi> O this will be an excellent improvement, even of your ſins, if your former unholineſs ſhall now help to make you more holy, your former unrighteouſneſs ſhall help to make you more righteous for the time to come; your reflexions upon how much you have done againſt God, and his Saints, ſhall now engage you to do more for God, and the cauſe and people of God.

                  <p>I Am ſtill going on, inſtructing you to that ſpiritual Wiſdom, which the Text telleth you may be gained by, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Obſervation of the motions of <hi>Actual Providence.</hi> I am now proceeding to a Twelfth Obſervation of this nature, which I ſhall give you thus:</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 12. <hi>The Providence of God in the diſtribution of the good things of this life, doth in a great meaſure move circularly, though moſtly to the ſeeming advantage of ungodly men.</hi> In my enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this notion, I ſhall keep much to the ſame method which I obſerved in the former. 1. <hi>Opening it unto you.</hi> 2. <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the obſervation by inſtances.</hi> 3. <hi>Shewing you the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this motion of Divine Providence.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>Making ſome ſuitable Application.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. My obſervation (as you ſee) concerneth the motions of Actual Providence, as to its diſtribution of the portions of this life. The <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophers diſtributed all the good things they had any knowledg of into three ſorts. <hi>The good things of the body,</hi> amongſt which they reckoned, <hi>long-life, health, ſtrength, beauty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The good things of the mind</hi> the rich endowments of it, ſuch as <hi>knowledg, invention, judgment, wit, memory,</hi> and <hi>moral vertue,</hi> &amp;c. and the good things of <hi>fortune,</hi> ſuch as <hi>birth, ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous education, honours, riches.</hi> All theſe have a goodneſs in them, which lyeth in their ſuitableneſs to the uſe of humane life or ſociety. The blind Heathen, not ſeeing the fountain-head of theſe beautiful ſtreams, aſcribed them to fortune: But they are all in the hand of Providence, that giveth to one a longer, to another a ſhorter life; to one greater, to another leſſer meaſures of health
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:192227:187"/>and ſtrength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to one more judgment, wit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But I chiefly underſtand my Obſervation of the good things, which the Heathen called, <hi>Bona fortunae,</hi> the good things of fortune, ſuch as <hi>honours, riches,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe alſo are the Lords; he it is, ſaith <hi>Moſes, That gives us power to get wealth.</hi> And the Holy Ghoſt by another pen-man telleth us, <hi>That promotion cometh neither from the eaſt, nor from the weſt: but God pulleth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi> Promotion doth moſtly depend upon the favour of the great men of the Earth, and you ſhall obſerve the Scripture everywhere maketh God the Author of the favour and grace, which perſons have found in the eyes of the Princes of the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now I obſerve in the firſt place, <hi>That the wheel of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in making this diſtribution, doth for the moſt part move circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</hi> My meaning is, that good and evil of this nature, hath (as all humane things) its turns and viciſſitudes, ſometimes to good men, ſometimes to bad men. The Heathen had ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this, though what we call Providence, they aſcribed to <hi>fortune,</hi> to whom they gave a wheel, to ſignifie the rotation of all theſe ſublunary contentments, in which you know the ſame ſpokes are not always up nor down; but ſometimes theſe ſpokes are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, by and by they are at the ground; and thoſe that but now were below, are up in their place. And this is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in bodies of people, which are made up of thoſe two ſorts of men, that divide the world, <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>ungodly.</hi> There is a time when the <hi>vileſt</hi> are exalted, and <hi>the wicked walk on every ſide.</hi> This is <hi>their hour, and the power of darkneſs,</hi> as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.53. And there is a time again, <hi>When ten men ſhall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even ſhall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, ſaying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you,</hi> Zech. 8.23. There was a time when the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> proſpered in <hi>Egypt, Joſeph</hi> was advanced, and he was a protection to them. A while after the wheel turns, <hi>and there aroſe a King that knew not Joſeph,</hi> and then the <hi>Iſraeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> ſpoke in the wheel of Providence, was at the ground: but in a little while up it gets again. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with colours flying, and drums beating, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt were drowned in the red Sea. This was now <hi>their hour.</hi> But ſoon after the wheels turn again, and they are almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in the wilderneſs: But as ſoon as they were on the other
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:192227:188"/>ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> they were again in a proſperous ſtate. Soon after they were oppreſſed, firſt by one <hi>Pagan</hi> Adverſary, and then by another; but in <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> time, it was again an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion-time with them. And when they were in <hi>Canaan,</hi> that party of them, after <hi>Solomons</hi> time, which adhered to God, had their viciſſitudes; as they had good or bad Princes, ſo it fared with them. In the ſeventy years of the <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> Captivity, they had a very ſad time; but when that was out, they had again a kind hour: and in the very time of the <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> Captivity, they doubtleſs had great viciſſitudes; and the caſe was much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent with them, when the three Children were thrown into the fiery fornace, from what it was, when they were advanced to great honours: or when <hi>Daniel</hi> was thrown into the den of Lyons, from what it was, when he was made the firſt preſident. When they were come again into their own land, it was not above fifty years before <hi>Ahaſueroſh</hi> diſturbeth their ſettlement, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.6. After a few years more, they perfect the building, both of the Temple and City. Soon after they were oppreſſed, firſt by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> (when it was a very ſad time with them) then by the <hi>Romans,</hi> under whom they enjoyed more liberty, till after the crucifying of Chriſt, ſoon after which, God ſaid to them, <hi>Lo ammi, you are not my people.</hi> The like obſervation might be made of the Chriſtian Church-Catholick, and the ſeveral parts of it; <hi>God will not always chide, nor keep his anger for ever,</hi> Pſal. 103.9. <hi>The needy ſhall not always be forgotten,</hi> Pſal. 9.18. he hath ſaid, <hi>He will not contend for ever, neither will he be always wroth.</hi> The ſame obſervation might be made of <hi>particular perſons</hi> and <hi>parties fearing God. Jacob</hi> had his time of hard ſervice, and his time of liberty. <hi>Joſeph</hi> one while is a priſoner, another time the ſecond man in the Kingdom. <hi>David</hi> had a time, when he was <hi>hunted like a partridg on the mountains,</hi> and his time when he ruled hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily and peaceably over all <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of my Obſervation was, that as to theſe good things, the Actual Proridence of God, <hi>ordinarily moveth to the ſeeming advantage of wicked men:</hi> I ſay, <hi>ſeeming advantage</hi> upon a double account: 1. For firſt, <hi>Wicked men have no real advantage from any good things they have,</hi> their morſels are all dipt in wrath; and they turn to their real loſs and diſadvantage, as they draw out their luſts, and aggravate their eternal condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. 2. <hi>I much queſtion whether they have that ſeeming advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:192227:188"/>which they appear to have.</hi> If we conſider the diſproportion in the numbers of ſuch as fear the Lord, and ſuch as fear him not; I believe we ſhall find God, as to the things of this life, do as much for his people, as for wicked men. It is true, we ſee more wicked men than good men in places of honour and power; we ſee more of them, than of theſe proſper in the world, and grow great and rich: but therefore what diſproportion is there betwixt the number of the one, and of the other? But however, certain it is, that the ſervants of God have many of them found this a rock of offence to them, and have ſtumbled upon this temptation; ſo did <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 21. <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 73. <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 12.1. <hi>Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakuk,</hi> &amp;c. And this appearance hath been a temptation to others, to deny, or at leaſt to diſpute the Providence of God. I ſhall therefore give you a more particular account of this, when I come to open the <gap reason="foreign">

But truly upon a ſtricter obſervation, I believe we ſhall find Divine Providence, as to theſe things, more circular in its motions, and equal in its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributions, than we uſually judg it; being deceived, by not wiſtly obſerving the diſproportion of each party in its numbers; and that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.1, 2. will hold, <hi>that the love or hatred of God, is not to be judged from what doth in this life happen unto men.</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>the poor receive the Goſpel;</hi> ſo I ſhould rather tranſlate it, as in the paſſive voice, then as our tranſlation doth, as if it were the middle voice. <hi>The poor preach the Goſpel;</hi> and the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>That God hath choſen the poor of this world to be rich in grace, and heirs of the kingdom.</hi> And again, you know your calling brethren, <hi>not many rich, not many wiſe not many noble,</hi> &amp;c. yet the Providence of God doth deal out <hi>ſpecial grace</hi> to the rich, as well as to the poor. <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:192227:189"/>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> were all rich men; though as the number of the poor, far exceedeth the number of them who are poſſeſſors of great Eſtates; ſo the number of holy perſons of mean eſtates, bears the like diſproportion to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch perſons, that are great, and abound in this worlds goods; neither doth the Providence of God deal out theſe riches of ſpecial grace, as if they were inheritances. Was not <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> brethren? <hi>yet the Lord loved Jacob, and hated Eſau.</hi> You often in Scripture read of good men, that had very bad chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and of bad men, that had very good children: <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was a wicked man, one that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, yet in <hi>Abijam</hi> his ſon, there was <hi>ſome good thing found towards the Lord. Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jam</hi> the <hi>King of Judah,</hi> was a man that walked in all the ſins of his Fathers, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.2. Yet <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Aſa</hi> his ſon <hi>did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord. Jehoſhaphat,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Aſa,</hi> was a very good man; but <hi>Jehoram</hi> his ſon <hi>walked in all the ways of the Kings of Iſrael,</hi> 2 Chron. 21.5. ſo did <hi>Ahaziah</hi> his ſon. <hi>Jonathan</hi> was a good man, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27; but <hi>Ahaz</hi> his ſon <hi>walked in the ways of the Kings of Iſrael, and made images for Baalim;</hi> yet the ſon of <hi>Ahaz, Hezekiah,</hi> was an excellent man. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> his ſon was a very wicked man the greateſt part of his life: indeed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.13, 14, 15, being carried into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>bound in fetters,</hi> he beſought the Lord, and the Lord was intreated of him; and then the Scripture telleth us, <hi>That he knew the Lord was God,</hi> and he began ſomething of reformation, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>Ammon</hi> his ſon was a very wicked Prince, but <hi>Joſiah</hi> his ſon an excellent man; but we read no good of any one of his ſons. Thus as to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of ſaving-grace, we ſee the Providence of God is not to be tracked, ſometimes given to the ſon of a good father; at another time denied to the ſeed of thoſe in Covenant with God, and given out to the children of moſt vile and wicked parents: and this is no more than we yet ſee every day in the dealings of God. But it is time that I ſhould ſhew you the reaſonableneſs of theſe motions of Divine Providence. 1. <hi>Why the Providence of God moveth in ſuch a circular motion, in the diſtribution of the good things of this life.</hi> It will appear reaſonable to you,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you conſider both <hi>Gods general relation to all his creatures, and alſo his ſpecial kindneſs, and the demonſtration of it to his people, together with his faithfulneſs to his promiſes.</hi> 1. I ſay, <hi>his general relation to all his creatures:</hi> they are his creatures, he their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:192227:189"/>they by Creation his children, and he their father. It is true, they are undutiful children, and do not anſwer the law of their Creation; God may ſay to them, <hi>If I be your father, where is my honour?</hi> But yet children they are, God intends them not the inheritance, and therefore God doth by them, as <hi>Abraham</hi> by the children he had by <hi>Keturah,</hi> Gen. 25.5. <hi>To whom he gave portions, and ſent them away.</hi> A father hath many children, ſome elder, ſome younger, ſome more dutiful, whom he loveth with a more peculiar love; but he hath ſomething of a fatherly affection for them all, he giveth them all portions, more or leſs. Some have their <hi>portion in this life,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>Son remember,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives, thou hadſt thy good things in this life: thy good things.</hi> So <hi>Lazarus</hi> had a right to a childs portion. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent all his brethren a meſs, though to <hi>Benjamin</hi> he ſent ſeventimes as much as to the reſt. 2. But beſides this, ſome wicked men have another relation to God, as <hi>ſervants in ſome ſpecial ſervice,</hi> none of them are univerſally Gods ſervants; but in <hi>ſome ſpecial ſervice,</hi> many wicked men are Gods ſervants. And no man ſhall ſerve God for nothing. This was <hi>Jehu's</hi> caſe, which procured him the Crown for four generations, for the ſervice he did God againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab.</hi> Then if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, 1. <hi>Gods ſpecial kindneſs to his people,</hi> declared ſo often in Scripture, and the reaſonableneſs that God ſhould make ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of it, that all the world may know that God will honour thoſe that honour him; and how impoſſible it is, that the men of the world ſhould take notice of this, and be convinced of it meerly from ſpiritual rewards, of which they have no certain cogniſance, or from eternal rewards; you will ſee it but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that God in his Providence ſhould diſpoſe, even of the goods of this life, unto his own people, though not to all, yet to many of them, and that they ſhould have their turns in theſe diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of Providence, and not be always, or all of them poor and needy, or vile, and contemptible in the eyes of the world. Eſpecially ſeeing that, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Godlineſs hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as well of this life, as of that which is to come:</hi> And our Lord hath commanded us to <hi>ſeek the kingdom of heaven, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs thereof,</hi> upon the encouragement of a gracious promiſe, that the things of this life <hi>ſhall be added to them.</hi> Further, if there ſhould be no circulation of Providence in theſe diſtributions, how ſhould thoſe Scriptures be fulfilled? wherein God hath told
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:192227:190"/>us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5. <hi>That the rod of the wicked ſhall not always reſt upon the lot of the righteous; that he will take care that the ſpirits ſhould not fail before him, nor the ſouls that he hath made: that his anger endureth but for a moment; that ſorrow comes for a night, but joy ſhall come in the morning,</hi> &amp;c. And thoſe many other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for the good things of this life, which are made to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in Scripture, though they are not to be interpreted into an extent of that latitude, as if they ſhould be the conſtant portion of the Church and People of God, or of every child of God. Yet how ſhould they be made good, if there were not ſome circulation of Providence in the diſtribution of the good things of this life; if it ſhould not go ſometimes well, as well as ſometimes ill with the Church and People of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reaſonableneſs of this motion of Divine Providence will appear to you, from <hi>Gods love and zeal to Juſtice.</hi> Juſtice lyes in giving to every one their due; God muſt be juſt, and his Juſtice muſt be declared to the world, that all may know, that the God of Heaven is a righteous God. Now this Juſtice of God requireth ſuch a circulation of Providence, as I have commended to your obſervation. If you will but conſider, that as the whole life of wicked men is a life of rebellion and diſobedience: So God never had a Church in the world, nor any particular Saint, but had their corruptions, and were guilty of many miſcarriages, which ſubjected them to the vindicative Juſtice of God. Now for the People of God (if I may ſo ſpeak with holy Reverence) God hath tyed up his own hands, he cannot puniſh them with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal puniſhments, he hath accepted a price, a ſatisfaction for them; ſo as now, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus: But he hath a controverſie, even with Judah; and he muſt puniſh Jacob according to his ways, and according to his doings he muſt recompence him,</hi> Hoſ. 12.3. This can be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than by denying of them ſome good things in this life, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch ſpiritual enjoyments, as the denial of is yet conſiſtent with their enjoyment of the eternal inheritance, or thoſe things which concern the outward man. And as to wicked men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their greater puniſhment is reſerved unto another life; yet it is neceſſary for the vindication of <hi>Divine Juſtice before the world,</hi> that they ſhould in this life alſo have their portion of affliction and miſery: for as to <hi>ſpiritual judgments,</hi> they are but ſecret plagues, which the world taketh no notice of, nor doth it
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:192227:190"/>underſtand the bitterneſs and terribleneſs of them: and as to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal puniſhments, they, as well as the <hi>eternal rewards of the righteous,</hi> are matters of faith, and as not evidenced to the ſenſe of the living part of the world; ſo neither to be made ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable to their reaſon, as to inable the men of the world, from them alone, to conclude the Juſtice of God in recompencing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners according to their ways. So that upon this ſuppoſition, that the God of Heaven is a righteous God, that will recompence every one according to his ways, and that in the eyes of the world he will declare his Righteouſneſs: There muſt be in this life, both a reward, and a puniſhment for the People of God, and a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the wicked according to their ways; and conſequently ſuch a rotation and circulation of Actual Providence, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the good things of this life, as I have been diſcourſing to you. And this now gives you a reaſonable account of this motion.</p>
                  <p>If you further require of me to give you a reaſonable account, <hi>of the ſeeming inequality of the hand of Divine Providence, in theſe diſtributions,</hi> why it ſeemeth to give moſt advantage to evil men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place it is ſufficient to repeat to you, what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told you, that it is but a ſeeming advantage. The good things of this life are not in themſelves good or evil, but as they are uſed and improved. Indeed they are ſuch as of themſelves have a tendency to make men better; but they make men better or worſe, according to the hearts they meet with. Many a mans honours and riches prove his ruin here; but they prove to many more (through the corruption of their hearts) the occaſion of the eternal ruin of their ſouls, as they give them more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to exerciſe the luſts and corruptions of their hearts. As they are ſenſible portions, ſo it is but reaſonable, that the worſt of men ſhould have their portions of them; and through the predominancy of luſt and corruption in their hearts, they prove no advantages to them; but ſuch things as fat them up to the day of ſlaughter, and further prepare them for the Revelation of the righteous Judgments of God againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But, ſecondly, for <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>honours.</hi> The Providence of God doth ordinarily diſpenſe them out to men, <hi>according to their indeavours, and oft-times rather ſuffers men to get them, then gives them to them.</hi> Gods efficiency is indeed ſometimes
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:192227:191"/>diſcernable in giving men <hi>eſtates</hi> and <hi>honours,</hi> giving them favour in the ſight of Princes, raiſing them up great friends: but the moſt of men that come to great <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>honours,</hi> arrive at them, by being only ſuffered by God to walk and proſper in their own ways. And indeed this is one reaſon, why the way to theſe great things in the world, is more open to the Sinners, than to the Saints of the Earth. Our Saviour calleth riches, <hi>the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs;</hi> and although it poſſibly was too large to ſay, <hi>omnis Dives;</hi> yet it had been true enough to have ſaid, <hi>Plerun<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> Dives eſt vel iniquus vel iniqui haeres,</hi> great eſtates are at firſt gotten (uſually) by ill means, and are attainments, hardly fit for thoſe who think themſelves tyed up to the rule of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; being either got by undue ſparing, or unjuſt dealing. And the ſame might be ſaid of honours. Indeed it is not always ſo, ſometimes God throw's an eſtate into a mans lap, that is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of it, and heapeth honours upon ſome that ſeek not after it: and this may be one reaſon, why in theſe diſtributions the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in the diſtribution of theſe things, moveth more to the appearing advantage of wicked men, who can uſe any arts and means to make themſelves rich and great; than of thoſe who live by a ſtricter rule, and muſt refuſe gold offered them upon ſinful terms, and honours tendred them as a price for a proſtituted conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Experience teacheth us, <hi>That affliction and poverty, and a mean condition in the world, and a ſcant meaſure of the good things thereof, are moſt adequate to the exerciſes of grace, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of communion with God. Iſrael</hi> followeth God in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, in the land of droughts, and apoſtatizeth in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> When <hi>Jeſhurun waxeth fat, ſhe kicketh up the heel,</hi> like a fatted beaſt in the paſture, that while it was lean, was tame enough: and therefore <hi>Agur</hi> prays as much againſt exceſſive riches, as poverty. Now Gods whole deſign upon the Saints, is by his diſpenſations to them in this life, to fit them for the inheritance of the Saints in light; and what he gives them, ſhall be no more, than will accompany ſalvation, and fit them for it.</p>
                  <p>As to the third thing in my obſervation, who can give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the thing that is inaccountable? The reaſon of it lies in this: <hi>That God will have mercy, upon whom he will have mercy: and whom he will, he hardeneth.</hi> God will proclaim to the world, that his <hi>Grace</hi> is <hi>Grace,</hi> that is, free, not to be conveyed as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:192227:191"/>from the father to the child: not depending upon the merits of parents, nor annexed to any ſecular circumſtances, nor any thing, which in this world maketh one man to differ from another. But this is enough to give you ſome rational account of theſe motions of Divine Providence. I come now to the practical Application of what you have heard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. And in the firſt place this Obſervation will confirm us, <hi>That the love of God to mens immortal ſouls, is not to be determined from his diſpenſations of the good things of this life.</hi> In Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love, there is a certainty, in theſe things there is a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty. Theſe the Providence of God diſpoſeth in ſome kind of Circulation; ſometimes godly men have them, ſometimes wicked men, ſometimes the Church of God, ſometimes the Enemies of God. The Providence of God (as you have heard) in theſe things moveth moſt to the advantage of the vileſt men. But leaving this more general branch of Application, I ſhall apply it more particularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>To the ſinners of the world that proſper.</hi> The rod of God is not upon their backs, they are not plagued like other men: Gods Sun ſhineth upon their Tabernacles: their Bull gendreth, and faileth not; their-Cows calve, and caſt not their calves; they ſend forth their little ones like a flock, they take their Harps, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> are all with them. Three things I would take the advantage of this Obſervation to caution them againſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That they would not promiſe themſelves a perpetuity in this ſtate.</hi> As the child of God may ſay of his adverſity and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, theſe things are not <hi>Eternity;</hi> ſo the ſinner may ſay of his proſperity. There is a circulation in the motions of Providence in its diſtribution of theſe things: The ſame ſpokes of the wheel are not always uppermoſt; you are now ſpokes in the upper part, the wheel will turn, and you will be lower; moſt ſinners have their day, but it is but a day. Day and night, ſummer and winter, light and darkneſs follow one another in humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as well as in time: ſome have a ſummers-day, others a ſhorter winter-day, but none hath more than their hour or day. It was <hi>Babilon's</hi> error to ſay, <hi>That ſhe ſate like a Lady, and ſhould
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:192227:192"/>never ſee widowhood, or loſs of children.</hi> God tells her both theſe ſhould come upon her in one day. It is the weakneſs of humane nature to look upon any thing here as permanent. Are you therefore in a ſtate of proſperity? Is it your hour? think not you ſhall never be moved. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 30. ſaid in the day when his mountain ſtood ſtrong, <hi>That he ſhould never be moved.</hi> God did but <hi>hide his face, and he was troubled.</hi> You may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly meet with particular perſons, that are exceptions to this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, but hardly any body of people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let what you have heard <hi>admoniſh you not to glory and triumph in your proſperous ſtate;</hi> if you will rejoyce, let it be with <hi>trembling.</hi> The obſervation affords two reaſons why the <hi>proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſinner</hi> ſhould not exceſſively rejoyce. 1. <hi>Becauſe there is a circulation in theſe motions of Providence.</hi> This was that which quieted <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit, diſturbed at the proſperous ſtate of ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.18. <hi>Surely thou haſt ſet them in ſlippery places, thou caſtedſt them down into deſtruction.</hi> 2 I have told you that the <hi>Providence of God in theſe diſpenſations ſeemeth to incline moſt to favour the worſt of men. David,</hi> Pſal. 17.13, 14. prayeth to be delivered from <hi>wicked men, who have their portion in this life, and whoſe belly God filled with his hidden treaſure.</hi> It hath been an ordinary thing for good men to ſuſpect the love of God to them, when they have met with no changes. <hi>Luther</hi> was afraid God intended to put him off with the good things of this life. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I proteſted that I would not be ſo ſatisfied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, This ſpeaketh aloud to ſinners on the <hi>pinacles of the world, not to harden their hearts.</hi> Sin gives a man a baſe ſpirit, you ſhall ordinarily obſerve, that the worſt of men are moſt proud and haughty in their proſperity, and the moſt cowardly and low in their ſpirits, when an hour of adverſity comes. How ordinarily do we ſee it? If vile and abject men get a little power on their ſide, there is no living by them, their inſolencies, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and cruelties are ſo intolerable; but let them be a little under hatches, there's none will crouch ſo baſely. <hi>But, O you fools, when will you be wiſe?</hi> O that in their days of health, they would but think they may be ſick, when they are rich, that they may be poor; that when they are the head, they would conſider they may be the tail. Proſperity then would not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them: but it is true, which the Holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>That
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:192227:192"/>proſperity ſlayeth the fool.</hi> It ſeldom doth a child of God good. <hi>Before I was afflicted</hi> (ſaith holy <hi>David) I went aſtray;</hi> but it ordinarily <hi>ſlayeth the fool.</hi> I ſhall advantage this with this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſervation. As it is uſually obſerved, that men who have had a long and non-interrupted health, ſeldom eſcape the firſt acute ſickneſs they meet with. So it is very rare, that God entereth into judgment with a ſinner, that hath enjoyed a long proſperity, but he utterly conſumeth him; you cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in reading the Prophets, that as they denounced the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God againſt his own People; ſo they alſo denounced them againſt the Enemies of God, and with this remarkable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. They ſeldom threaten judgment to them, but it was <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruin;</hi> God would make a full <hi>end of them.</hi> But ſaith God, as to his own people, <hi>Thou ſhalt not go utterly unpuniſhed.</hi> I will make a full end of the Nations, that have carried thee away captive, <hi>but I will not make a full end of thee,</hi> Jer. 30.11, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, Let me turn my ſelf to them that <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> and improve my obſervation as to them in three or four words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Fret not then at the proſperous ſtate of wicked men.</hi> It is the great argument of the 37 <hi>Pſalm:</hi> where it is preſſed from a great variety of arguments. Remember that the motions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are circular. There are two ſorts of things that uſe mightily to affect us. 1. <hi>Strange and unuſual things.</hi> 2 <hi>Things which appear to us againſt reaſon.</hi> It is no ſtrange thing, <hi>Job</hi> 12.6. <hi>Job</hi> complained <hi>that the tabernacles of robbers proſpered, and they that provoked God were ſecure, the men into whoſe hands God bringeth abundantly.</hi> Diſturb not your ſelves then if you ſee men of prodigious wickedneſs great in power, and honour, and riches, and flouriſhing ('tis but what hath always been) and trampling under foot the people of the Lord. It is no new thing that happeneth to you. A ſecond ſort of things we uſually ſtartle at, are thoſe things which ſeem to us <hi>unreaſonable;</hi> we cannot reconcile them to our thoughts, and ſuch a thing is this proſperity of ſinners: but this fancy ſpeaketh only, 1. <hi>The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our faith.</hi> 2. <hi>And the ſhallowneſs of our reaſon.</hi> If we had faith but as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, that we could believe a life to come, and the joys of an eternal ſtate, in which theſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:192227:193"/>men ſhall have no portion; we ſhould not think theſe things of that value, but that God might reaſonably give them to wicked men. We are like ordinary people, that never were out of the Town where they live, or the Nation wherein they were born, that take that Town, or that Nation to be <hi>all the world,</hi> and think there is no place better than that which they ſee and live in. Did we believe that there is a more enduring ſubſtance? an houſe in the Heavens not made with hands, an inheritance that is immortal, incorruptible, that fadeth not away, to none of which the ungodly man hath any right at all, we ſhould never trouble our ſelves, that the Sun ſhineth a little upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of ungodly men: we ſhould think it but reaſonable, that God ſhould allow ſomething of the good things of this life to vile and profligate livers. Remember how the Father of the prodigal quieted the Son that had been always with him, troubled that his brother, who had devoured his living with Harlots, had the fatted calf killed for him, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.31. <hi>Son, remember thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</hi> The People of God, have God always with them, and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a daily communion with God; all the <hi>grace,</hi> all the <hi>glory of God</hi> is theirs. Think this reward enough for the cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy heart, and the waſhing of thy hands; and ſeeing the ſwearers and blaſphemers, and even the worſt men of the world, are Gods Creatures, and ſome of them (though they mean not ſo), yet do God ſervice ſometimes; do not judg it unreaſonable that God ſhould give them a portion in this life. But I forbear knowing, that it will fall in my way hereafter, when I ſhall come to open the hard Chapters of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to ſpeak more fully to the reaſonableneſs of this motion of Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This calleth unto the <hi>People of God, if at any time they be in a proſperous ſtate to look for an hour of adverſity.</hi> The Circulations of Divine Providence admoniſh Gods People of this; no man reaſonably ſaith in the morning, that the Sun ſhall ſet no more in his Horizon, nor in the Summer, that he ſhall never feel the cold, or ſee the ſtorms of another Winter; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the <hi>Ordinances of nature,</hi> and the Circulation of theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural motions. It is as unreaſonable to promiſe our ſelves ſtated and uninterrupted felicity in this life, to ſay (as <hi>David) In our
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:192227:193"/>proſperity I ſhall never be moved.</hi> Be rather thinking what you ſhall do, if God ſhould bring you into ſuch a condition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor do you <hi>deſpond in adverſity.</hi> Say to the Enemies of Church and Goſpel, as the Church in <hi>Micah, Mic.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Rejoyce not againſt me, O mine enemy; when I fall, I ſhall riſe; when I ſit in darkneſs, the Lord ſhall be a light unto me.</hi> It is as unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any to conclude at midnight, that there ſhall never be a morning, as in the morning to fancy there ſhall never be a midnight more: you have not it may be in this life thoſe full meaſures of the good things thereof, which others have; <hi>But,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>when I awake, I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs.</hi> Some interpret it of an awaking at the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> that is ſure enough. Some of an awaking out of his afflicted ſtate; God in this life is not always ſmiting, not always grieving the children of men. <hi>The rod of the wicked ſhall not always lye upon the back of the righteous.</hi> Do not build too much upon theſe hopes, remember that God hath better things for his people, than <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>honours,</hi> and <hi>earthly power.</hi> Heaven is their portion, but yet even as to this life, do not caſt away your hope.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But laſtly, <hi>Be patient under all the frowns of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> This is the method of Providence, the ſinner muſt have his hour, and that hour to the People of God will be the very <hi>power of darkneſs.</hi> The beaſts that are neareſt the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, uſually have the fatteſt paſtures; God hath far better things reſerved for them that love him, and even in this life: <hi>He will not leave you comfortleſs, he will come unto you;</hi> if not to the reſcue of your bodies, yet to the relief, ſupport, and ſatisfaction of your ſouls. <hi>Wherefore comfort your ſelves with theſe words.</hi>

                  <p>WE take notice in the world, that Wiſdom is not ſo much the daughter of <hi>ſtudy,</hi> as of <hi>experience.</hi> It is a practical habit, directing the ordering of mens converſations to their beſt advantage: which is not ſo well acquired from our poring on books, and making concluſions from <hi>connate principles,</hi> or <hi>maxims</hi> of others, as from the <hi>obſervation</hi> of what we ſee in the world. Hence we obſerve what <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 12.12. <hi>with the Auncients is wiſdom. Elihu</hi> ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 32.7. <hi>Days ſhall ſpeak, and multitude of years ſhall teach wiſdom.</hi> There muſt indeed be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a foundation in <hi>nature,</hi> and that is a good <hi>faculty of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and a <hi>foundation</hi> in art; for <hi>wiſdom</hi> dwelleth with <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> but neither <hi>nature,</hi> nor <hi>art</hi> and <hi>ſtudy</hi> will make a morally <hi>wiſe man.</hi> Obſervation contributes more than either: and this is the reaſon that wiſdom is with the <hi>Auncients,</hi> and that <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of years teacheth it.</hi> The reaſon of this is, the inequal diſtribution of <hi>reaſon</hi> to reaſonable creatures, and the prevalence of <hi>paſſion</hi> above it in the moſt of men; from this it is, that we can better conclude what is like to be done in the world, from what hath been done, than from any rational principles, which will tell us what one would think reaſonable men ſhould do. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Wiſdom likewiſe is much gained by <hi>obſervation:</hi> this is that which we call <hi>experience,</hi> by which we underſtand not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways what our ſelves have felt, but what we have ſeen with our eyes, what we have remarked in Gods dealings. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this, is <hi>our imperfect underſtanding of what God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his word,</hi> which lets us ſee, that we ſtand in need both of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of the <hi>Providence</hi> of God to be our interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:192227:194"/>and the <hi>oneneſs and immutability of God</hi> gives us a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantage to gain wiſdom from the iſſues of his Providence, then the variable paſſions of men will allow us to gain from what we ſee in their actings, whoſe methods oft-times vaſtly differ one from another; ſo as the policies of one age, have no cogna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thoſe of another. The reaſon alſo of which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a <hi>wheel within theſe wheels</hi> (though the fools and blind men of the world ſee it not) governing theſe ſenſible wheels, to the deſigns of his eternal counſels. Hence it is, that he <hi>who is wiſe, will obſerve;</hi> and he who <hi>would be wiſe,</hi> muſt obſerve the <hi>motions of Divine Providence;</hi> which though it hath many ſecret and unſearchable motions, yet alſo hath many certain and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form motions, which will fall under the ſcience and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſoul, that giveth up it ſelf to the ſtudy and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. I have already offered to you twelve Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the motions of Providence, I yet proceed, and ſhall at preſent offer you ſome further things chiefly relating to the motions of Divine Providence, in the executing of <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> and that as well in the <hi>rewarding</hi> of the <hi>righteous,</hi> as in the puniſhment of the ſinner; Two great works of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, about which indeed it is moſtly taken up: it goeth to and fro the world, doing this work every day; let us ſee how far we can track it, or make any judgment from the prints of its feet, where, or what we are like to meet with from it: meet it we muſt at every turn of our lives; our buſineſs is to make up a judgment, what we are like to meet with from it, whether it be like to ſay unto us, <hi>Haſt thou met me, O my friend!</hi> or as <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Elijah, Haſt thou met me, O mine enemy!</hi> The next Obſervation I ſhall commend to you, is this:</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 13. <hi>The reward of the righteous man, and alſo of the ſinner, is always certain and conſtant, though not always ſenſible and uniform?</hi> This muſt be true. <hi>Shall not the judg of all the earth do right?</hi> Gen. 18.25. It is in the nature of God to do juſtly, far ſooner ſhall a good tree bring forth corrupt fruit, than a righteous God do an unrighteous act. It is written in the Will and Promiſes of God, and in the threatnings which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Will of God againſt ſinners. <hi>Say ye to the righteous, that it ſhall be well with them, for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings: Wo unto the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, for the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:192227:195"/>reward of his hands ſhall be given him,</hi> Iſa. 3.9, 10. <hi>Though a ſinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged: yet ſurely it ſhall be well with them that fear God, that fear before him: But it ſhall not be well with the wicked, neither ſhall he prolong his days,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.12. But it may be better for your edification, that I ſhould open the Obſervation in the branches of it. The ſubject of my diſcourſe you ſee is the <hi>vindicative</hi> and <hi>remunerative Juſtice</hi> of God, conſidered as in the hand of Actual Providence, I ſay of both.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>it is certain,</hi> both the one and the other is certain; for the ſinner that ſwears and drinks, and wallows in his beaſtly luſts, that lies and cheats, and oppreſſeth, and breaks Sabbaths, that murthereth, and committeth adultery, and lives in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Commandments of God, his Judgment is certain, his damnation ſleepeth not; the Providence of God ſhall moſt certainly meet him, as a Bear robbed of her whelps, to tear him in pieces, and there ſhall be none to deliver. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for him that <hi>worketh righteouſneſs, that herein exerciſeth himſelf to keep a conſcience void of offence, both towards God, and towards men,</hi> that liveth an holy life and converſation, <hi>his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is certain.</hi> The certainty of both theſe depends, 1. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the immutable nature of God.</hi> The righteous God loveth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and hateth iniquity, he cannot <hi>clear the guilty;</hi> he cannot but reward the righteous; as ſoon ſhall God ceaſe to be God, as the <hi>perſiſting ſinner</hi> go unpuniſhed, or the perſevering Saint be unrewarded. 2. It dependeth upon the <hi>irrevocable will of God.</hi> God hath ſaid it, the Lord hath ſpoken it, and it ſhall come to paſs. Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, before a word ſhall fail of all which the mouth of the Lord has ſpoken. 3. It dependeth upon the <hi>faithfulneſs of Divine Providence, in acting conformably to the Divine Nature, in the execution of the Divine Counſels, and in purſute of the Divine Will.</hi> Providence is Gods action in time, God cannot act contrary to himſelf, nor contrary to his revealed Will. But this is what none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great impiety can ſo much as doubt. But I added,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That both the puniſhment of the ſinner, and the reward of the righteous man is conſtant.</hi> This is not now a matter of ſo ſenſible demonſtration, but equally true with the other, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.11. The holy Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>He judgeth the righteous, and is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the wicked every day.</hi> Anger in God ſignifieth nothing of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:192227:195"/>paſſion, as it doth in us. It only ſignifieth Gods <hi>juſt will</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſinners, and <hi>the execution of this his juſt will and pleaſure.</hi> Now I take that phraſe, <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> to be true in both ſenſes; not only that God hath an immutable will, purpoſe, and reſolution to puniſh reſolved and impenitent ſinners, but alſo that he is every day doing of it: and ſo he is every day rewarding the righteous man. But this will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear in my Explication of the third thing, where I told you,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That neither the reward of the one, nor the puniſhment of the other are uniform, or always ſenſible.</hi> And indeed the not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attending to this, is all that gives the leaſt advantage to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of <hi>Job, David, Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> concerning the proſperity of the wicked. <hi>God ſometimes puniſheth ſinners by temporary afflictions and judgments:</hi> theſe now are obvious to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eye, and incur into all mens ſenſes. All men take notice of mens being afflicted in their perſons, <hi>croſſed in their relations,</hi> in their <hi>eſtates,</hi> &amp;c. But thus God doth not always puniſh the worſt of men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath another <hi>way of puniſhing,</hi> and that more dreadful, that is, by <hi>ſpiritual judgments; ubi poenalis nutritur impunitas,</hi> a puniſhing them by ſuffering them to go unpuniſhed. God never more ſmartly threatned the ten Tribes, than when he told them by the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.14. <hi>I will not puniſh your daughters, when they commit whoredom, nor your ſpouſe when they commit adultery.</hi> He never ſpake more ſeverely, than when he ſaid, <hi>Why ſhould they be ſmitten any more, they will revolt more and more,</hi> Iſa. 1.5. Hence impenitency, hardneſs of heart: hence they bleſs themſelves in their ſinful courſes: this makes them ſhut their eyes, and ſtop their ears. This is indeed an inſenſible judgment; but as it is with the wounds of the body, the more ſecret they are, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the worſe they are: ſo it is with judgments upon a man, the more inward and inſenſible, the more deſperate and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is the caſe. The giving of ſinners up to a <hi>blindneſs of mind,</hi> (as in the caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites), Iſa.</hi> 6.9. to an <hi>hardneſs of heart</hi> (as in the caſe of <hi>Pharaoh), Exod.</hi> 4.21. <hi>to vile affections,</hi> (as in the caſe of the <hi>Heathen), Rom.</hi> 1.26. to a <hi>reprobate mind,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are of all other the greateſt puniſhment, one or other way God is angry with the wicked every day. Although he is not every day plaguing them with ſenſible judgments; yet
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:192227:196"/>when he is not doing this, he is <hi>letting them alone</hi> (as God ſpake concerning <hi>Ephraim, Ephraim</hi> is joyned to <hi>idols, let him alone</hi>) ſuffering them to go on in their own ways, by which means their hearts grow more <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>impenitent,</hi> more <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> and this is the reaſon that <hi>wicked men grow worſe and worſe,</hi> more vile in their affections, more ſottiſh and reprobate in their minds and judgments, more vile and abominable in their lives. And as the puniſhment of the ſinner, ſo the reward of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, though it be always certain and conſtant, yet it is not <hi>uniform,</hi> nor always <hi>ſenſible,</hi> eſpecially to others. The certainty of their reward ſtandeth upon the very ſame foundations, that the certainty of the ſinners puniſhment doth, and ſo doth the <hi>conſtancy</hi> of it: for as God is <hi>angry with the wicked every day,</hi> ſo God is well-pleaſed with the righteous every day; he can every day go to God, and ſay unto him, <hi>Thou art my father;</hi> God is every day well-pleaſed with him, and delighted in him. But I ſay, theſe <hi>rewards</hi> are not always uniform, our heavenly Father hath more than one bleſſing; ſometimes he bleſſeth him that worketh righteouſneſs after one manner, ſometimes after another, but he always bleſſeth them. Let me a little open to you the plenty of bleſſings, which our heavenly Father hath, and ſhew you how variouſly he rewardeth him that worketh righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes <hi>ſome of his people ſhall be bleſſed with outward bleſſings. Abraham</hi> ſhall be a rich man, and have many flocks and herds. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhall be the ſecond man in <hi>Egypt. David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhall be great Princes. <hi>Mordecay</hi> ſhall be the man whom the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſhall delight to honour. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhall be the firſt preſident. This is neceſſary that God may juſtifie his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of this nature: you have ſuch, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128.1, 2, 3. and in many other Texts of holy Writ. They may be neceſſary to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the intereſt of God in the world. The world muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſay, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous.</hi> Gods own people ſhall ſometimes have healthy bodies, numerous families, plentiful comfort in their relations; many left hand-mercies, added to thoſe <hi>ſpiritual bleſſings,</hi> with which God hath bleſſed them all in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others now God doth not reward this way, <hi>but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth them in their ſouls and inward man:</hi> and indeed this is the conſtant reward of them that fear the Lord: and there is a variety in theſe too. God doth not meaſure out the ſame kinds,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:192227:196"/>nor the ſame proportions unto all. Some are bleſſed with a quiet conſcience, poſſibly they have not extaſies of joy as others, but their hearts do not condemn them: and this is indeed the uſual reward of the man that worketh righteouſneſs: <hi>The work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace</hi> (ſaith the Prophet), <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.17. If God brings them to a ſick-bed, or into any other ſtrait, they can ſay with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.3. <hi>I beſeech thee, O Lord, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart,</hi> that is, an upright ſincere heart; or with <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Remember me, O Lord, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds which I have done for the houſe of my God.</hi> And give me leave to tell you, this is a great reward, but to be delivered from the ſowre reflexions of a condemning conſcience: for as there is nothing more nauſeous and troubleſom to us, than the ſower recoilings of our ſtomack; ſo there is no greater torment to a mans life, than the recoilings of a guilty conſcience. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is oft-times ſo great a torture to a ſinner as this, when he ſaith unto his conſcience, <hi>Is it peace?</hi> and his conſcience tells him, <hi>What peace?</hi> ſo long as thy drunkenneſs, thy whoredoms, thy lyes, and oaths and blaſphemies, thy cheating and cozening, thy oppreſſion and violence remain? <hi>There is no peace to the wicked</hi> (ſaith my God). On the other ſide there is nothing ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing unto a ſpirit tired with the croſneſs of the world, than to find a peace within himſelf. Now this is the general reward of the righteous man, if he miſſeth raptures and extaſies of joy; yet he cometh not ſhort ordinarily of a quiet and ſerenity of a waky and awakened conſcience. I know there are hours of melancholy, and darkneſs, and deſertion, to which the beſt of Gods People are expoſed; but theſe are but rare examples in compariſon of thoſe multitudes of godly ones, that walk in ſome bleſſed view of their own ſincerity and uprightneſs. Some he <hi>rewardeth in their inward man, with raptures and extaſies of God: They know and are perſwaded that nothing ſhall ſeparate them from the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> they defie death and hell, and challenge the fatal ſtrokes which others tremble at the thoughts of. They complain of time, and were it not for the Law of God in the caſe, would diſmiſs their ſouls of their priſon, and lye (like men waiting for a wind) longing for that happy gale, that ſhould carry their ſouls into the wide Sea of Eternity. But this is but the portion of a few, and ſcarce the abiding temper of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:192227:197"/>them neither; but ſuch hours the People of God have had. Some again he rewardeth <hi>inwardly</hi> with <hi>ſtrength,</hi> confirmed habits of grace, and contentment with their portion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their outward man decreaſeth, but their inward man increaſeth day by day: they are poor in purſe, but rich in grace; they have but little, but they are content with what they have, and tell all the world they have enough. And let me tell you, that as puniſhments in the inward man, are the greateſt puniſhments; ſo theſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual rewards are of all other the greateſt rewards, which is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of eaſie demonſtration, if we will but allow our ſouls to be our nobler parts, and the Jewel to be better than the <hi>Cabinet.</hi> Whatſoever tends to the debaſing and ruining the ſoul, muſt be the greateſt evil; and whatſoever conduceth to its ennobling or felicity, muſt be the greateſt reward and good. Beſides this, ſpiritual judgments are the continual forerunners of ſuch as are temporal, and ſpiritual mercies draw after them, at leaſt a proportion and ſufficiency of the good things of this life. <hi>All theſe things ſhall be added unto you</hi> (ſaith our Saviour). 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.16. God ſent a Prophet unto <hi>Amaziah,</hi> the King would not hear him; ſee what the Prophet ſaith, <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>that God hath determined to deſtroy thee: why? becauſe thou haſt done this, and haſt not hearkned unto my counſel:</hi> Spiritual judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments forerun temporal, you have it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10. When the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet asked how long? how long in ſeeing, they ſhould ſee, and not perceive; and hearing they ſhould hear, and not underſtand? God anſwereth, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the cities be waſted without an inhabitant, and the houſes ſhould be left without men, and the land ſhould be utterly deſolate.</hi> In like manner ſpiritual rewards and mercies never go without ſomething of this life, if not a plenty, yet a ſufficiency, food convenient for Gods People. Finally, as <hi>ſpiritual judgments</hi> are the forerunners of eternal ruin: ſo ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are the more certain forerunners of eternal ſalvation; they are the things which (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>accompany ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and make men <hi>meet for the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But God ſometimes <hi>rewards his people with ſufferings.</hi> This you may think a ſtrange reward. But yet a reward it is, Chriſt promiſeth to the loſers for him, that they ſhould receive <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, houſes, lands,</hi> with <hi>perſecutions;</hi> and the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. <hi>rejoyced they were thought worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his name-ſake.</hi> God honoureth that man whom he calleth out to be a witneſs
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:192227:197"/>for him, and to carry his croſs after him. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh of other afflictions, and cryeth out, <hi>Job</hi> 7.17. <hi>Lord, what is man that thou ſhouldſt magnifie him? that thou ſhouldſt ſet thine heart upon him? that thou ſhouldſt viſit him every morning, and try him every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> What need we more than what the Apoſtle aſſureth us? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>That whom the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every child whom he receiveth: Our light and momentany afflictions</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall work for us a far more eternal and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weight of glory: and if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified together with him,</hi> Rom. 1.17. This variety of rewards our heavenly Father hath. The rewards of the righteous from God are not uniform, but always certain and conſtant: one way or other, Gods Providence is always doing them good, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding their righteous deeds: and this muſt neceſſarily be true upon the Apoſtles <hi>Hypotheſis, That all things ſhall work together for the good of them that love God.</hi> But I haſten to the Application.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. In the firſt place let me recommend this to your obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Though there be ſuch a vaſt difference between good and evil in their own intrinſick natures, as might juſtly allure us into the embraces of the former, and ſcare every man from the purſuit of the latter; yet ſuch is our nature, that we ſtand in need of encouragements to the former by rewards, and by the terrors of the Lord to be ſcared from the latter; and there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any thing more effectual with us to diſcourage ſin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage goodneſs, than if we can effectually perſwade our ſelves, that the puniſhment of ſin is both <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>conſtant,</hi> and the <hi>reward of righteouſneſs</hi> is ſo alſo. This is the point I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to demonſtrate, and you have heard that the reaſon of any ones preſumption of the contrary, is their looking at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as a <hi>puniſhment</hi> or a <hi>reward</hi> but what is ſenſible, than which we cannot be guilty of a greater miſtake, nor any of worſer conſequence, as to the malign influence it will have upon our lives, and (conſequently) upon our eternal ſtate. But conſider what hath been ſaid, and judg whether a man can do any thing to the greater ruin of himſelf, than to go on in an impenitent and reſolved courſe of ſinning againſt God. Poſſibly you do obſerve, that as to outward things it is much one with a profane ſwearer and blaſphemer, as with the man that reverenceth the glorious God, and feareth an oath, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. with the drunkard, as
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:192227:198"/>with him that is ſober; with the chaſt, as with the unclean; with the Sabbath-breaker, as with him that <hi>remembers to keep holy Gods day;</hi> nay the profane lawleſs ſinner is in greater honour and power than the other, richer than the other: and this incourageth thee to joyn with them. But poor creature! hath he that hath many bleſſings, but one curſe, think'ſt thou? Obſerve well that ſame proſperous ſinner, and tell me if <hi>every day</hi> he doth not grow worſe, if <hi>according to his paſtures,</hi> he be not filled with all the fruits of unrighteouſneſs, if he be not given up to a <hi>blind mind,</hi> an hard heart, vile affections, if thou doeſt not obſerve that his conſcience is ſeared, and branded with an hot iron, as it were, that he grows paſt feeling. If thou ſeeſt this, ſay not <hi>he is not puniſhed,</hi> he is puniſhed with a witneſs. Is a ſealing up to damnation no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? According to our law you know malefactors are firſt ſeared with an hot-iron, upon their next miſcarriage they are hanged. It is Gods method, when once a ſoul is ſeared with an hot-iron, given up to be <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> to damn him next without mercy. Look well upon the ſinner, and thou wilt diſcern God is angry every day with him, he is every day fitting for Hell flames, Is this no puniſhment? On the other ſide <hi>thou ſeeſt the man according to Gods heart,</hi> walking ſadly; he is plagued every night, chaſtned every morning, he is poor and needy, hungry and thirſty, in priſons, in deaths often, purſued by the falcons of the world, as a partridg upon the mountains, perſecuted on all hands. Thou concludeſt contrary to the Scripture, <hi>That he hath waſhed his hands in vain, and cleanſed his ſoul to no purpoſe: verily there is no reward for the righteous.</hi> But harken poor creature. Had <hi>Eſau's</hi> Father many bleſſings? and hath <hi>Jacob's</hi> God but one ſort? Thou ſeeſt his poverty and want, but doeſt thou ſee how he hath learned in all eſtates to be content, and hath changed his name into a <hi>quod vult Deus.</hi> And certainly <hi>godlineſs with contentment is great gain.</hi> A poor contented <hi>Lazarus,</hi> is an happier and richer man, than a diſcontented covetous <hi>Dives.</hi> Thou ſeeſt how he is afflicted every day, how full of troubles his life is; but thou doeſt not ſee the ſerenity of his ſpirit, the peace of his conſcience: his joy in the Holy Ghoſt, his glorying and rejoycing in tribulations, as his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations work patience, his patience experience, and his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hope. Mark, ſirs, the <hi>upright men, conſider the juſt men,</hi> you will ſee their ends to be peace; yea in this life you will ſee them more indiſturbed by troubles, and inconcerned in the ruffles
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:192227:198"/>of the world than other men. The more you obſerve, the more you will be confirmed in this truth, that the Providence of God will certainly reward, yea is conſtantly rewarding him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. But ſecondly, what a <hi>trembling</hi> and <hi>terror</hi> ſhould this Obſervation <hi>ſtrike into the loins of every ſinner; what an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould it lay upon them to repent, and turn from the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their way.!</hi> Each part of this Obſervation ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for this purpoſe. Impunity in ſinning, is a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the ſinner: the heart of man ſtands bent to his luſts, and if he fancieth that he may eſcape the hands of Divine Juſtice, or that he doth eſcape, and thrive, and proſper in his wicked courſes, it wonderfully imboldneth him to go on; but if the vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him be certain, if his iniquity will certainly find him out, that he may as well hope not to dye, as not to be thrown into Hell when he dyes; and if the wrath of God be already kindled againſt him, and God be already puniſhing him, What hope? what incouragement can he then have? Now this you have heard is the ſinners caſe. I remember when that great plague was began amongſt the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> upon their murmuring againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> after the death of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram, Numb.</hi> 16.46. <hi>Moſes</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Aaron take a cenſer, and put fire therein from the Altar, and put incenſe thereon, and go quickly to the congregation</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the Lord, the plague is begun.</hi> Is here an impenitent ſinner before the Lord? one that hath been a <hi>drunkard,</hi> a <hi>ſwearer,</hi> a <hi>profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or that hath lived without God in the world, that bleſſeth himſelf with vain hopes or preſumptions, that he ſhall eſcape the Judgment of God, or may eſcape it; that his ſoul is at preſent free from fears, he thriveth, he proſpereth in the world, and his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity blindeth his eyes, that he cannot ſee the hell into which he is dropping, and ſo maketh no haſte to deliver himſelf from the wrath that is to come? To ſuch a one let me ſpeak, (oh that my counſel might be acceptable!) <hi>take thy cenſer, put fire thereon from the Altar, and put on incenſe, and go quickly, and make an atonement for thy ſoul.</hi> Theſe are indeed things not in thy power, but my meaning is, Betake thy ſelf quickly to the great work of repentance, which lyes not ſo much in tears and humiliation, as in the change of thy heart, in thy turning from the wickedneſs of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:192227:199"/>thy way, breaking off from thy ſinful courſes. Betake thy ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is he who hath the <hi>golden cenſer, to whom is given much incenſe,</hi> Rev. 8.3. It is he, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. <hi>By whom we muſt receive the atonement.</hi> Whatever you may think, <hi>wrath is gone forth againſt you,</hi> the plague in your ſouls is begun: you are in health, not ſick, not in pain as other men; not ſo croſſed in your eſtates and relations, as ſome other men; but for all this wrath may be gone forth againſt you, the plague may be begun within you. Let me examine you a little, do not you find that your mind is more blind, your underſtanding more dark, your affections more vile and ſenſual, your conſciences are more benummed and ſtupid? Is not the plague then began? Can there be more dreadful indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Divine Wrath againſt you? The ax is laid to the <hi>very root of your tree;</hi> if you do not now bring forth better fruit, you will ſuddenly be cut down and caſt into hell-fire.</p>
                  <p>Again, What an incouragement to repentance is it, to hear, <hi>That he who worketh righteouſneſs, ſhall moſt certainly be rewarded,</hi> yea that he is rewarded every day? Thou that liveſt and goeſt on in a courſe of bold and preſumptuous ſinning, what peace haſt thou when thou lyeſt down, or when thou riſeſt up? Art not thou like a bankrupt in the world, or one who is much behind-hand, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to look into his books? no more canſt thou endure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy conſcience, or to call thy ſelf to an account; it may be thou haſt <hi>quietem ex ſomno,</hi> ſuch a quiet as a man in a dead ſleep hath. The man that worketh righteouſneſs, can call himſelf often to account, and when he hath done, lye down and ſleep in peace, either in a full aſſurance, or a good hope, at leaſt through grace, that God hath pardoned and accepted him. Let therefore my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel this day be acceptable unto you, <hi>break up the fallow-grounds of your hearts, ſow unto your ſelves in righteouſneſs, believe that the work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace, and the effect thereof quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Finally, <hi>What an encouragement here is to the people of God under all Gods ſevere diſpenſations to them, to go on doing good.</hi> Do not deſame the God of Heaven, with ſaying or thinking that you <hi>cleanſe your hands in vain,</hi> nor that he taketh a long day to reward them that work in his work. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith our Lord) <hi>I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every one according as his work ſhall be.</hi> It will not be long before Chriſt will come
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:192227:199"/>with this great reward; but as he puniſheth the wicked, ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth alſo the righteous man every day: it may be he doth not reward thee with a <hi>long life,</hi> an <hi>healthful body, a plentiful eſtate,</hi> other accomodations of this life; his wiſdom ſeeth not theſe things fit for thee, he knoweth thy heart, thy temper; but haſt thou not a quiet conſcience, a ſerenity of mind? or art thou not <hi>ſtrengthened with might in the inward man? doth not Chriſt dwell in thy heart by faith? art thou not rooted and grounded in love, and able in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and heighth, and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledg, that thou mayeſt be filled with all the fulneſs of God? Thou art</hi> (it may be) <hi>troubled on every ſide, but art thou diſtreſſed?</hi> thou art <hi>perplexed,</hi> but art thou in <hi>deſpair?</hi> thou art <hi>perſecuted,</hi> but art thou <hi>forſaken?</hi> thou art <hi>caſt down,</hi> but art thou <hi>deſtroyed?</hi> Thou beareſt about in thy body, <hi>the dying of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that the life alſo of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in thy body,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.9, 10. Is this no reward? It may be it is not the reward thou lookedſt for, but it is that reward which God ſeeth fitteſt for thee. It is not all that thou ſhalt have, when he ſhall come, whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is with him (and he telleth thee that will be quickly), thou mayeſt expect fuller and greater things; in the mean time thou haſt a <hi>viaticum,</hi> an enough for thy paſſage through the wilderneſs. The work of God is a wages to it ſelf, but God gives thee wages beſides; yea, and <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor hath ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive, What great things God hath further prepared for them that love him;</hi> ſay not then, <hi>that thou ſerveſt God for nothing, and faint not, nor be weary of well-doing: for you ſhall reap if you faint not.</hi>

                  <p>THe <hi>theſe things</hi> mentioned in the Text (as I have formerly told you, and you may eaſily aſſure your ſelves from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the <hi>Pſalm),</hi> are the great and various motions of <hi>Actual Providence,</hi> concerning which, I am recommending to you divers things that I conceive as true, ſo very obſervable. Thirteen I have diſcourſed, I proceed to another, which will alſo concern the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Actual Providence, in the diſtribution of rewards and puniſhments. The Obſervation is this:</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 14. <hi>The Providence of God doth ſometimes reward the intentions of his people, where he doth not allow of, and approve, the actions which ſhould be the product of thoſe intentions; and very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reward ſome actions, from which he hath ſervice, where he by no means allows the agents deſign and intention.</hi> In the handling of which, I ſhall firſt juſtifie the Obſervation by inſtances. Secondly, I ſhall ſhew you <hi>the reaſonableneſs of this motion of Providence.</hi> And laſtly, I ſhall <hi>make ſome Application of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay firſt, <hi>The Actual Providence of God doth ſometimes allow of, approve, and reward the general good intentions of his people; when yet he doth not, and will not allow of thoſe actions, which ſhould be the product of ſuch deſigns and intentions.</hi> This evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in that famous inſtance of <hi>David,</hi> recorded in holy Writ, both in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. and in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. The ſtory is this: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> life until that time, had been a life of a great deal of trouble and diſtraction; he had many Enemies both before and after he came to the Throne; but at length <hi>God</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>had given him reſt round about from all his enemies.</hi> The good man
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:192227:200"/>preſently begins now to think what eminent ſervice he ſhould do for God. At length he conſiders, that there was no publick place for the Worſhip of God, nothing but a Tabernacle; he had built himſelf a fine houſe of Cedar, but the ark, the ſymbol of Gods Preſence with his People, that dwelt in <hi>Curtains</hi> (as he expreſſeth it, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.) But this being a thing which concerned the Worſhip of God, as to which above all things <hi>the Lord our God is a jealous God; David,</hi> though a great Prince, a great Prophet, a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods own heart, would do nothing till he had adviſed with the Prophet <hi>Nathan: Nathan bids him to go, and to do all that was in his heart; for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Lord is with thee.</hi> The good man was but a man, and was miſtaken; God did not allow of the action,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe he had not directed as yet any ſuch thing,</hi> ver. 7. In all the places <hi>wherein I have walked</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the children of Iſrael, ſpake I a word with any of the tribes of Iſrael</hi> [or Judges of <hi>Iſrael] whom I commanded to feed my people Iſrael, ſaying, Why build you not me an houſe of Cedar:</hi> he repeateth the ſame reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.6. Indeed there is another reaſon given, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.8. <hi>Thou haſt ſhed blood abundantly, and haſt made great wars: thou ſhalt not build an houſe to my name, becauſe thou haſt ſhed much blood upon the earth in my ſight.</hi> So 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.3. For thoſe two reaſons God diſapproved the action, and reſerved it for <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſon, then it became an inſtitution: <hi>Solomon</hi> might lawfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, and did do it. But yet you ſhall find, that God emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently rewarded this good intention and purpoſe of <hi>Davids</hi> heart, as you ſhall read at large, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. and to that degree, that <hi>David,</hi> ver. 18. thought himſelf obliged to offer up unto God a particular <hi>ſacrifice of thanksgiving,</hi> and to offer up thoſe praiſes to God, which you ſhall read at large in that Chapter, from the 18th verſe, to the end of the Chapter. It is plain, that God only rewarded his general purpoſe, and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; for the act or iſſue of that intention and purpoſe, the Lord accepted not, but accepted his <hi>good will</hi> for the deed, which he rejected. For an inſtance on the other ſide, take <hi>Jehu. Jehu</hi> did a <hi>good act,</hi> that is, the thing which God commanded him: he indeed did it poſſibly in an ill manner, with ill circumſtances, which cauſed God to threaten, that he would avenge the blood of <hi>Jez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel</hi> upon the houſe of <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.7. When the Prophet anointed him that was his Commiſſion, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſmite the houſe
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:192227:201"/>of Ahab thy maſter, that I may avenge the blood of my ſervants the Prophets, and the blood of all the righteous ſervants of the Lord at the hand of Jezebel;</hi> when it was done, God rewarded him for it, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.30. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>thou haſt done well in my eyes, in executing that which is right in mine eyes; and haſt done unto the houſe of Ahab, according to all that was in mine heart, thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the fourth generation ſhall ſit on the throne of Iſrael.</hi> But yet <hi>Jehu</hi>'s deſign and intention in all this was naught, he intended no more than to make himſelf King; he pretended indeed a zeal for the Lord, but intended nothing but the advancement of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his family; for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. of that 10th Chapter, <hi>That Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Iſrael with all his heart, for he departed not from the ſins of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam, which made Iſrael to ſin.</hi> God here rewarded the action done at his command, and in the execution of his will, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the intentions and deſigns that were in <hi>Jehu's</hi> heart upon the undertaking and performance of it. Take another inſtance, it is that which I have formerly inſiſted upon in the 10th of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> v. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It is plain that God approved of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi>'s actions againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he calls them the <hi>rod of his anger,</hi> ver. 5. he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>That he would ſend him againſt an hypocritical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and againſt the people of his wrath he would give him a charge, to take the ſpoil, and take the prey, and to tread them down like mire in the ſtreets: Howbeit,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo; but it is in his heart to deſtroy, and cut off nations not a few.</hi> The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> had nothing but ſinful intentions, he aimed at nothing but <hi>ſpoil</hi> and <hi>plunder,</hi> and accordingly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Gods Will; upon which, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. God threatneth, <hi>That when he had performed his whole work upon Mount Zion, and upon Hieruſalem, he would puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of Aſſyria, and the glory of all his looks:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>That he would ſend amongſt his ſtrong ones leanneſs, and under his glory kindle a burning, the burning of a fire.</hi> More inſtances might be given of either ſort, but theſe are enough. Let me proceed in ſhewing you the reaſonableneſs of Divine Providence in theſe motions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. On the part of wicked men, it is but reaſonable; <hi>Becauſe in ſuch actions they do God ſervice, and it is not reaſonable they ſhould ſerve God for nothing.</hi> You have a remarkable text for this, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.18, 19. <hi>Son of man</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Ezekiel), Nebuchadnezzar
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:192227:201"/>King of Babilon cauſed his army to ſerve a great ſervice againſt Tyrus, every head was made bald, and every ſhoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army for Tyrus, for the ſervice that he ſerved againſt it. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, behold I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadnezzar King of Babilon, and he ſhall take her multitude, and take her ſpoil, and take her prey, and it ſhall be the wages for his army: I have given him the land of Egypt for the labour wherewith he ſerved againſt it, becauſe they wrought for me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> The King of <hi>Babilon</hi> never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally wrought for God, undoubtedly what the Lord ſaid of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> was applicable to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babilon;</hi> ſpoil, and plunder, and dominion, was all which he aimed at, he never intended to work for God: but yet the work was what was Gods Will ſhould be done, and what God had incited him to do; <hi>he wrought for me</hi> (ſaith God) he did ſervice, and a great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he hath had no wages for it, none ſhall work for me and be unpaid, I will give him the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> for his pay. So <hi>Jehu,</hi> he wrought for God, and did a great ſervice againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab; I will pay him,</hi> ſaith God. <hi>Jehu</hi> ſhall never ſay he wrought for nothing, his ſons ſhall ſit upon the Throne to the fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Nay upon this account oft-times God rewardeth wicked men for ſome actions, and afterwards puniſheth them for the manner of their doing of thoſe actions; it is poſſible men may do what God commandeth them, and yet not obey God. God may reward men for their action, as it is a ſervice to him, and yet puniſh them for their ill-doing of the action.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. On the part of good men, where God rewardeth the good deſign, intention, and purpoſe, whiles yet he diſalloweth the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the motion of Providence ſeemeth yet more reaſonable; if we but conſider, <hi>that it is the heart which God principally requires, looketh at, and accepteth.</hi> And where the heart is right, the miſtake in the action can be but a lapſe of humane frailty and weakneſs. Now where the ſincere purpoſe and deſign, and counſel of the heart is right, there the heart muſt be right with God. I ſay the heart is that which God requireth, <hi>My ſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>give me thy heart,</hi> and you ſhall find where that is right bent and inclined. God paſſeth over a great many errors and failings in the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and this is what God ſaid in this very caſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Whereas it was in thine heart to build me an houſe, thou didſt well that it was in thine heart.</hi> The Lord <hi>looketh on the heart,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:192227:202"/>in Scripture he accounteth men to have done good or evil, according as their hearts were <hi>prepared</hi> or <hi>ſet. Rohoboam did evil, becauſe he prepared not his heart to ſeek the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 12.14. Now where there is a good intention, deſign, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, there the heart is right. Only here I muſt caution you as to two things: 1. <hi>That you do not think that a pretence of a good heart or intention will do you any ſervice.</hi> It is one thing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a good heart, another thing to have it. <hi>Jehu</hi> pretended a <hi>great zeal for God,</hi> but had nothing leſs. 2. You muſt take heed of thinking, that a good intention will juſtifie a <hi>ſinful action;</hi> but a <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>good intention,</hi> I ſay is accepted of God, and often rewarded by him, where the action is ſuch as God approveth not, and makes an error in action to be but a ſin of infirmity; for where the heart ſtands right, and truly deſigns the honour of God, the man cannot in that action wilfully diſhonour God: and this is enough to make this motion of Providence appear to you very reaſonable. Before I come to apply this Obſervation, I ſhall only give you one or two Cautions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They are only rewards of this life, by which God rewards the ſervices of wicked men,</hi> whoſe heart in the action is not right. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his</hi> was rewarded, but it was only with a temporary dominion, his ſons for four generations ſate upon the Throne of <hi>Iſrael.

                  <p n="2">2. They are but <hi>temporary rewards, after the enjoyment of which for a time, God uſually puniſheth the ſinner.</hi> Such was the reward of <hi>Jehu,</hi> it laſted but four generations, and then God viſited the blood of <hi>Jezreel</hi> upon the houſe of <hi>Jehu:</hi> It was but a little time that <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> joyed in the reward which God gave him for the great ſervice with which he had made his Army to ſerve againſt <hi>Tyrus,</hi> for the Prophets prophecied of the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſoon after: and the Scripture tells us how it was by the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch. Theſe things premiſed, I now come to the Application: And, 1. By way of <hi>Inſtruction.</hi>

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:192227:202"/>God, ſhall have its proportionable reward. His very Enemies ſhall not do actions for him, but they ſhall have a recompence for them. The liberality of God, even to the worſt of men, ſerving him by the by, and looking quite another way when they are at Gods Oars, ſhould commend God unto us all; and may mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help the People of God to conclude, that their labour of love for God ſhall not be forgotten by him.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. In the ſecond place, this will <hi>inſtruct you in one great reaſon of what is ſuch a beam oft-times in the eyes of Gods beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:</hi> I mean <hi>the proſperity, power, and greatneſs of vile men.</hi> I know it is not always the cauſe, but oft-times it is. They have done ſome actions, from which God hath had a ſervice; it may be God hath uſed them to do ſome great piece of ſervice for his Church, ſo you know he uſed <hi>Cyrus</hi> (upon which the Scripture calleth him Gods ſervant), it may be they have done ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for God againſt his People apoſtatizing: thus <hi>Aſſyria</hi> was the rod of Gods anger, though he did not mean ſo. God had <hi>ſent him</hi> againſt an <hi>hypocritical Nation.</hi> There are many ways by which wicked men may do God ſervice, while they intend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo. It may be ſometimes God will make uſe of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his poor ſervants in diſtreſs, taking advantage of their good natures, or ſome relation they have to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this, though it may be we cannot always give account of the particular cauſe, is the reaſon why God doth great things for them, as to the good things of this life. But there are two more proper branches of Application, which I further aim at, the one concerning ſinners more properly; the other concerning ſuch whoſe hearts are right with God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. In the third place, this Obſervation looketh upon all men, even the worſt of men, and ſpeaketh to them for two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That they would imploy all the talents which God hath given them in ſome ſervice of God.</hi> Sirs, you can none of you work for a more liberal and bountiful maſter; the world is the great thing in the eyes of worldly men, they would be <hi>rich,</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>honourable,</hi> they have no faith, for the riches of glory, no ſenſe of the riches of grace; their language is, <hi>What will you give me?</hi> and underſtand no greater things that God hath to give, than
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:192227:203"/>ſenſible things. Now admit their judgment were right, yet it were their greateſt policy to be doing thoſe things which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially good, and which are unqueſtionably within their power to do, to be making uſe of their eſtates, which they ſpend in luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and wantonneſs, in drinking and gaming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in cloathing the naked, feeding the hungry; the power and intereſt which God hath given them, in the protection of ſuch as fear God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of them from the hands of oppreſſors. I remember it was the counſel of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> to a Heathen King, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Wherefore, O King, let my counſel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy ſins by righteouſneſs, and thy iniquities by ſhewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the poor, if it may be a lengthning of thy tranquillity.</hi> It is a text, that is not without its difficulties, and about which there hath been a great contention betwixt <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the Papiſts from it ſtifly contending for their Doctrine of Merits and Satisfaction, by works of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>charity.</hi> But whiles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves grant, that works by which we can merit, muſt be ſuch as are more than ſtrict duty, and Juſtice and Charity are the two only things which the Prophet doth here adviſe, which we know are duties required of all in innumerable places of Scripture, there can be little pretence for any ſuch building upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. <hi>Daniel</hi> is plainly giving counſel to that Prince, how he might, if not finally avoid, yet for a time turn away that fierce wrath of God which he ſaw was began to kindle againſt him; he adviſeth him to do this, by breaking off his tyrannical oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſhewing mercy, inſtead of that cruelty with which the former part of his reign had been ſtained. Now mark the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it may be a lengthning of thy tranquillity.</hi> I know your margents, tell you it may be read, <hi>It ſhall be an heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your error,</hi> about which ſome leſs judicious Papiſts make a ſtir: but their own great <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> reads it, it ſhall be a <hi>prolongation of thy peace.</hi> Their vulgar <hi>Lat.</hi> reads it, <hi>perhaps he will pardon thy ſins:</hi> the <hi>ſeptuagint</hi>

                     </gap>, perhaps God will bear long with thy ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However (though indeed in that ſenſe it doth not ſo ſute my preſent purpoſe) there is no doubt, but <hi>reſtitution</hi> is an healing of the error of injuſtice and oppreſſion amongſt men, though it be impoſſible that it ſhould remove the guilt of ſin before God. But I have digreſſed too far. Let my counſel be acceptable now to every ſinner, that hath any intereſt in the world, any talent of riches or honour, power
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:192227:203"/>or intereſt, which he might improve in the doing of any thing which God hath commanded. If he be one that hath no regard to his ſoul, but meerly to his intereſt in the world, it is the beſt improvement that he can poſſibly make of it. If a man had ſet his heart againſt the God of Heaven, and deſigned never intentionally to ſerve and honour him, but to make the world and his belly his God, without any belief of, or regard to an eternal well-being; yet it were his greateſt policy to do things materially good, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the obtaining of that portion in this life, for him and his poſterity, upon which he is wholly intent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, This obſervation <hi>ſpeaketh aloud to all to take heed of bleſſing themſelves upon their worldly circumſtances.</hi> It is a thing that we are very prone to, to conclude, to the acceptation of our perſons, and our works, from our outward proſperity. They neither ſignifie any thing to us, as to the <hi>perfect goodneſs of the work,</hi> nor yet as to any <hi>eternal reward,</hi> no, <hi>nor a laſting reward in this life.</hi> We uſe to ſay, <hi>Bonum ex cauſis integris, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ex quolibet defectu,</hi> a work is made evil by any defect in it, the <hi>leaſt fly</hi> maketh the <hi>Apothecaries box of oyntment to ſtink;</hi> the action muſt be <hi>formally,</hi> as well as <hi>materially</hi> good; not only what God hath required, but it muſt be done with a <hi>true heart,</hi> deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory and ſervice of God, and in a true manner, according to that rule which he hath given us for the performance of it, or it cannot be acceptable to a pure and holy God: nor do <hi>theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> ſignifie any thing as to our <hi>eternal reward and recompence.</hi> A man may for a work be rewarded in this life, and yet damned in the world to come: <hi>he hath had his reward.</hi> I remember Chriſt ſaith ſo of the Phariſees prayers and faſtings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>They have their reward:</hi> the diſciples of Chriſt that act ſincerely, <hi>they ſhall be recompenced in the reſurrection of the juſt.</hi> Hypocrites <hi>have their reward,</hi> in the honour and applauſe they have, in the riches and honour which God giveth them. God is out of their debt. No, nor ſecondly (which poſſibly to them is more terrible) theſe kind of <hi>recompences</hi> are but temporary things for a little time. <hi>Jehu</hi> had taken out all his payment from God for his ſervice againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> in four generations. <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> had taken out their rewards for their ſervices much ſooner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. In the next place, This Obſervation may be of very great uſe, both <hi>for the comfort and incouragement of ſuch,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:192227:204"/>hearts are <hi>right with God.</hi> For their <hi>comfort</hi> as to what they have done, for their <hi>incouragement</hi> to go on yet in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deſigns for God. 1. For their <hi>comfort.</hi> It muſt be laid down for a <hi>ſubſtratum</hi> to the following part of my diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Theme, That no man can be called a child of God, but he who doth not ſerve God by the by, <hi>tanquam aliud agens,</hi> in the mean time eying ſome other deſign, and ſetting up to himſelf ſome other end; but he who in his actions ſets himſelf with a full purpoſe of heart, to ſeek, and honour, and glorifie God, he may miſs his mark, either through the miſtake of his eye, or his hand, but his face is thitherward, that's the white at which he aims; he hath ſet the honour and glory of God before him as his mark, and towards it, it is, that he preſſeth forward: he may miſtake (as <hi>David</hi> did) thinking ſomething will be for the honour of God, which will not; or come ſhort as to the iſſue, not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring his deſign to a deſired iſſue; but he taketh his aim right, and ſetteth up his mark right. Now failers in theſe caſes, when once diſcerned by the ſouls of Chriſtians, prove oft-times cauſes of great trouble, and exceeding ſad reflexions to them; and nothing can be thought of as more proper to give them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, than what I have been at this time diſcourſing of. That when God doth not, cannot allow of the action as integrally good and perfect, yet he will <hi>reward the good intention,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and purpoſe in the childs of Gods heart. Methinks in this caſe it is a ſweet text, (they are the words of <hi>Solomon</hi> upon the dedication of the Temple which he had builded, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.18.) <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an houſe unto my name, thou didſt well that it was in thine heart: Nevertheleſs thou ſhalt not build the houſe, but thy ſon that is come out of thy loins, he ſhall build the houſe unto my name.</hi> There are in that text theſe things remarkable. 1. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had an intention to build God an houſe. 2. He did not build this houſe. 3. God did not allow of the action. God ſent him word by <hi>Nathan</hi> he ſhould not do it (as you have heard before). Yet 3. God accepted his good deſign, his general good intention. <hi>Thou didſt well</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that it was in thine heart.</hi> 4. God did not only accept this good deſign and intention, but he alſo rewards it: <hi>Nevertheleſs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thy ſon that is come out of thy loins, he ſhall build me an houſe:</hi> thou ſhalt not have the honour of it, but thy ſon ſhall have the honour of it. <hi>David</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:192227:204"/>a matter in the worſhip of God, without any ſpecial direction; God upon this createth an inſtitution, and legitimateth the action for his ſon. I ſay it is an admirable text, if it be well digeſted, to relieve the ſpirits of the People of God under their troubles for their imperfect performances. A Chriſtian prays, he ſanctifieth a Sabbath, he ſetteth himſelf to ſeek the Lord in any piece of inſtituted worſhip; when he reflecteth upon it, and compareth it with the perfect rule, he ſits down wonderfully troubled, conſidering he hath done nothing as he ought to do; he hath prayed, but with a wofully wandring, diſtracted, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered heart; his heart hath not bled while he hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of ſins, nor believed enough while he hath been putting up his ſupplications to the God of Heaven, nor been raiſed enough in the Meditations of the Divine Goodneſs, whiles his tongue hath been uttering the good things which God hath done for him: To what purpoſe ſhould he do any thing more, who doth nothing as he ought to do it? I would but ask a poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, thus troubled upon any performance, <hi>Was it in thine heart to honour God in what thou didſt?</hi> thou cameſt to <hi>hear the word of God,</hi> or thou cameſt to <hi>humble thy ſelf before God by faſting,</hi> or thou cameſt <hi>to prayer,</hi> or to <hi>receive a ſacrament;</hi> thou reflecteſt upon the action done, thou ſeeſt it full of imperfections, thou haſt not honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God as thou deſiredſt, thy heart hath not been perfect with God. But what was in thine heart in theſe undertakings? was it in thine heart to mock God, or to ſerve God? was not this thy deſign to humble thy ſoul before the Lord, to pay an homage which thy ſoul owed unto God? was it not in thine heart to ſerve God? If it were, believe that thou heareſt God ſaying to thee, Whereas it was in thine heart to pray, to praiſe, to humble thy ſelf before me, to do what I commanded thee to do, <hi>thou didſt well that it was in thine heart:</hi> it may be thou didſt not well in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was not well done in thine hand; but this was well, <hi>that it was in thine heart.</hi> As we ſometimes refuſe ſomething from our friend, and ſay, <hi>I thank you as much as if you did it, but it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; I deſire you to ſpare your pains, I care not for it, or I deſire not it ſhould be done yet, but yet I take it as kindly as if you did it.</hi> Or as we ſometimes accept of what a poor child or ſervant hath done for us, though we do not like it as done to our minds, and excuſe it by ſaying, <hi>Poor child! it intended well:</hi> ſo God doth
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:192227:205"/>with us; methinks what he ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> was as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>I do not yet need any other houſe then I have, I do not care for it:</hi> but this thou didſt not know, <hi>David.</hi> Thou didſt well that it was in thine heart, thou hadſt a good general deſign and intention: and ſo to us, this prayer, this ſervice, this homage is not every way perfect, but yet it was in my childs heart to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me, and to obey my commands. In this he hath done well, I will accept it, becauſe it was in his heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>If there be a willing mind</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it is accepted, not according to what a man hath not, but according to what he hath.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh there with reference to alms, but it is as true as to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties; if there be a willing mind, a true heart, it is accepted of God: I ſhall only caution you, that you miſtake not this <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind</hi> for a pitiful <hi>wiſh</hi> and <hi>velleity,</hi> without a ſetled ſteady purpoſe and reſolution of heart, and ſuch an indeavour, as is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach and compaſs of our power; ſo that there wanteth not a deſire and indeavour, but only a ſtrength and ability to perform. But if there be that, it is of wonderful comfort to us, under all our accuſations and judgings of our ſelves. There is no child of God, but it is in his heart to do better than he doth, it is in his heart to glorifie God in every duty, in every action, in the whole of his converſation; why if it be in his heart, God ſaith to him, <hi>Thou haſt done well that it was in thine heart.</hi> Nay this Meditation hath this advantage, <hi>That God will reward the good that is in his peoples hearts, not only with temporary, but with eternal rewards:</hi> and for this the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is to be praiſed, who hath ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Divine Juſtice for us, and perfectly fulfilled the law for us, and procured this of his Father, <hi>That the will ſhould be accepted for the deed.</hi> Do not therefore think ever to live in any view of your own perfection, you will never do that: <hi>Study only to live in the view of your own ſincerity,</hi> to find that your hearts are right in the ſight of God, take heed of heart-falſhood; ah, that is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to find our hearts falſe with God. Ah! but will ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſoul ſay, How ſhall I know this? how ſhall I know if my heart be right with God in any action, when I ſee the action is not right, but cometh ſhort of the glory of God? I anſwer, thou ſhalt eaſily know, if thou doeſt but conſider what the heart does in humane actions: and that you ſhall underſtand in three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: 1. <hi>It is the eye that takes the aim at the mark.</hi> 2. <hi>It
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:192227:205"/>is that which giveth ſtrength to the bow.</hi> 3. <hi>It is that which gives a man pleaſure in the action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The heart is that which</hi> (as the eye in ſhooting) <hi>gives or takes the aim at the mark.</hi> The tongue ſpeaks in prayer, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man moves in actions of religious worſhip; but the heart now takes the <hi>aim,</hi> and directeth the <hi>intention of the action.</hi> The end of all our actions, is either, 1. <hi>The glory of God:</hi> or, 2. <hi>Our ſelves, our own honour,</hi> &amp;c. If the heart be right with God in actions, the ſcope, deſign, and intention of the ſoul is to glorifie God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.9. <hi>All my deſire is toward thee,</hi> Pſal. 25.15. <hi>Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The heart is that which in humane actions gives ſtrength to the bow.</hi> The ſtrength of a ſpiritual action lyes in the <hi>zeal</hi> or <hi>heat of affection which attendeth the action:</hi> now the heat of this is in the heart. Where a mans heart is not in an action, he acts coldly, he moveth ſlowly, the wheels of a ſoul are in the heart. Where the heart is in an action, it runs, it makes haſte, and delayeth not, it acteth with vigour and fervency.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, <hi>The heart is that which gives a ſoul delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in an action.</hi> Where the heart is not in prayer, in hearing, there is no pleaſure, no ſweetneſs, no delight affecting the ſoul. Examine now thy ſelf by theſe things, thou doeſt that which is materially good, but thou doubteſt whether in thy actions thy heart be right with God. Search and ſee what thy aim and ſcope was: What didſt thou propoſe to thy ſelf in the action? with what life, vigour, and ſtrength didſt thou ſet upon thy action? what pleaſure and delight didſt thou take in the action? though indeed much of the laſt may be kindled in an hour of temptation or deſertion, where the ſoul feeleth not thoſe incomes of divine aſſiſtance, nor that freedom of ſpirit which it hath at other times experienced; yet always the heart aims right, and puts on with what ſtrength it hath; it (like <hi>Sampſon</hi>) riſeth up, and ſays it will do as at other times, though in doing it diſcerneth, that God is departed from it, and is not with it as at other times.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. Again, <hi>How ſhould this encourage us all in the ways of God? notwithſtanding the diſcouragements we may meet with from the temptations of our grand adverſary; or the ſuggeſtions of our
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:192227:206"/>conſciences, founded upon the demonſtrable truth of the imperfections of our beſt ſervices.</hi> We ſay, Uſe maketh perfectneſs, and the Scripture ſaith, That the man of clean hands will grow ſtronger and ſtronger; but in the mean time, acceptation doth not depend upon gradual perfection, but upon the perfection of ſincerity, when the deſign, the purpoſe, the intention is ſincere; when the heart is ſet right for God, and aims truly at the glory of God, and the fulfilling of his Will, then it is accepted; and indeed it is the moſt reaſonable thing in the world, that we ſhould agree with this. For that man or woman hath either a ſtrange imperfect <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature of God, or of the law of God,</hi> that can expect that his duties ſhould be accepted for their gradual perfections, or any intrinſecal value in them. I ſay he that thus thinks, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knows God as he ought to know him, nor yet his own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. But if God will accept of, and reward a good intention, a good purpoſe and deſign, while we find our hearts right bent, and inclined for God, we have no reaſon to be diſcouraged from action.</p>

                  <p>Obſerv. 15. <hi>It is a very ordinary thing for the Providence of God to diſtribute the afflictions and puniſhments of this life, to the very beſt of his people; and as to them ſometimes to ſpare the very worſt of men.</hi> I muſt ſtill mind you that there is no rule ſo general, but it will admit exceptions as to particular caſes, though this hath as few as any.

Hence ſome particular ſervants of God, have been under ſome temptations at ſome times, to queſtion their ſtate as to the favour of God, becauſe their life hath had ſo little of the croſs in it: but they have been rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, to whom Satan hath had an advantage to ſuggeſt ſuch a thought. And as Divines determine it difficult to determine, what ſin a child of God may not fall into, and juſtly too, when-as <hi>David</hi> fell into murther and adultery, <hi>Lot</hi> into drunkenneſs and inceſt, and even <hi>Peter curſed</hi> and <hi>ſware,</hi> and denied his maſter:
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:192227:207"/>ſo it is a matter more difficult to ſay what puniſhment of this life may not fall upon the beſt of men. Indeed ſome <hi>Antinomians</hi> have made it a queſtion, <hi>Whether the afflictions of Gods People may or ought to be called puniſhments or judgments;</hi> but it is a <hi>ſtrife</hi> which they would raiſe about words: if they by puniſhments or judgments, intend ſuch legal demands as God ſhould make for ſatisfaction to his Juſtice, none who underſtandeth what he ſaith, will call the afflictions of good men <hi>puniſhments</hi> in this ſenſe; if they mean any thing elſe, they much betray their ignorance, for the Scripture expreſly calls them by both. God telleth his People that they ſhould not be altogether <hi>unpuniſhed;</hi> and the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>That when we are chaſtened, we are judged of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.32. Moſt certain it is, that it is a very ordinary thing for God in the motions of his Providence to diſtribute all kinds of temporary afflictions, to ſuch as moſt fear his glorious Name, and ſometimes as to ſuch, to ſpare even the worſt of men. <hi>Job</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulates it with God, <hi>Job</hi> 21.7. <hi>Wherefore do the wicked live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come old, yea are mighty in power? their ſeed is eſtabliſhed in their ſight with them, and their off-ſpring before their eyes; their houſes are ſafe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. David</hi> confeſſed, <hi>that his feet were almoſt gone, his ſteps had well-nigh ſlipt,</hi> when he ſaw the <hi>proſperity of the wicked:</hi> though <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>they ſet their mouths againſt heaven;</hi> yet <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>their ſtrength was firm, and there were no bands in their death; they are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued like other men,</hi> v. 7. <hi>Their eyes ſtand out with fatneſs, they have more than heart could wiſh.</hi> In the mean time, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>David</hi> was plagued all the day-long, and <hi>chaſtned every morning.</hi> This motion of Providence hath been evident in the experience of all ages, and there is none who liveth, but may obſerve it every day: but this is accounted one of the Chapters of Divine Providence, which are hard to be underſtood. I ſhall therefore reſerve my further diſcourſe upon it, till I come to the laſt part of my intended diſcourſe, where I ſhall make it my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to give you an account of it, and at preſent paſs on to ſome further Obſervations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv</hi> 16. The next thing I ſhall commend to your remark, is this: <hi>That where to humane appearance Providence moveth moſt flowly, either in the puniſhment of the ſinner, or the rewarding the righteous there at laſt it diſtributeth moſt plentifully.</hi> I obſerved to
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:192227:207"/>you before, that both the puniſhment of the wicked and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the righteous is certain and conſtant, though not always <hi>ſenſible</hi> nor <hi>uniform.</hi> Now I deſire you to obſerve that by how much the <hi>ſlower it is in the puniſhment of ſinners,</hi> or <hi>in bringing rewards to the righteous,</hi> by ſo much the greater the rewards of the godly men, and the puniſhment of ſinners are when they come. I mean ſenſible rewards and puniſhments, for otherwiſe it is true, which I before told you, God is puniſhing ſinners and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding righteous men every day. But as to <hi>ſenſible rewards</hi> and <hi>puniſhments,</hi> God is very often ſlow in the diſtributions of them. The Heathens were wont to ſay, <hi>tardè molunt Deorum molae,</hi> the Gods Mills grind ſlowly; and that their Gods had <hi>lane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os pedes,</hi> feet ſhod with wooll. It is moſt certaintly true of the true and living God. His Mill with which he grindeth ſinners to powder is alwayes going, <hi>He is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> but it <hi>grindeth ſlowly;</hi> he is moving always in order to this end, but he hath <hi>woollen feet:</hi> we cannot hear nor diſcern his motions. But to ſpeak diſtinctly, here are two things in this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. 1. That the <hi>Providence of God</hi> doth ordinarily move <hi>ſlowly in the diſtribution of ſenſible puniſhments to wicked men, or ſenſible rewards to righteous men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That the more ſlow it is in the diſtribution of the one, or of the other, the greater the puniſhment or reward is ordinarily when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> I will begin with ſhewing you the reaſonableneſs of the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>How elſe ſhould God juſtifie his attribute of long-ſuffering and patience?</hi> The attribute of <hi>clemency, patience, long-ſuffering, ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to conceive a wrath,</hi> is an attribute which God maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known by, and doth much glory in, Pſal. 103.8. <hi>The Lord is merciful and gracious, ſlow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> in his prayer <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.17. impleadeth God thus, <hi>Thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs. Joel</hi> maketh uſe of it as an argument to perſwade people to repentance, <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.13. And <hi>Jonah</hi> telleth God, that he knew him to be ſuch a God, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.2. Now how ſhould God juſtifie this name of his, but in his bearing with ſinners a long time, though they be, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Veſſels of wrath fitted for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>How elſe ſhould God lead men by patience to repentance, and render ſinners that continue impenitent inexcuſable.</hi> This is that account which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> giveth us of this diſpenſation of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:192227:208"/>providence. 2 Pet. 3.9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as ſome men do count ſlackneſs, but is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi> and St. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 2.1. ſaith, <hi>Therefore thou art inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, O man,</hi> v. 4. <hi>deſpiſing the riches of his goodneſs, and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee to repentance.</hi> When God giveth men and women ſpace to repent, and they repent not, they become inexcuſable, and God is juſtified in the vials of his wrath which he poureth out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them at laſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>How elſe ſhould God exerciſe the faith, and patience of his people?</hi> The exerciſe of faith is upon an <hi>unſeen reward,</hi> believing what we have no ſenſible evidence of; the exerciſe of <hi>hope</hi> lies in a looking out for it, for <hi>what we ſee, why do we yet hope for?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) the exerciſe of patience is in waiting for it, and a quiet ſubmiſſion to the will of God, in bearing what the Lord will pleaſe to lay upon us, while we are in our way to our promiſed reward. If Gods providence were not ſlow in executing his juſtice, he could not magnifie his own patience and long-ſuffering, and if he were not ſlow in the diſtributions of ſenſible rewards, he could not exerciſe our faith or patience: this is the Reaſon why the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God doth often move ſlowly in the diſtribution both of <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>puniſhments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly obſerve, by how much the ſlowlier God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth to judgement againſt ſinners, by ſo much the more <hi>ſmart the vengeance is when it comes;</hi> and by how much God appeareth more <hi>ſlow in the rewards of the righteous, by ſo much the greater the reward is.</hi> It is obſerved that thoſe men who paſs their lives with the leaſt ſickneſs, are uſually cut off by, or eſcape very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly from the firſt ſickneſs they meet with, either becauſe the <hi>conſtitution of their bodies is ſo ſtrong, that a light ſickneſs will not ſhake them but ſome very acute and malignant diſtemper,</hi> or becauſe <hi>in their long time of health, they have by degrees contracted a very ill habit of body,</hi> ſo that when they fall down it is a very hard matter to reſtore them again. The ſame may be obſerved as to Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential diſpenſations to wicked men, there are ſome againſt whom God proceedeth a long time very ſlowly: though he be angry with them every day, yet he ſpareth them, and doth not fall upon them by any ſevere diſpenſations; but when he doth ſtrike he ſtrikes not twice, he maketh a full end. God bore with the <hi>Amorites</hi> a
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:192227:208"/>a great while; they were a wicked people in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, but their iniquitie was not <hi>full, Gen.</hi> 15.16. God bare with them four hundred years after that, but when he brought judgement upon them, it was a dreadful judgement, as you may both learn by the ſeveral commiſſions given out by God to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt them, and the dreadful deſtruction of them, of which you read in the book of <hi>Joſhua.</hi> Before them God bare with the world a long time, after he had taken up a purpoſe to deſtroy them, and revealed it to <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. he gives them yet the ſpace of an hundred and twenty years; but they abuſing his patience in that time alſo, he brought the flood upon them, and conſumed them all but <hi>Noahs</hi> family. With that generation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> which came out of the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> the Lord ſhewed himſelf <hi>ſlow to wrath, forty years long the Lord was grieved with that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</hi> (forty years is a great while for one generation, the life of man being but ſeventy years) but at length he deſtroyed them all, ſo as only <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> entred into <hi>Canaan.</hi> God bare two hundred and forty years with the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (for ſo many years there were from their Apoſtacy in the time of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> until they were carried away captive <hi>by the King of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria</hi>) but then they were ſo deſtroyed as to this day none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where they are, or any of their poſterity. With the two tribes and an half God yet bare much longer, but at laſt they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> for ſeventy years. After their reſtoration God bare long with them, though they were exerciſed under a variety of afflictive providences, till at laſt they were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed by the <hi>Romans</hi> from being a Nation. The like obſervation might be made of particular perſons. It is obſerved concerning the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the defection from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> that they never had one good King. Moſt of them had very ſhort reigns, except <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Joaſh</hi> who reigned forty two years, and <hi>Jehu</hi> who had done ſuch ſervice againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> who reigned twenty eight years. There were two that reigned twenty two years, both wicked men, and heads of ſeveral idolatrie: <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> he brought in the <hi>worſhipping of the true God by Calves ſet up at</hi> Dan, <hi>and</hi> Bethel; <hi>and</hi> Ahab, who brought in the worſhipping of <hi>Baal,</hi> both of them very wicked men, and God proceeded to execute vengeance ſlowly upon them; but when it came, it was a dreadful vengeance. Of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> houſe none but a little Son
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:192227:209"/>came to the grave in peace. For <hi>Ahab</hi> himſelf, you know, he was ſlain in a battel, his queen was thrown headlong out of a window, and her brains daſhed out, and the dogs licked her blood; his ſecond Son was ſlain by <hi>Jehu:</hi> ſeventy more of his Sons were ſlain by the command of <hi>Jehu.</hi> It were eaſie to give you infinite inſtances out of ſtory, but I leave it to your experimental obſervation. Mark any perſon whom you ſee exemplarily wicked, yet God is patient with him a long time, and obſerve what havock God makes with him and his poſterity when he beginneth to reckon with him. And indeed it ſeems very reaſonable if you conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That by reaſon of Gods <hi>ſlowneſs to puniſh the ſinner, his ſins are multiplied and aggravated to an exceeding great number and degree.</hi> It was <hi>Solomons</hi> obſervation, which we ſhall ſee verified in our daily experience, Eccl. 8.11. <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil.</hi> The iniquity of the <hi>Amorites</hi> had not been full, if God had not been ſo patient with them. This makes them, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgement of God.</hi> Now the righteous God rendring to every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his work, muſt proportion his judgements to peoples ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. The more their ſins are, the greater ſhall his wrath be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The more patience is abuſed, the more means of grace are loſt, the greater alwayes is divine vengeance.</hi> Now where God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth ſlowly to vengeance, there he exerciſeth moſt patience. There patience is moſt abuſed, there more ſpace and time for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is loſt; there is moſt deſpiſing of the riches of divine goodneſs, forbearance and long-ſuffering. <hi>Et laeſa patientia fit furor,</hi> abuſed patience turns into fury. It maketh a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and long-ſuffering God cry out by his Prophet, <hi>Ah! I will eaſe me of mine enemies, and avenge me of my adverſaries;</hi> him that knoweth not how to give up <hi>Ephraim,</hi> to ſet him as <hi>Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> two of the Cities whom he ſo dreadfully deſtroyed by fire and brimſtone. It maketh God, who is a Lamb in his own nature, to transform himſelf into a <hi>Lion,</hi> a <hi>Leopard,</hi> a <hi>Bare rob'd of her whelps.</hi> O it is a dreadful thing to abuſe much divine pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience! Now where the providence of God hath appeared ſlow in puniſhing ſinners, there muſt much patience have been ſhewn. And it muſt have been abuſed too if a ſinner continues hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and impenitent. <hi>I have given ſpace</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>to repent of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:192227:209"/>her fornication, and ſhe repented not,</hi> Rev. 2.21, 22. <hi>Behold I will caſt her into a Bed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>into great tribulation, and I will kill her children with death.</hi> Beſides, that God ſeldom exerciſeth pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence long with ſinners, but he gives them alſo other means of grace, and they are abuſed and ſlighted. <hi>Noah preached to the old world;</hi> ſaith God, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive with man:</hi> and I need not tell you how dreadfully God threatneth <hi>Corazin, Bethſaida</hi> and <hi>Capernaum</hi> for their abuſing the means of grace they had had above other places. The like might be proved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the providence of God in the diſtributions of rewards; <hi>the ſlower the motion of Providence is in the giving them, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordinarily the rewards are.</hi> It was a great while before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had a Son, but when he had him, it proved to be one that was a great bleſſing both to his Fathers family and to the world. <hi>Rebeccah</hi> went twenty years without Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.20, 26. but then <hi>twins ſtruggle in her womb,</hi> and ſhe brings forth two great Princes, and one of them who was to be the head of the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people God had upon the earth. <hi>Rachel</hi> was for ſome years <hi>barren, Gen.</hi> 29.31. c. 30. v. 1. when God gave her a Child it was <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who proved ſuch an eminent bleſſing to his Fathers houſe. The Wife of <hi>Manoah</hi> was barren, <hi>Jud.</hi> 13.2. ſhe bringeth forth <hi>Samſon. Hannah</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. was barren, ſhe bringeth forth <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel. Elizabeth</hi> was <hi>barren,</hi> ſhe brings forth <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> Thus you ſee it as to the bleſſing of Children. It was a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God brought the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> his ſervant out of their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, but when he did he brought them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land which the Lord cared for, upon which his eyes were <hi>from the beginning of the year unto the end thereof, a land which flowed with Milk and Hony.</hi> There was a great time betwixt <hi>Joſephs</hi> dream and his exaltation in <hi>Egypt.</hi> There were eight years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Davids <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> and <hi>Coronation</hi> in <hi>Hebron.</hi> More inſtances might be given, but it is no more than we ſhall ordinarily obſerve in the motions of divine providence; the ſlower the mercy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the fuller it is and greater bleſſing when it cometh: Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ordinarily their greateſt peace and comforts after their longeſt, and greateſt trials, and afflictions.</p>
                  <p>The reaſonableneſs of this motion of divine Providence appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this, that look as in puniſhing of ſinners where Providence moveth ſlowly, it uſually hath a great heap of ſins to reckon with men for; ſo here it hath <hi>great faith</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> to reward
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:192227:210"/>in this caſe. <hi>Tribulation worketh patience,</hi> and <hi>patience experience,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. where there is long <hi>tribulation</hi> there muſt be the exerciſe of much <hi>faith,</hi> much <hi>patience,</hi> much <hi>hope,</hi> and this brings forth much <hi>experience:</hi> Gods greateſt rewards of joy and peace in the inward man, of eternal life, glory and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, come after much waiting. The Apoſtle telleth us Heb. 10.36. <hi>You have need of Patience, that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promiſe.</hi> The receiving of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe then is after much patience in <hi>doing the will of God,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7. The Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>God will render unto every man according to his deeds, to them who by patient continuance in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, ſeek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life.</hi> But I have been large enough in the confirmation of this obſervation, I proceed to ſome application of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. In the firſt place, <hi>What can ſtrike a greater trembling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the loins of ſinners than this?</hi> I ſhewed you before that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of a reſolved impenitent ſinner is <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>conſtant.</hi> As well may he promiſe himſelf that he ſhall not dye, as that he ſhall not be turned into Hell, and at laſt hear that dreadful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting burnings:</hi> it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant though he is not ſenſible of it, yet God is angry with him every day: he every day groweth worſe and worſe, more blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hardned, given up more to <hi>vile affections,</hi> a <hi>reprobate mind,</hi> a conſcience as it were <hi>ſeared with an hot iron:</hi> all that he hath to bleſs himſelf in, and for, is <hi>that all things continue with him as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,</hi> he yet ſees no alteration in his eſtate, he feeleth nothing <hi>of the wrath</hi> of God. Now this obſervation ſpoiles all the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this. The Heathens obſerved that the Gods though they had <hi>laneos pedes,</hi> yet they had <hi>ferreas manus;</hi> though they had woolen feet and moved gently, ſoftly, inſenſibly, yet their hands were of iron; when once they laid hold of wicked men they cruſhed them to pieces. I am ſure it is true of him who is the true and living God. He is ſlow to conceive a wrath, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with great ſinners a long time, but when he enters into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with men that abuſe his long-ſuffering and patience, which ſhould lead them to repentance he falleth upon them with a dreadful deſtruction. O let all ſinners that hear this, fear and tremble. There is no ſuch dreadful vengeance as that which God taketh for abuſed patience. Bleſs not your ſelves therefore in
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:192227:210"/>your preſent impunity. Hoſea 13.12. <hi>The iniquity of Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im is bound up;</hi> his <hi>ſin is hid,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, bound up as in a bundle. There are ſome other Scriptures much to the ſame ſenſe, Deut. 32.33, 34. <hi>Their wine is the poyſon of Dragons, and the cruel venome of Aſps.</hi> v. 34. <hi>Is not this laid up in ſtore with me? and ſealed up amongſt my treaſures?</hi> Job. 14.17. <hi>My tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſealed up in a bag, and thou ſoweſt up my iniquity.</hi> Lam. 1.14. <hi>The yoke of my tranſgreſſions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed and come up upon my neck.</hi> It is the great folly of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they will ſay with <hi>Agag, the bitterneſs of death is paſt;</hi> they ſin and go on a long time in ſin and God ſpareth them, and they conclude all is forgot. No ſaith God it is not, <hi>the iniquity of Ephraim</hi> is not like a looſe paper blown away, it is bound up as papers in a bundle, it is not forgot, it is but <hi>hid</hi> with me, I have their ſins ſtill in remembrance. <hi>I held my peace</hi> (ſaid God by the Pſalmiſt) <hi>and thou thoughteſt me ſuch a one as thy ſelf, but I will reprove thee, and ſet thy ſins in order before thee.</hi> Some think that the Metaphor in <hi>Hoſea</hi> is taken from labourers that labour in husbandry, who bind up in faggots wood that is to be kept ſome time before it be thrown on to the fire. <hi>Ephraim</hi> thinks his iniquity is forgotten becauſe ſin is not preſently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: but ſaid God, his <hi>ſin,</hi> that is, (ſay ſome but I ſee no need of it) the puniſhment of his ſin (as indeed it often is taken in Scripture), is but bound up and concealed a little. Others think it a metaphor drawn from men, who bind up mony in bags till the day of payment comes, and thus it agrees with that <hi>Job;</hi> 14.17. my tranſgreſſion <hi>is ſealed up in a bag.</hi> Beſides that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifies a purſe, or bag, they are <hi>bound up,</hi> they are not pardoned or forgotten: thus the <hi>binding</hi> of ſins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. ſignifieth a remaining unpardoned. Some think the metaphor both in <hi>Job</hi> and in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> is taken from Lawyers, who carry their informations and enditements <hi>ſealed up in a bag,</hi> or bound up in a bundle, that they may not be loſt and ſcattered, but be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming when they will put them into Court. This is a dreadful meditation for an impenitent ſinner, that all his ſins are <hi>bound up in a bundle, ſealed up in a bag,</hi> hid, not from God (nothing can be ſo hid) but <hi>hid with God.</hi> What loads of Faggots hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a poor creature bound up for him againſt the great day of burning! what a bundle of <hi>informations</hi> and inditements have ſome poor creatures bound up for them, againſt the time that the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:192227:211"/>Judge ſhall ſit, and God ſhall come forth to recompence men for their evil deeds! Thou thinkeſt the vanity and wickedneſs of thy youth, thy oaths and blaſphemies, thy lies and ſabbath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanations, thy drunkenneſs and uncleanneſs is done with: No ſuch matter poor creature! if thou goeſt on in thy impenitency, they are but <hi>ſealed up in a bag,</hi> they are but bound up in a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, they are but <hi>treaſured up</hi> (to uſe the Apoſtles expreſſion <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.) againſt the day of wrath and the revelation of the righteous judgement of God, which if it be not in this life (as very often it is) yet will certainly be in the life that is to come. Remember <hi>Ahab,</hi> he was a wicked Prince, God bare with him a long time, he ſhed much blood, was a great perſecutor, ſet up a moſt odious idolatry. God held his peace a great while, and proceeded ſlowly. Two and twenty years he ran his courſe, God ſealed <hi>up all in a bag;</hi> but obſerve with what a dreadful ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance God comes upon him at laſt. It may be thou canſt ſay, oh! but I have gone on longer, twice two and twenty years: it may be ſo, but what ſaith the Scripture? <hi>if a ſinner do evil an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, and his days be prolonged, yet it ſhall not be well with the wicked,</hi> there are but ſo many faggots more bound up, ſo many enditements more againſt thee in Gods bag ſealed up, oh! <hi>let the ſinners in the world be afraid, let trembling ſurprize them all.</hi> The ſlower vengeance cometh, the more dreadfully it cometh. That <hi>upon you may come</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>all the righteous blood that hath been ſhed from the blood of</hi> Abel <hi>to the blood of</hi> Zacharias. There were great quantities of blood ſhed in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> betwixt the time of <hi>Abel</hi> and the <hi>blood of Zacharias. Verily</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>all theſe things ſhall come upon this generation.</hi> O let every impenitent ſinner tremble at the hearing of this, that there is coming upon his ſoul, his body, his family, all the ſin that he hath committed, from the <hi>ſin that clave to him in his Mothers womb, where he was conceived in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity, unto the ſin of the laſt hour that he hath lived in the world.</hi> It was a dreadful reckoning that God made up at laſt with <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for all their blood, and it will be a dreadful reckoning, Sirs, God will have to make up with every ſinners ſoul, eſpecially with old ſinners.</p>

Our ſins cannot be hidden from God, they are all in the light of his Countenance; a man then covereth and hideth his ſins from God when he doth not confeſs and bewail them.

In the laſt place, this obſervation calleth upon all ſuch as fear the Lord, and walk before him: for <hi>a progreſs in the wayes of God and a patient waiting for the promiſe.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, Heb. 10.36. <hi>That we have need of patience, that after we have done the will of God we might receive the promiſe.</hi> It is our duty as to do well, ſo not to be weary of <hi>well doing:</hi> it is preſſed upon us, Gal. 6.9. <hi>And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due ſeaſon we ſhall reap if we faint not.</hi> And again, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.13.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:192227:212"/>
                     <hi>but you brethren be not weary in well-doing.</hi> There is nothing ſo far conduceth to make us faint and weary in our duty, as when we ſee nothing comes of it: we have hopes and promiſes, but no iſſue, no performance; you know <hi>Solomon</hi> tells you, <hi>hope deferred makes the heart ſick.</hi> Now this is a great cordial in ſuch a caſe for us to hear, that when providence moveth ſlowly in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rewards to the righteous, it recompenceth our patience at laſt with the riches and liberality of the reward. Indeed here are three or four arguments, which together with this obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtle hinteth me in the afore-mentioned Text out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> we <hi>ſhall reap,</hi> we <hi>ſhall reap in due ſeaſon.</hi> Our fainting will ſpoil our reaping. The longer it is before we reap, the greater the crop of mercy and bleſſing ſhall be which we ſhall reap.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We ſhall reap.</hi> He that ploweth up the fallow-ground of his heart and ſoweth to the glory of God, and to the good of his own ſoul in righteouſneſs, <hi>he ſhall reap.</hi> The Husbandman that ſowes his Wheat and Barly cannot promiſe himſelf that he ſhall reap; the ſouldier, the plunderer may reap what he hath ſown; a tempeſt, an eaſt-wind, lightning, many other things may hinder his reaping; but he who ſowes righteouſneſs he ſhall reap, nothing ſhall hinder his reaping.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He ſhall reap in due ſeaſon.</hi> It may be he ſhall not reap <hi>in his ſeaſon,</hi> the ſeaſon which he expected; but he ſhall reap <hi>in due ſeaſon,</hi> in ſuch a time as the wiſe God judgeth moſt ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and when he cometh to reap, he ſhall alſo acknowledge the ſeaſonableneſs of it that it is in due ſeaſon; we do not know the fitteſt time for our own mercies, God knowes the fitteſt ſeaſon, we ſhall reap in due ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider <hi>that our reaping dependeth upon our not fainting, we ſhall reap</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>if we faint not. If any ſoul draweth back, Gods ſoul will have no pleaſure in him;</hi> he who draweth back, draweth back to his own perdition.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. and Laſtly, our reward will be <hi>ſo much the greater, by how much it is ſlower:</hi> the rewards of Gods people are ordinarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to their patient waiting. The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken of Chriſts coming to <hi>render to every man according to his work,</hi> addeth v. 7. <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well-doing ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life.</hi> Yea and certainly degrees of glory will be proportioned to our
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:192227:212"/>patience: thoſe that have had leaſt ſenſible rewards in this life (if there be ſuch a thing as degrees of glory) may expect ſome of the higheſt ſeats, and manſions of glory in that life which is to come. But I ſhall add no more to this Obſervation.</p>

                  <p>I Go on yet in my obſervations concerning the Actual Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and that more eſpecially in dealing out diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive juſtice, recompenſing the righteous and the unrighteous. I obſerved the laſt time that it is a thing very ordinary with Divine Providence to proceed ſlowly in theſe diſtributions. But by how much ſlower the puniſhment of a ſinner, or the reward of a good man cometh from the Lord, by ſo much the greater, both the one and the other is. I now proceed to another Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>Obſervat. 17. <hi>That the Providence of God is very quick in the diſtribution both of puniſhments and rewards unto ſome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall diſcourſe it firſt with relation to <hi>puniſhments,</hi> and then with reference to the <hi>rewards of Providence. Firſt,</hi> As to <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24. hath this expreſſion, <hi>Some mens ſins are open before-hand unto judgement, and ſome mens they follow after: likewiſe alſo the good works of ſome are manifeſt before-hand, and they that are otherwiſe cannot be hid.</hi> I know it is a Text of which Interpreters give various ſenſes, as they underſtand it of the <hi>judgment of God,</hi> ſome of them, others of the <hi>judgement of men;</hi> and amongſt thoſe who underſtand it of the later, ſome underſtand it of the judgment of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> others of the <hi>judgment of the Church;</hi> ſome of both theſe, ſome of the judgment of God, and the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:192227:213"/>judgment alſo. I ſhall not pretend to give the juſt ſenſe of it, I ſhall only allude to it in my diſcourſe. As there are ſome ſins that are open and manifeſt with reſpect to the filth and guilt of them; they do not hide their ſin, but proclaim it as <hi>Sodom,</hi> they go to the Devil with a trumpet before them, all the world takes notice of them; others ſin more ſecretly and ſlily and in corners. So God as to ſome ſinners ſits in judgement <hi>preſently.</hi> Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is more ſlow with, they are kept to the great Aſſize, or for many years, but he is not ſo ſlow with all, but either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by his own hand, (as in the caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira Acts</hi> 5.) or elſe by the ſword of the Magiſtrate, he cuts them off preſently, and giveth them a ſudden recompence of their evil deeds. Now it may poſſibly be asked by ſome, what are thoſe ſins, or in what caſe is God ſo quick with ſinners; nor may the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry be unprofitable for us, for <hi>becauſe judgement is not executed ſpeedily, the heart of man is ſet in him to do evil.</hi> Gods defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring judgment and giving day for the execution of his wrath, doth much embolden ſinners. Let us therefore ſee in what caſes God ſeldom grants reprieves, but is very quick with ſinners, and ſendeth them down to Hell reeking with their luſts; this I ſhall indeavour to ſhew you in ſeveral particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It is hard to name any ſpecies of ſins, as to which God hath not made, or doth not make ſome preſent examples of his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:</hi> So as no ſinner can promiſe himſelf the reprieve of an hour or day. 1. In the caſe of <hi>Idolatry</hi> (which is a grievous ſin againſt the firſt and ſecond commandment) you will find that God proceeded very ſlowly to judgment for this ſin, both in the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites,</hi> and in the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> with the <hi>Canaanites</hi> though they were abominable idolaters, God bare many hundreds of years. With the ten tribes who were idolaters, from the time of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael to ſin,</hi> unto the time when they were finally deſtroyed, and carried away captives, God bare with them a long time: but you ſhall find God quicker at another time, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. The people make <hi>themſelves a golden Calf. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> comes down from the Mount, and findeth them at their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous worſhip. <hi>Moſes</hi> commandeth the ſons of <hi>Levi to put eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his ſword by his ſide, and to go in and out from gate to gate throughout the Camp, and to ſlay every man his Brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 28. it is ſaid that the <hi>children of Levi did according to the word of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:192227:213"/>And there fell of the people that day about three thouſand men.</hi> There God was very quick with idolaters. <hi>Blaſpheming, Curſing</hi> and <hi>ſwearing</hi> is a ſin, againſt the <hi>third commandment.</hi> God as to the puniſhment of theſe ſins ſometimes proceedeth very ſlowly: but not alwaies. Look into <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.10. There was the ſon of an <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> woman that <hi>blaſphemed the name of the Lord, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> he was put in priſon. God preſently giveth order concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, v. 14. <hi>That he ſhould be brought forth without the Camp, and ſtoned to death preſently. Sabbath-breaking</hi> (it is a ſin againſt the fourth precept of the Decalogue) God is ordinarily very ſlow in the puniſhing of this ſin: many a Sabbath-breaker goeth on year after year, and yet is not puniſhed, but God doth not do thus with all. The man that did but gather ſticks upon the Sabbath-day was ſtoned to death by Gods expreſs order and command, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.35. <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt <hi>Parents, curſing</hi> them and <hi>diſhonouring</hi> them is a very great ſin, yet God beareth with many wretches a long time that are guilty of it, as we ſee in the experience of our own lives. A wretched Child is a plague to his Parents many years: but God doth not always bear with ſinners in this caſe. See what a Law God gave the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in this caſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.18, 19, 20, 21. God ordered <hi>That he ſhould be preſently ſtoned to death, that would not obey the voice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother.</hi> For <hi>Murther,</hi> which is a ſin againſt the ſixth Commandment, I ſhall not inlarge, I ſhall ſhew you anon that it is a ſin which God rarely ſuffereth to go long unpuniſhed. The Law of God determined preſent death, for wilful murder, and the laws of moſt nations are accordingly; and we daily ſee the providence of God ſtrangely working to make murtherers exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his vengeance. <hi>Adultery</hi> is a ſin againſt the ſeventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; God ſometimes is very patient and proceedeth very ſlowly, but yet not always; ſometimes he ſtrikes a dart through his liver ſooner. God eſtabliſhed a law in the Jewiſh polity; <hi>That the Adulterer ſhould be put to death,</hi> Lev. 20.10. Deut. 22.22. and you know <hi>Phinehas</hi> preſently took a <hi>Javelin,</hi> and ran it through an <hi>Adulterer</hi> and an <hi>Adultereſs</hi> and had an ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward given him from God for it. In the caſe of theft, God may ſometimes be very patient, and doubtleſs there are many old Thieves in the world, who yet will not eſcape the vengeance of God at laſt. But God is not always patient with all theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>Achan was an eminent Thief,</hi> he laid his hands upon Gods
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:192227:214"/>goods, God had firſt ſeized upon the goods of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and ſet them a part for a ſacrifice by fire to himſelf: <hi>Achan</hi> ſteals a <hi>wedge of Gold,</hi> and a <hi>Babiloniſh garment;</hi> God preſently reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it, firſt upon all the Army of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of which he was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, then upon himſelf, and his family, who were ſtoned to death with ſtones. For <hi>lying,</hi> and <hi>bearing a falſe teſtimony,</hi> witneſſing againſt the life of another as <hi>a criminal,</hi> who was not <hi>a criminal,</hi> they are ſins againſt the ninth Commandment; God is often very patient with theſe ſinners, he doth not preſently enter into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with every <hi>liar,</hi> every <hi>Informer</hi> and accuſer of the ſervants of God. Some he reſerveth <hi>in the chains of an hard and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent heart, unto the judgement of the great day:</hi> but yet with ſome of theſe ſinners God is much quicker. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> as you know, fell down dead with a <hi>lye</hi> in their mouths, and the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the <hi>three children,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> were preſently deſtroyed; the firſt by the heat of that Furnace, which they had made ſo hot for others; the ſecond by thoſe <hi>Lions,</hi> which they had procured <hi>Daniel</hi> to be thrown unto. But this is enough to have ſaid in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of my firſt concluſion, That it is hard to name any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of ſinners, but God hath been very quick with ſome individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of their company.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I find ſome Divines obſerving, <hi>That God is ordinarily moſt ſevere upon the firſt violators of his laws:</hi> and this is the reaſon that is given by ſome, why the <hi>Sabbath-breaker</hi> was ordered to be <hi>ſtoned to death.</hi> God had newly revealed his will upon <hi>Mount Sinai, Exod.</hi> 31.14. and repeated it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. Now God picks out one of the firſt open preſumptuous violators of it to make him an example; you know this is after the manner of men, who are uſually very ſevere upon the firſt execution of their laws. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were not the firſt that had told a lye, but they were the firſt that we read of, who had told a lye in that buſineſs. It was the Will of God that to ſupply the neceſſities of his Church at that time, the Chriſtians ſhould have all things for a time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt them; and it was not without a divine inſtinct at leaſt, that ſo many of them ſold their goods, and came and-brought the price of them to the Apoſtles, and laid it at their feet. Now theſe two ſeeming profeſſors to ſave their goods told a lye. God takes a very quick vengeance upon them for it. This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is not my own; having therefore named it, I ſhall leave it to your further obſervation, how the Providence of God juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:192227:214"/>3. There are, thirdly, <hi>ſome particular ſins which God ſeldom ſuffereth to go long unpuniſhed.</hi> I will inſtance in ſome,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Scandalous and impudent <hi>blaſphemy.</hi> Blaſphemy is a ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil of God, either denying him what is due to him, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing that to him, which can by no means agree to his holy Eſſence; but yet there is a great deal of difference betwixt a bare denial of that to God, or to any perſon in the Godhead, which is due to them; or attributing that to God, which cannot agree to him from a meer error of Judgment, and miſtake and miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Scripture, and doing this with ſcandalous reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful terms, and a bold and daring defiance of God, for which men can pretend nothing of conſcience. God may bear long with blaſphemers of the firſt ſort; ſuch are the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Socinians,</hi> &amp;c. But he is ordinarily very quick in the execution of his vengeance upon the others; the inſtances of <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhakeh,</hi> and others in Scripture are very obvious, and it were an eaſie thing to add to them a great deal out of Eccleſiaſtical ſtory: but if you obſerve the Providences of God in the days wherein you live, you will ſee this notion juſtified every day: it cannot ſtand with the honour of God long to bear with bold defiers and reproachers of his glorious Majeſty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond ſort of ſinners, whom <hi>Divine vengeance</hi> uſeth not to ſpare or ſuffer long, are <hi>murtherers.</hi> God hath ſecured the lives of all men by ſpecial laws, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Whoſo ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> It is one you know of thoſe Ten Commandments which God gave upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> Exod. 20. <hi>Thou ſhalt do no murther.</hi> God expreſly commanded, <hi>That no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction ſhould be taken for the life of the murtherer,</hi> Numb. 35.31, 32, 33. and tells us, the land where murther is committed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>be purged but by the blood of him that ſhed it;</hi> and it is a very ordinary obſervation, that <hi>murther will out;</hi> and we ſee it in our ordinary experience. There is nothing more remarkable in our obſervation, than the variety of methods, which the Providence of God uſeth in the diſcovery of murther: but I remember in my former diſcourſes, I have ſpoken ſomething of this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third ſort of ſinners, which God in his <hi>Actual Providence,</hi> is ordinarily <hi>very quick with,</hi> are <hi>Perſecutors.</hi> Perſecution is a violent purſuit of another for the open profeſſion of ſome neceſſary truth; whether thoſe that do it, have an humane law in the caſe or no, maketh little or no difference in the caſe. You know the <hi>Jews</hi>
                     <pb n="392" facs="tcp:192227:215"/>ſaid, <hi>We have a law, and by that law he ought to dye,</hi> yet I hope they perſecuted Chriſt: the Perſecutors of the <hi>three children,</hi> and of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> had a law, or what in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, was equivalent, a decree of the Supreme Magiſtrate. In ſhort, there hath been little or no perſecution ever in the world, if humane Laws will alter the caſe. It is a moſt vile and cauſeleſs tranſgreſſion, and as (I have before obſerved to you) though Hiſtory tells us of perſecutions that laſted many years, yet you rarely know God bear long with furious and individual perfecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, whether they were <hi>Informers, Delators, Accuſers</hi> or <hi>Judges;</hi> you know how quick God was with the <hi>accuſers of the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and of Daniel.</hi> The Providence of God in all times hath juſtified, and ſtill doth ſo eminently juſtifie this Obſervation, that it were to abuſe your patience, to enlarge far upon it; it is very rare that a <hi>Perſecutor</hi> doth not carry ſome mark of <hi>Divine venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> upon him to his grave.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth ſort of ſinners, with whom the Providence of God is ordinarily <hi>very quick,</hi> is ſuch as <hi>eminently affront,</hi> or do <hi>ſome eminent injury to their ſuperiors.</hi> This is juſtified by all that I ſaid before of the conſpicuouſneſs of Divine Providence, in the protection of thoſe whom he hath ſet to rule over others. I gave you many inſtances. That of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> may be added, you know the Earth opened her mouth, and ſwallowed them up; to which may be added that of <hi>Miriam,</hi> who was ſtricken with the plague of leproſie, for her affront to <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Law of God concerning a rebellious Son (which I before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon) is another inſtance. In ſhort, mark it of whom you will, where ſome eminent affronts are by any offered to the publick government of a nation, eſpecially where the rulers rule well, and do their duty, or in a Church, or (finally) in a private family, God doth very rarely let it go long unrevenged. If any one ſhall ask me the reaſon of this quickneſs of Divine Providence with ſome ſorts of ſinners, theſe particularly which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, though I think it a great preſumption for any to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to give the reaſon of any Divine Motions; yet I do not think it difficult to ſhew you that they are exceeding reaſonable, and what thoſe imperfect remains of right reaſon, which ſince the fall are left in us, muſt readily ſo acknowledg.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For the vindication of the Divine Majeſty and authority,</hi> as it is natural to every creature, to uſe all its power to preſerve its
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:192227:215"/>own being; ſo it is natural to rational beings to preſerve their own honour, and to maintain their reputation. The Glory, Honour, Majeſty, and Authority of God are things which he will not give unto others, which he will not proſtitute to the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did luſts of worms. Now though every ſin doth impeach his Glory, yet not every ſin alike: as amongſt men, thoſe who are firſt in the violation of a Law, ſeem moſt to confront, and dare, and debaſe the authority that made it; ſo thoſe who are the firſt examples of ſinning againſt a Divine Law, or who teach the world new kinds of ſins and diſorders, being the boldeſt affronters of the Divine Authority, uſually are made more quick examples of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance: ſo for the <hi>blaſphemer,</hi> he is the moſt eminent contemner of the Divine Majeſty and Glory, he ſpeaketh evil of the ſupreme good, and ſpits as it were in the face of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent being, and curſeth him that is the fountain of bleſſing: <hi>God over all bleſſed for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of Gods <hi>love to mankind, the ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Providence towards man, and the order and government of humane ſocieties, and thoſe whom he hath ſet up to rule over others;</hi> I have obſerved to you before, that man is under a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty of Providence above all other creatures; that amongſt men thoſe whom God hath ſet to rule well, whether in Church or State, are under a further ſpecial care; that he hath hedged them about by more particular and ſpecial Laws. Now if God by his Providence did not make ſome eminent examples of his ſeverity and juſtice, and proceed quickly againſt them, how ſhould his ſpecial Providence be manifeſted?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is but reaſonable, that God ſhould make Perſecutors quick examples of his vengeance, if we conſider <hi>what a complication of ſin there is in the violent proſecution of others, for the profeſſion of the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There is eminent injury done to God:</hi> he is hindered as to the calves of thoſe lips which the perſecutor ſhuts up. All the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate honour which God hath in the world, is from the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, from the prayers and praiſes of his People. Now if God hath any glory from the publication of his Goſpel, from the joynt-prayers and praiſes of his Saints, the perſecutor that hindereth theſe, robbeth God of it, and ſetteth himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the God of Heaven and Earth in thoſe things, whereby he hath choſen to be honoured; his buſineſs is to interrupt, diſturb, and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:192227:216"/>hinder the making known of Chriſt to poor ſouls, to hinder Gods Peoples joynt-praiſes of him, and prayers to him; he ſaith to thoſe whom he perſecuteth, You ſhall not ſerve God, and thus bids an impudent and bold defiance to the Lord of Heaven and Earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is in <hi>perſecution</hi> an eminent injury done to our <hi>neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> God is not only the avenger of his own glory, but concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injuries done to men, he hath ſaid, <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it.</hi> Now in all perſecutions there muſt be ſome great wrong done to our neighbour, either as to his name, or liberty, or eſtate, or life. And, ſecondly, it is an <hi>injury</hi> done to him <hi>cauſeleſly,</hi> not by way of retaliation. In truth it is the Image of God which the perſecutor flies upon, and it is the <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of his brother, which he is not able to endure, ſeeing his own leud and abominable life condemned, by his neighbours more righteous converſation. It is therefore but reaſonable, that that God who is jealous of his own glory, and the judg of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon, and who hath ſaid, <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it,</hi> ſhould be ſevere in his dealings with ſuch ſinners, and for his <hi>elect ſake ſhorten the days</hi> of ſuch blood-thirſty men. But this is enough to have ſpoken to the firſt part of the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>I told you, ſecondly, that the Providence of God, is alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very quick in the diſtribution of rewards; and this you ſhall eſpecially obſerve in theſe caſes 1. <hi>In rewards of ſuch as have been eminent ſufferers for God.</hi> God doth variouſly reward ſuch perſons, ſometimes by <hi>temporal rewards</hi> that are ſenſible and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: ſometimes ſuch as are more <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Now Gods Providence is often very quick in ſuch diſtributions, how quickly did God reward <hi>Daniel,</hi> after he came out of the Lions den? and the three Children, after they came out of the fiery Furnace; and <hi>Mordecai</hi> after h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that are more inward, and diſcerned only by thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; how many inſtances might be given, of ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of joy, and peace, and ſtrength, with which the ſuffering ſervants of God have been rewarded ſo as their inward joy hath drowned their pain, quenched as it were the flame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="395" facs="tcp:192227:216"/>2. In the rewards of <hi>ſuch as have done ſome great and eminent ſervice for God;</hi> bearing ſome ſignal teſtimony againſt ſin, as in the caſe of <hi>Phinehas</hi> who ſlew <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi, Num.</hi> 25.11. or been faithful in ſome great ſervice, in which others have made ſome <hi>great defection,</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua, Num.</hi> 14.6. who brought up a true report of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and gave in a true teſtimony for God againſt all the reſt of the Spies, and when the whole people were in a mutiny.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You ſhall obſerve, that the Providence of God is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very quick in rewarding <hi>wicked men for any ſervice they do him.</hi> I might give you many inſtances of this, that of <hi>Jehu</hi> is an eminent one; God gave him and his poſterity a preſent reward for the good ſervice he had done againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab;</hi> and he gave the <hi>King of Aſſyria</hi> a preſent reward for the ſervice, wherewith he had made his Army to ſerve againſt <hi>Tyrus.</hi> The like obſervation might be made in many other caſes, and it is no more than we may make a daily obſervation of: when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe whom he intendeth not to reward eternally, he doth it in this life quickly. And the motions of Divine Providence, in theſe caſes cannot but appear to be highly reaſonable, if we do but conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this is but <hi>after the manner of men, to ſuch as do ſignal and eminent ſervices, to give both preſent and great rewards,</hi> for the encouragement of others: though ordinarily common ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſometimes ſtay for their pay; yet ſome perſons that have ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized their valour, are often Knighted in the field, and ſome mark of great favour faſtned upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>Divine righteouſneſs is thus fulfilled, and not only ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, but ſo conſpicuouſly, that all the world may take notice:</hi> that God is a <hi>righteous God, fulfilling his word,</hi> and that no man ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him for nothing. Godlineſs, (as the Apoſtle tells us) hath promiſe not only of that life which is to come, but of this life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Mar. 10.29, 30. <hi>There is no man that hath left houſe, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, for my ſake, or the Goſpel; but he ſhall receive an hundred-fold now in this time, houſes, and brethren, and ſiſters, and mothers, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and lands, with perſecutions; and in the life to come, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi> Theſe and ſuch-like promiſes, reſpecting this life, or that which is to come; muſt be juſtified, and ſo juſtified, that the world may take notice, that God is true to them; which cannot
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:192227:217"/>be, unleſs God to ſome ſuch ſervants of his, ſhould diſpenſe out quick and preſent rewards.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. On the other ſide, it is but reaſonable, that God ſhould preſently reward the ſervices that wicked men do him: <hi>Becauſe there is no portion provided for them in that life which is to come;</hi> neither can they truſt God for the life to come: all they look at is preſent pay, and reward. Thus I have opened to you this Obſervation in the Doctrinal part of it, and ſhewed you the reaſonableneſs of theſe motions of Divine Providence. I come now to the application; which I ſhall ſhortly diſpatch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> This Obſervation affords us a new, and potent argument. 1. <hi>To perſwade ſinners from preſumptuous ſinnings.</hi> 2. <hi>To engage men to more eminent ſervices and ſufferings for God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay, firſt, <hi>To diſſwade ſinners from preſumptuous ſinnings againſt God.</hi> The flow motions of Divine Providence, as to the puniſhment of ſinners, as I told you, do much incourage ſinners to go on in their courſes of ſin; the hearts of ſinners are ſet in them to do evil, <hi>becauſe judgement is not executed ſpeedily.</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to diſcourage and check this preſumption in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obſervation; where I confirmed to you, that by how much the more ſlowly vindicative juſtice proceedeth to the puniſhment of ſin, by ſo much ſeverer the puniſhment is when it cometh. This Obſervation addeth further to that check; for, as that which men call ſlackneſs, is but the long ſuffering and patience of God, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould be ſaved by a ſeaſonable repentance. So (as you have now heard at large diſcourſed to you) neither is God thus long-ſuffering, and patient with all: and although God generally be more quick with thoſe ſorts of ſinners, which I have ſpecified to you; yet I deſire you to obſerve what I firſt enlarged upon, that there is hardly any kind or ſort of ſinners, but God at ſome time or other hath picked out ſome or other of them, to make them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of his ſeverity, Thou maiſt be ſtruck dead, while the lye is in thy mouth. It was the caſe you know of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> Thou maiſt be cut off in the very Act of Adultery, (It was the caſe, you know, of <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi).</hi> Tremble there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and <hi>do not ſin,</hi> God may grant thee many years of patience, he may give thee leave <hi>to treaſure up wrath to thy ſelf againſt the day of wrath;</hi> but thou canſt not promiſe thy ſelf an hours pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:192227:217"/>But above all, fear thoſe ſins which God uſually is ſo quick in puniſhing. <hi>Fear blaſpheming God,</hi> or the <hi>King;</hi> we live in a blaſpheming age, wherein have been more bold darings of God, than in former times. God hath revenged his glory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome of them, they have been cut off in their youth, before they have lived out half their dayes. If another generation ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up, and approveth their ſayings, wait but a while, and you will ſee vengeance overtaking them alſo. Fear doing any thing againſt the life of others, who by the law of God ought not to dye. Blood-thirſty men ſhall not live out half their days, you fee Gods vengeance againſt this ſin is very quick.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Obſervation affords a great encouragement to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, eſpecially to <hi>eminent actings, and ſufferings for God.</hi> There is a reward for righteous men, if they go without it to their dying day; yet they ſhall be recompenſed in the generation of the juſt. Heaven will pay for all; but God doth not always take ſo long a day to recompence them. Many have a reward in this life, and that which is to come. The Scripture is full of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, even of the good things of this life, to <hi>godlineſs</hi> in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and to the ſeveral parts, and acts of godlineſs. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes indeed are not made good to every child of God, in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> but only in equivalent, yea tranſcendent mercies. But even theſe promiſes are made good to many; and they may be thy portion, however thou ſhalt not miſs of the greater things. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this layeth an engagement upon all that fear God, as God calleth them to it, and giveth them advantage for it to ſignalize themſelves, by eminent actings, or by ſome eminent ſufferings: ſuch you have heard God ordinarily payeth preſently; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that eternal recompence which they have in glory, they are in more outward, and ſenſible things, or in more inward influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of grace recompenſed in this life. Thoſe that eminently ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, he will honour; and many of them have a double meſs ſent them from the Lord.</p>

                  <p>I Am proceeding yet in my Obſervations, upon the motions of Divine Providence (that which we call Actual Providence) in its adminiſtration of diſtributive Juſtice, both in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinners, and the rewarding of the righteous. Divers Obſervations I have already made, I am come to the,</p>
                  <p>Obſervat. 18. (Which you may pleaſe to take thus) <hi>That the Providence of God, doth very ordinarily, with the puniſhments of this life, chaſtiſe the paſt, and pardoned ſins of people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of which, I ſhall, 1. <hi>Juſtifie the Obſervation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall <hi>ſhew you the reaſonableneſs of this motion of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and reconcile it, both to the juſtice and goodneſs of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, I ſhall make ſome practical application of it. That it is ſo, I ſhall prove by two famous inſtances: the firſt of <hi>David,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Job. David,</hi> you know, had fallen into two grievous ſins, <hi>Adultery</hi> with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and the murther of her Husband <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> God ſendeth the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. to <hi>David</hi> to convince him of his ſin, who doth it by a Parable. <hi>Davids</hi> heart melteth, <hi>v.</hi> 13. and he ſaith unto <hi>Nathan, I have ſinned againſt the Lord. Nathan</hi> tells him, <hi>the Lord hath alſo put away thy ſin.</hi> The ſin you ſee was both paſt, and pardoned, but mark what follows; v. 14. <hi>Howbeit, becauſe by this deed thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven great occaſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, the Child alſo that is born unto thee ſhall ſurely dye.</hi> He had told him before, v. 10. <hi>That the ſword ſhould not depart from his houſe:</hi> and v. 11. <hi>That he would take his wives before his face, and give them to his neighbour, and he ſhould ly with them in the ſight of the Sun.</hi> All this was afterward juſtified by the Actual Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:192227:218"/>of God. The <hi>Child died,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Amnon</hi> deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Siſter <hi>Thamar,</hi> and is ſlain by her Brother <hi>Abſolon:</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.14, 29. <hi>Abſalom, Davids</hi> own Son, lieth with his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Concubines, in the ſight of all Iſrael.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> is ſlain in a rebellion againſt his Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus, but God puniſheth <hi>David</hi> with horrors and terrors in his mind, with diſeaſes in his body, as you may gather from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. and the reſt of thoſe <hi>Pſalms,</hi> in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth his <hi>repentance. David</hi> prayeth Pſal. 25.7. <hi>Remember not the ſins of my youth, nor my tranſgreſſions. Job</hi> complaineth unto God, Job. 7.2, 3. <hi>As a ſervant earneſtly deſireth the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work; ſo am I made to poſſeſs months of vanity.</hi> I know the words are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of another ſenſe; as vanity may be underſtood for affliction and miſery, or the fruſtration of his expectations; but I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpret it by the words of the ſame <hi>Job</hi> 13.26, 27, 28. <hi>For thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſs the ſins of my youth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Moſes, and Aaron</hi> ſinned againſt the Lord at the waters of <hi>Meribah:</hi> I do not think that any of you doubt, but that God pardoned their ſin; yet it is certain that God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them, and that for that ſin; God himſelf tells them ſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.50, 51. That the Providence of God doth this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing may ſeem to have more difficulty in it, <hi>viz. How this is reconcileable, either to the juſtice, or goodneſs of God. To his juſtice who hath accepted a price, and ſatisfaction for them at the hand of his Son; concerning whom he hath ſaid, that in him</hi> (as our Mediator) <hi>he was well pleaſed.</hi> How then can God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n and women for thoſe ſins, for which he hath accepted a price, and ſatisfaction. <hi>Or how is this reconcileable to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Gods pardoning grace?</hi> How are thoſe ſins pardoned, which God afterward puniſheth.</p>
                  <p>But this Cavil proceedeth upon a double miſtake or error.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt <hi>concerning the puniſhments of ſin</hi> upon the Children of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond <hi>concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſts death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the firſt it ſuppoſeth, <hi>that the afflictions and puniſhments of Gods people, are all for ſatisfaction;</hi> which if it were ſo, they were of all men mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>, a, their afflictions do ordinarily more abound, than the afflictions of others. It is true, that the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:192227:219"/>and irreconciled ſinner, hath no reaſon to look upon any affliction otherwiſe, than as an arreſt of divine vengeance; upon every ague, every feaver, as Gods taking him by the throat, and ſaying to him, <hi>Pay me now what thou oweſt;</hi> becauſe they cannot apprehend any ſuch thing, as that Chriſt hath for them ſatisfied Divine Juſtice: but the caſe is otherwiſe with a believer. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our afflictions and puniſhments of this nature, theſe two things would follow from them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A Chriſtian ſhould never be able to ſee to the bottom of his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cup,</hi> were ſatisfaction to be given by us, when could we ſo much as hope to ſay? All is finiſhed. We might burn, but when could we hope to come out of the flames? we might be paying, and paying; but when could we think to have paid the uttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Satisfaction in our perſons muſt be an endleſs work, the offended Juſtice being no leſs than infinite.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We could never hope by our afflictions to be made gainers in grace.</hi> If it were poſſible for us to apprehend, that by our ſuffering we could make full payment to the Juſtice of God, yet we could have no hope by affliction, to grow more holy: no man groweth richer, by parting with money to pay his debts; none could hope by afflictions, to grow more holy, that his affliction ſhould purge away his droſs, or take away his tin, or he by them be made more conformable to the Image of his bleſſed Saviour, if our afflictions were for ſatisfaction. But the holy Scripture giveth us quite another notion of afflictions, ſo far as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the People of God; it bottometh them in <hi>Divine Love,</hi> it calleth them <hi>chaſtenings,</hi> and calleth them <hi>fatherly corrections,</hi> Heb. 12.6, 7, 8. We are bid <hi>not to deſpiſe the chaſtening of the Almighty;</hi> we are told, <hi>That they are bleſſed, whom he chaſteneth, and teacheth out of his law;</hi> we are told, <hi>that he chaſteneth whom he loveth, and ſcourgeth every child whom he receiveth.</hi> Now it is true, ſatisfaction is not conſiſtent with the <hi>ſatisfaction of Chriſt;</hi> but <hi>corrections</hi> and <hi>fatherly chaſtiſements,</hi> are conſiſtent enough with the price which Chriſt hath paid, and the ſatisfaction which he hath given for us; hanging the malefactor, or otherwiſe put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to death, is not conſiſtent with pardon; but I hope, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him, branding, ſending him a while to Bridewel, baniſhment of him when he deſerved death, is conſiſtent enough with it. The Papiſts indeed fancy that Chriſt hath only ſatisfied for the eternal puniſhment, but ſtill we are bound to ſatisfie by temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:192227:219"/>Hence are their penances and purgatory founded, but that is a very uncomfortable notion; and the more we look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, the more dreadful it will appear. On the other ſide the <hi>Antinomians</hi> are as much almoſt on the other hand, denying the <hi>afflictions</hi> of Gods People, to be <hi>puniſhment of ſins</hi> or <hi>judgments,</hi> when the Scripture ſo calls them. The truth lyes in the middle betwixt theſe two extreams, they are <hi>judgments,</hi> they are <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſin,</hi> but they are <hi>no legal demands of ſatisfaction,</hi> nor giving ſatisfaction. Chriſt hath ſatisfied for the whole guilt of their ſins, for whom he died. All of that nature as to them was <hi>finiſhed upon the croſs:</hi> ſo that the afflictions of the People of God, their puniſhments for ſin, have now both another name and notion, than ſatisfactions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond miſtake upon which this objection is founded, is, <hi>That Chriſt by his death paid a price into the hands of his fathers juſtice for all temporal puniſhments due to man for ſin, ſo as to excuſe thoſe for whom he died, from them.</hi> Now as to this, whatſoever we may fancy,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is manifeſt, <hi>that our Lord Jeſus never did purchaſe for his people any ſuch thing as a freedom from temporal death, and the ſmart of bodily afflictions.</hi> He hath taken away <hi>the ſting of death,</hi> but not <hi>death;</hi> he hath delivered us from the curſe, but not from the croſs. This is all which the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>He hath redeemed us from the curſe, by being made a curſe for us:</hi> himſelf hath told us, <hi>That if any one will be his diſciple, he muſt deny himſelf, and take up the croſs and follow him:</hi> And we are told by the Apoſtle, <hi>That all who will live godlily in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi> And accordingly the ſervants of God have experienced it, even <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was in deaths often, and had his thorn in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor was it any branch of that Covenant of <hi>Redemption and Grace, in which Chriſt was a party with, or a ſurety to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal father.</hi> I put in thoſe two terms <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi> I know ſome make two Covenants; the one they call <hi>the Covenant of Redemption,</hi> the other the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and that there are very different notions of the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> For my own part, I ſee no need of aſſerting more than one Covenant, and that eternal, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. This I take to be a paction from eternity, made betwixt the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>eternal Father,</hi> on the one part; and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt on the other, wherein Chriſt Covenanted with his Father, <hi>that he would do his whole will for the redemption of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:192227:220"/>his choſen ones,</hi> Pſal. 40.7. Heb. 10.7. and that we by grace derived from him, <hi>ſhould do what the father requires of us in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our ſalvation,</hi> in reſpect of which he is ſaid to be made <hi>the ſurety of a better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 7.22. The Father mutually Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted with his Son, that he would be well-pleaſed in him, that he would give him the ſouls for whom he ſhould dye, that he might give them eternal life, and all that grace and good which ſhould be advantageous for them; but neither did Chriſt ask of his Father, neither did his Father promiſe him on their behalf an immunity from temporal puniſhments, afflictions, or chaſtiſements for ſin. We cannot underſtand the terms of the Covenant of Grace, but from the <hi>Exhibition</hi> of it in Scripture, which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry various, ſometimes more clearly, ſometimes more darkly, to <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham, David,</hi> &amp;c. One of the faireſt copies of it, I think is that to <hi>David,</hi> which we have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. from the 20, to the 35. <hi>v.</hi> Verſ. 28. he tells him, <hi>That he will keep his mercy with him for evermore, and his covenant ſhould ſtand faſt with him:</hi> but yet he reſerveth himſelf a liberty to puniſh him and his ſeed for ſins: <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. <hi>If his children for ſake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my ſtatutes, and keep not my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, then will I viſit their tranſgreſſions with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes: nevertheleſs my loving-kindneſs I will not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail: my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</hi> So that notwithſtanding the Covenant of Grace for eternal life, and pardon of ſin, and all grace in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of this life, and notwithſtanding the blood of Chriſt, which was the <hi>blood of this Covenant;</hi> God hath yet a liberty to viſit the <hi>tranſgreſſions of his people,</hi> even their paſt, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing tranſgreſſions with rods, <hi>and their iniquity with ſtripes:</hi> yet he doth not break his Covenant, nor alter any thing that is gone out of his lips.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor is it reaſonable that any ſhould fancy, that God by the eſtabliſhment of the Covenant of Grace, or by acceptance of the ſatisfaction of his Son, as the blood of this Covenant to make an atonement and reconciliation for iniquity, ſhould have barred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his liberty to puniſh the ſins of his people: or that any who hath <hi>accepted this Covenant upon the exhibition of it in the Goſpel, ſhould be excuſed from ſuch chaſtiſements; if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:192227:220"/>1. <hi>That ſome of theſe chaſtenings are made the matters of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> Mark 10.30. Perſecutions are reckoned amongſt Chriſts rewards in this life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every child whom he receiveth,</hi> &amp;c. Thence the ancients were wont to call Martyrdom a Crown; and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was wont to complain, <hi>That God would not honour him to wear that Crown.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth to be <hi>made conformable to the death of Chriſt;</hi> if the Saints did not fight, how could they triumph? how ſhould they conquer? yea be more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querers?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That afflictions are the path-way to death, and death the door into eternal life.</hi> Every affliction is a blow at the root of our tree, preparing it for its fall; and if we did not dye, how ſhould we live in Heaven? We muſt all dye, or be changed; or our corruptible could never put on incorruption, nor our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal put on immortality. It is reported of <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> a lawgiver amongſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> that he ſhould ſay, If God had not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all ſhould dye, it had been reaſonable for men to have made a law in the caſe: and we read of ſome <hi>Indians,</hi> who being asked why they worſhipped the Sun, gave this reaſon, <hi>Becauſe it was the Author of death.</hi> Give me leave to ſay, That <hi>death</hi> is ſo neceſſary, and afflictions are ſo wholeſom for Chriſtians, that they deſerve rather to be reckoned amongſt thoſe things which Chriſt hath purchaſed for them, than ſuch things as he hath purchaſed them a liberty from.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>All ſorts of afflictions of this life, are means of grace;</hi> not ſo much means of begetting, as reviving, and increaſing grace: for as the fire <hi>ſoftneth the wax, and hardneth the clay;</hi> ſo I have uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obſerved, <hi>That afflictions make the wicked man worſe, but godly men better;</hi> they revive repentance, they are times when uſually men call ſin to remembrance, they draw out the exerciſes of faith, and both work and exerciſe patience. <hi>Tribulation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>worketh patience, and patience experience, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hope. David, before that he was afflicted, went aſtray,</hi> after he learned to keep Gods Statutes. God while he puniſheth his people for their ſins, doth not barely chaſten them, but he alſo teacheth them out of his Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They (ſecondly) <hi>prepare the Saints for glory;</hi> and this not only as they reſtrain ſin, and tend to perfect grace; but as it pleaſeth God of his grace to reward the ſufferings of his people,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:192227:221"/>and the faith and patience of his people ſhewed in and under their ſufferings with the greater glory. Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>That our light and momentany afflictions work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> And thus much may ſerve to have cleared this Objection, that I may haſten to the practical Application of this Obſervation. This motion of Divine Providence in puniſhing with temporal puniſhments, paſt, and pardoned ſins, even in the beſt of Gods People, appears exceeding reaſonable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of the Juſtice of God.</hi> The Juſtice of God having taken a ſatisfaction in the blood of his Son, and been paid a price for the ſins of his people, will not allow him to puniſh them with an eternal puniſhment; yet it is reaſonable they ſhould not go altogether unpuniſhed, that the world may ſee that he is a God of purer eyes than to behold iniquity in any. I remember what God ſaid by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to the <hi>Jews, Jer.</hi> 30.11. <hi>I will not make a full end of thee, but I will correct thee in meaſure, and will not leave thee altogether unpuniſhed.</hi> You have the ſame again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is reaſonable (ſecondly) <hi>in order to the eternal ſalvation of their ſouls,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.32. <hi>When we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi> It is <hi>P. Martyrs</hi> note upon that Text, that the Apoſtle in that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage particularly reſpecteth ſuch as fear God; for the caſe is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with wicked men, whoſe puniſhment but begun in this life, ſhall be perfected in the world that is to come. But I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken enough to the Doctrinal part of this Obſervation. Let me now come to ſome practical Obſervation, ſhewing you what uſe we may and ought to make of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This in the firſt place ſerves to <hi>juſtifie God in thoſe ſore afflictions which we often ſee him bringing upon his own people.</hi> When we look upon the holineſs of a <hi>Job,</hi> and ſee him a man <hi>fearing God, and eſchewing evil,</hi> and ſee ſuch a perſon under ſharp tryals of affliction, we are ready to ſtartle at it, and cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Divine Juſtice in it. But God is many ways to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. 1. <hi>Who liveth and ſinneth not enough againſt God,</hi> to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſevereſt diſpenſations under which God exerciſeth him?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>If he did not, yet it is an ordinary thing, and very righteous for God, to write bitter things againſt his people for the ſins of their
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:192227:221"/>youth,</hi> though paſt and pardoned. Now who hath ſo paſſed his youth, that he hath not been guilty of ſin enough to juſtifie God in his puniſhments, yea and to make him acknowledg that he hath been puniſhed ſeven times leſs than he hath deſerved. And if neither of theſe could be ſeen as a meritorious cauſe, yet God hath a liberty by afflictions, to <hi>try the faith and patience of his people,</hi> (but that is not the ſubject of my preſent diſcourſe). I remember when they asked our Saviour concerning him that was born blind, whether it were for <hi>his own ſin,</hi> or <hi>for his parents:</hi> Our Saviour replys, for neither, but that the glory of God might appear. So I doubt not but Gods end in afflicting his people, is neither at all times the puniſhment of the perſons late ſins, nor former ſins, but that both the grace and glory of God might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſtrengthning, ſupporting, and upholding of his poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that he might be glorified by them in the fires, by the exerciſe of their faith and patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. This ſpeaketh loud to all, eſpecially to young men, <hi>to take heed of preſumptuous ſinnings againſt God. Preſumption of mercy</hi> is that which much enticeth out the luſts of our hearts: there are ſome that will fancy God an Idol of mercy, and will ſay, Let them do what they liſt, yet it ſhall be well with them; they will not believe any ſuch thing as Hell, or a Revelation of the wrath of God againſt ſinners. God did not make them to damn them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God of old foreſaw there would be a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that when <hi>they heard the words of his curſe, would bleſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their hearts, ſaying, They ſhould have peace, although they walked after the imaginations of their own hearts, adding drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thirſt,</hi> Deut. 29.19. Obſerve, <hi>v.</hi> 20. what God ſaith as to ſuch, <hi>The Lord will not ſpare him, but the anger of the Lord and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this book ſhall lye upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under heaven,</hi> &amp;c. But bleſſed be God there are not many of theſe in the age wherein we live, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but will acknowledg an Heaven and an Hell, and profeſs to believe, that there is a reward for the righteous, and for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, for the Saint, and for the ſinner. So that what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth the moſt of men in ſinful courſes, is not any hope of a total and final impunity, but a preſumption of pardon, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining mercy with God before they dye. They are taught by
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:192227:222"/>ſome wild teachers, that it is in the power of man to repent, to believe, to turn to God when he pleaſeth; and this imboldneth them to out-ſtare all the terrors of the Lord, and to put off all the tenders of the Goſpel, to indulge their luſts, and to ſay, It is not yet time to turn unto God: if they obtain pardon at laſt, they ſhall be well enough; if they turn to God (and they are told they can do it when they pleaſe), it is but taking up a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in their old age, when they have had the fill of their luſts in their youth. Now if this Doctrine had any truth in it, it would quite deſtroy an old argument we had to preſs men to a ſpeedy repentance; becauſe that God, who always giveth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to them who truly repent, <hi>will not always give unto ſinners an heart to repent.</hi> No need of that, ſay our new Teachers, man hath a <hi>freedom in his own will,</hi> he may repent whenſoever he can but get himſelf of the mind; he labours under no more than a <hi>moral impotency,</hi> his luſts are ſo ſtrong, that he cannot obtain leave of himſelf; that is all. But friend, admit this were true, that thou hadſt repentance in thy own hand, and that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt upon thy repentance obtain pardon of thy ſins from God; yet God may as to the puniſhments of this life make thee go mourning to thy grave for the ſins of thy youth: he may plague thee in thy own perſon, and plague thee in thy poſterity; God had pardoned <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, <hi>Nathan</hi> told him, <hi>The Lord had put away his iniquity, yet the child dyed, the ſword never departed from his houſe. Abſolom</hi> requited him by going into his Concubines in the ſight of the Sun; he was weary with his groaning, all the night long, he made his bed to ſwim, and watered his couch with his tears, his eyes were conſumed with grief, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. <hi>His bones waxed old through his roaring all the day-long: Gods hand was heavy upon him night and day, ſo as his moiſture was turned into the drought of ſummer,</hi> Pſal. 32. Who would not fear ſuch kind of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations? Alas! there is no ſuch thing as mans having a power in himſelf to repent and turn to God. <hi>Can the Blackamore change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots?</hi> Everywhit as ſoon as he who is accuſtomed to do evil, can do well; but admit you could, I ſay it is a thouſand to one but God in the puniſhments of this life will viſit your youth-ſins upon you: young men that are wiſe, will take heed of wounds and ſtrains in their youth, or <hi>ſurfeits,</hi> which though they feel little of in the heat of their youth, they will be ſure enough to feel in their bones when old age overtaketh
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:192227:222"/>them; and certainly, if ſenſual ſinners would give but their reaſon leave to guide them, it would guide them alſo to take heed of thoſe ſins in their youth; for which they may ſo ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmart, by wounds, and terrors of Conſcience; by doubts, and horrors, and fears; by diſeaſes, and other kind of puniſhments: there is a great deal of difference, betwixt being ſaved ſmoothly, and a being ſaved but <hi>through fire.</hi> O let me plead with you, who have little elſe to ſay, for the cares and pains of your youth, but that by it you are but providing quiet and reſt for your ſelves when you come to be old; that you would admit the force of that Argument alſo to perſwade you to <hi>remember your Creator in the days of your youth;</hi> and to take heed of the ſins of youth, which God often ſo ſeverely puniſheth upon gray-hairs, yea and that to his own people, whoſe iniquities yet he hath pardoned, ſo as they ſhall not eternally condemn him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 3. But (that I may ſhut up this diſcourſe) what you have heard upon this Obſervation, may <hi>offer the beſt of us,</hi> ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which poſſibly, we have not thought of; both of <hi>daily hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and particular humiliation, when the rod of God is upon us.</hi> I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Of daily repentance, and humiliation.</hi> We are ready to ſpeak after the language of <hi>Agag</hi> (whom <hi>Saul</hi> had ſpared upon the ſlaughter of the <hi>Amalekites</hi>) <hi>ſurely the bitterneſs of death is paſt.</hi> If we find that God hath changed our hearts, that we are not what we were; we are very prone to think, that all the follies, and vanities of our youth are forgotten. But let us not miſtake, God ſealeth up the ſins of impenitent ſinners in a bag, for to be brought forth to their eternal ruine, in the day of the revelation of Gods wrath: he ſealeth up the ſins of his redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones in a bag, to chaſten them oft-times in this life, with the rods and ſtripes of men. God <hi>wrought bitter things againſt</hi> Job, <hi>for the ſins of his youth:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſaw reaſon to pray, that the Lord would not <hi>remember the ſins of his youth againſt him.</hi> We ſtand therefore deeply concerned, with bitterneſs, to remember what God hath not ſo forgotten, but he may deeply chaſtiſe us for. O, then my Brethren, let us all look back upon our youth, and mourn over that firſt, and wanton time! And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the hand of God is upon us; and it may be we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find wherefore he contendeth us; then let us remember for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:192227:223"/>ſins, and humble our ſouls before the Lord for them; and glorifie God in the fires, by acknowledging the righteouſneſs of God in the puniſhment of the ſins of our former years. But poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſome will ſay to me, <hi>What is to be done in this caſe?</hi> is there no way to prevent this after-reckoning with us?</p>
                  <p>Truly I cannot promiſe you there is, for as a <hi>people may be grown</hi> in ſin to ſuch an height, that there is no ſpeaking to God for them; ſo it is poſſible, that our former ſins may have ſo provoked God, as notwithſtanding our repentance and converſion, God may be reſolved, that we ſhall ſmart in the fleſh, though our ſouls be ſaved in the day of Chriſt; but if there be any hope for ſuch a mercy, it is certainly to be obtained.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By <hi>frequent humiliations for paſt ſins,</hi> much faſting and prayer: thus <hi>Joſiah</hi> obtained mercy, as to his perſon, when the ſins of his predeceſſors, were coming like a ſtorm upon him. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> knew that if any thing would do, this was the way; and therefore while the <hi>child was ſick, he humbled himſelf, and would eat no bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>By ſhewing your ſelves eminent in</hi> the exerciſe of thoſe <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> which <hi>are moſt oppoſed to your former ſins.</hi> This was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> counſel to the King; he had ſinned by <hi>unrighteouſneſs,</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and <hi>injuſtice;</hi> oppreſſing his ſubjects, griping the poor, <hi>&amp;c. Daniel</hi> adviſeth him, to <hi>break off his ſins by righteouſneſs,</hi> and his iniquities, <hi>by ſhewing mercy to the poor, if it might be a lengthning out of his tranquillity,</hi> Dan. 4.27. He could not aſſure him this would be a <hi>lengthning out of his tranquillity;</hi> but if it were a thing to be done, this was the way to obtain it. <hi>Paul</hi> had eminently ſinned, by <hi>blaſpheming,</hi> perſecuting the Lord Chriſt in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: he preacheth up Chriſt, and laboureth in the work of the Goſpel more than all the reſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Walk humbly</hi> (in the third place) <hi>with thy God;</hi> do not be too cenſorious, too raſh in thy judgement; God reſiſteth the proud: thou wert once as others are; it is <hi>by Grace</hi> thou art otherwiſe. Now it cannot be pleaſing, but highly provocative to God; to ſee a great ſinner, whom he hath pardoned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to mercy, triumphing over, judging, cenſuring them; and doubtleſs doth often provoke God to call their former ſins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that they may learn to pity others. It is ſeldom that God by ſmart judgements makes them ſenſible of their errors, who have a daily ſenſe of them; and in the ſenſe of them, walk
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:192227:223"/>ſoftly all the days of their lives. <hi>If we would judg our ſelves</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31.) <hi>we ſhould not be judged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be much in ſecret prayer to God, begging of him, <hi>That if it be poſſible, thoſe bitter cups might paſs from thee;</hi> but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to add what our Saviour addeth; <hi>yet not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> For theſe puniſhments are not in themſelves evil, and therefore not abſolutely to be deprecated; but with ſubmiſſion to the will, and wiſdom of God.</p>

                  <p>That the thing is true, appeareth from ſo plentiful a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Scripture-inſtances; as hardly any thing is more clear, and that both as to <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments.</hi> I will begin with the firſt, but ſhall be ſhorter in that Diſcourſe; becauſe the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lieth more as to the ſecond thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſtribution of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</p>
                  <p>Now for <hi>Rewards,</hi> beſides many particular inſtances, we have two that are more general; thoſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the faithful, and <hi>David,</hi> the man according to Gods own heart. They were both great, and common Fathers. <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Father of the Jewiſh Nation: The father of <hi>many Nations,</hi> and the <hi>father of the faithful.</hi> I ſhall only conſider him in the firſt capacity. <hi>David</hi> was the father of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> (<hi>Sauls</hi> family, you know, was extinguiſhed preſently): Now how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in Scripture, do you find God declaring his goodneſs, and mercy to the Jewiſh Nation, for his ſervant <hi>Abrahams ſake;</hi> or for the ſake of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> or for his ſervant <hi>Davids</hi> ſake! <hi>And God heard their groaning, and God remembred his Covenant, with Abraham, and with Iſaac, and with Jacob,</hi> Exod. 2.24. Lev. 26.42. <hi>Then will I remember my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Jacob, and alſo my Covenant with Iſaac; and alſo my Covenant with Abraham will I remember, and I will remember the Land.</hi> Hence it was that the Jews gloried ſo much, that <hi>They had Abraham to their Father:</hi> and the faithful amongſt them ordinarily uſed it, as an argument to plead in prayer with God for them. It is plain concerning <hi>David,</hi> from a multitude of Scriptures, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.11. God threatning to <hi>rend away the Kingdom of Solomon,</hi> tells him, that for <hi>David his ſervants ſake, he will not do it in his days;</hi> and v. 12. <hi>For David his ſervants ſake, he would give one tribe to his Son.</hi> So again, <hi>v.</hi> 32, 34. and 2 Kings 8.19. <hi>Yet the Lord</hi> would not deſtroy <hi>Judah</hi> for <hi>Davids</hi> ſake. 2 Kings 19.34. <hi>I will defend this City, ſave it for my own ſake, and for my ſervant Davids ſake;</hi> hence the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prayeth, Pſal. 132.10. <hi>For thy ſervant Davids ſake, turn not away the face of thine Anointed,</hi> and ſo in many other texts of Scripture. The caſe as to puniſhments, hath yet a far more plentiful evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from holy Writ, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.8, 9. <hi>Amalek</hi> ſmote <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> God revengeth this ſin upon their children, and poſterity. More than 350 years after, God ſaith to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.2, 3. Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>I
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:192227:224"/>remember that which Amalek did, how he laid wait for them in the way, when he came out of Egypt. Now go ſmite Amalek, and utterly deſtroy all that they have; and ſpare them not, but ſlay both man, and woman, and infant, and ſuckling; both Ox and Sheep, and Camel, and Aſs.</hi> God in the ſecond Commandment ſaith, that he is a <hi>jealous God, viſiting the iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third, and fourth generation;</hi> and conformable unto this, is the whole revelation of the will of God in Scripture, and the diſpenſation of Actual Providence. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.11. God threatneth to rend the Kingdom away from <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Foraſmuch as this is done of thee, and thou haſt not kept my ſtatutes, which I have commanded thee.</hi> v. 12. <hi>Notwithſtanding, in thy days I will not do it, for David thy Fathers ſake; but I will rend it out of the hand of thy Son;</hi> he accordingly did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> you know, had the part God rent from the houſe of <hi>David.</hi> He ſetteth up idolatry. God threatneth, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.9. that becauſe of this, he would deſtroy <hi>Jeroboams</hi> houſe; and cut off from him, <hi>him that piſſed againſt the wall, and would take away the remnant of the houſe of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung till it be gone.</hi> Now obſerve, how the Actual Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God fulfils this, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.25. <hi>Nadab, Jeroboams</hi> ſon ſucceedeth; he reigneth but two years; <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>Baaſh conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth againſt him, ſmiteth him, and ſlayeth him;</hi> v. 29. <hi>He ſmote all the houſe of Jeroboam;</hi> he left not to <hi>Jeroboam</hi> any that brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed until he had deſtroyed him. v. 30. <hi>Becauſe of the ſins of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam which he ſinned, and which he made Iſrael to ſin, by his Provocation, wherewith he provoked the Lord God of Iſrael to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> The phraſe is not excluſive of <hi>Nadabs</hi> ſins; but it plainly proveth, that in <hi>Nadab,</hi> and the reſt of his families puniſhment, there was a ſpecial conſideration of <hi>Jeroboams ſins: Baaſha</hi> doth as wickedly as <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> God ſends <hi>Jehu</hi> the Prophet, who threatneth him, that the Lord would take away his poſterity, <hi>and the poſterity of his houſe; and make his houſe, like the houſe of Jeroboam, the ſon of Nebat,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.1, 2, 3. He reigned 24 years. <hi>Elah</hi> his ſon ſucceeds him, and reigneth two years, as bad a man as his Father, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.8, 9, 10. <hi>Zimri,</hi> one of his Captains ſlayeth him, being drunk. <hi>v.</hi> 11. the ſame <hi>Zimri,</hi> ſlayeth <hi>all the houſe of Baaſha; he left him not one who piſſed againſt the wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor friends.</hi> And this <hi>v.</hi> 13. was for all the <hi>ſins of Baaſha. Omri</hi> ſets up againſt <hi>Zimri,</hi>
                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:192227:225"/>and prevaileth; he reigneth 12 years: <hi>Ahab</hi> was his ſon, who reigned 22 years. He was a moſt vile man, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.25. <hi>There was none like unto Ahab;</hi> which did ſell himſelf to work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ſight of the Lord. God in the ſame Chapter, v. 21. threatned him, becauſe <hi>he had ſold himſelf to work evil in the ſight of the Lord, that he would bring evil upon him, and take away his poſterity; and would cut off from Ahab, him that piſſed againſt the wall, and him that was ſhut up, and left in Iſrael; and would make his houſe like the houſe of Jeroboam, the ſon of Nebat, and like the houſe of Baaſha.</hi> In the next Chapter you ſhall read that <hi>Ahab</hi> was killed in the battle at <hi>Ramoth Gilead. Ahaziah ſucceedeth him,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.40. <hi>Ahaziah</hi> dieth an untimely death, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by a fall from a window; 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. and <hi>Jehoram</hi> his ſon ſucceedeth: <hi>v.</hi> 17. he was ſlain by <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. ch. 10. <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſons</hi> more of his were ſlain by the men of <hi>Samaria,</hi> at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Jehu.</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 17. When he came to <hi>Samaria,</hi> he ſlew all that remained to <hi>Ahab</hi> in <hi>Samaria, till he had deſtroyed him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of the Lord, which he ſpake to Elijah. Jehu</hi> ſucceedeth in the Kingdom, he ſlew the Prieſts, and worſhippers of <hi>Baal;</hi> and turned the houſe of <hi>Baal</hi> into a <hi>draught-houſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.25, 26, 27, 28. For this God rewardeth both him and his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with a Crown and a Throne, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.30. But he yet kept up the idolatry of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.29. for this, God not only puniſhed him, in his life time, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.32, 33. <hi>But threatens to avenge the blood of Jeſreel upon the houſe of Jehu. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> 1.4. which came to paſs an hundred years after, in the fourth Generation. <hi>Jehoahaz Jehu's</hi> ſon reigned 17 years. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh</hi> his ſon reigned 16 years. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> his ſon reigned 41 years, which added to 28 years <hi>Jehu</hi> reigned, makes a 102 years. Now you know, the ſervice <hi>Jehu</hi> did, was in the beginning of his reign. Thus you ſee this was Gods conſtant courſe of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with the ſeveral families of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For the ſin of <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.27. <hi>God threatneth him, that becauſe he had honoured his ſons above God.</hi> v. 29. <hi>He would cut off his arm, and the arm of his fathers houſe; that there ſhould not be an old man in his houſe.</hi> v. 33. <hi>And all the increaſe of his houſe ſhould die in the flower of their age.</hi> Chriſt bids thoſe that mourned for him, <hi>to weep for themſelves, and their children.</hi> In ſhort, the proof of this is very full from Scripture. And we ſhall find this done, not only in <hi>natural Relates</hi> and <hi>Correlates;</hi> Such are Fathers
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:192227:225"/>and Children, of which I have given you plentiful inſtances; but in ſuch as are <hi>moral Relations.</hi> Sometimes we ſhall <hi>find the people puniſhed</hi> for the <hi>Rulers ſin.</hi> Thus it was in the caſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, he numbred the people,</hi> the people were plagued for it. So in the caſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Baaſha,</hi> and <hi>Ahab;</hi> they ſet up their idolatry; the people were deſtroyed, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 5.11. <hi>Ephraim is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and broken in judgement, becauſe he willingly walked after the Commandment,</hi> (a Text worth the ſtudying by many Divines in our age). The famine in <hi>Davids</hi> time, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1. came for <hi>Saul,</hi> and his bloody houſe; and ten of his ſons muſt be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attone God. Again, you ſhall find it done, when the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal guilt was in the people:</hi> this was the caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they made <hi>the Golden-calf, Exod.</hi> 32.22. And when they murmured, at the report brought up by the Spies, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.33. The judgement extended to near 40 years. This is a tremendous motion of Providence, it may not therefore be out of my way to enquire,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What ſins thoſe are, which God doth ordinarily thus revenge on Correlates?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>How far this Vengeance doth extend?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>How this is reconcileable to the juſtice and goodneſs of God, and the revelation of his will?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, it is hard to ſay, <hi>what ſins God may not thus revenge. Eli</hi> was thus (as you have heard) puniſhed in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, for not duly <hi>puniſhing his Sons; David</hi> for <hi>numbring the people:</hi> but the more eminent ſins, which you read of in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture thus puniſhed, are;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Corruption in the worſhip of God,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Idolatry,</hi> (which is the higheſt ſin in that kind) This is verified in the inſtance of the puniſhment, for the <hi>Calf</hi> made by <hi>Aaron</hi> at the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. and in all the caſes of the <hi>Kings of Iſrael,</hi> before mentioned. Princes were puniſhed for it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſonally, but in their families; and the people too, <hi>for willingly walking after the commandment.</hi> The worſhip of God is a very tender thing; and God more ſeverely puniſheth no ſin, than he doth corruptions in that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Blood, Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>blood of righteous men.</hi> God <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. commands that no <hi>ſatisfaction ſhould be taken for the life of the murderer;</hi> he tells us there, <hi>blood pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a land, and ſo, as that it cannot be cleanſed, but by the blood
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:192227:226"/>of him that ſhed it.</hi> This was the caſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> he had ſhed the blood of the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> for this, vengeance came in a famine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and particularly upon his family. This was the caſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> alſo; he had ſhed the blood of <hi>Naboth,</hi> and of the Lords Prophets. This was the caſe of the Jews; <hi>That</hi> (ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>upon you may come all the righteous blood ſhed, from the blood of Abel, to the blood of Zechariah;</hi> and the blood of Chriſt by them ſhed, lieth upon that whole people unto this day.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, <hi>How far may this Vengeance extend?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I anſwer, <hi>Not to the inward man. The ſpiritual, or eternal puniſhment</hi> of any man conſiſteth of two Eſſential parts, <hi>the ſoul and the body;</hi> both theſe are capable of puniſhment, both in this life, and that which is to come: hence ariſeth the diſtinction of puniſhment, into that which is <hi>Corporal,</hi> and that which is <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;</hi> that which is <hi>Temporal,</hi> and that which is <hi>Eternal.</hi> Now I do not think, that God puniſheth the ſouls of ſucceeding gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, not going on in the ſame, or equal ſins, for the ſins of a preceeding generation; or the ſouls of correlates, for the ſins of their Relations. In this ſenſe I take that Text, Ezech. 18.4. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall dye: the ſon ſhall not bear the iniquity of the father: nor the father the iniquity of the child.</hi> As alſo that Jer. 31.29. <hi>They ſhall not uſe this Proverb, The Fathers have eaten ſour grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge: but every one ſhall dye for his own ſin:</hi> but whether that be the ſtrict ſenſe of thoſe Texts or no, I will not diſpute: this ſeemeth to me a ſufficient reaſon for this determination. <hi>Becauſe the ſoul of the child is no part of the parent.</hi> All ſouls are Gods, and derive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from him. One thing which is ſaid by Divines, in maintenance of the juſtice of God, in this diſpenſation, is this, <hi>That children are the goods of their parents, and parts of them, fleſh of their fleſh;</hi> but it cannot be ſaid ſo of their <hi>ſouls.</hi> Hence it followeth, that none, for the ſins of their Parents, or Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, is given up to <hi>hardneſs of heart, reprobacy of mind, or vile-affections;</hi> nor to any other ſpiritual wickedneſs, nor ſhall any periſh eternally for the ſins of others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For puniſhments of this life, they may extend to the third and fourth generation, even upon thoſe, who do not tread in the ſteps of their fore fathers, nor approve their ſayings.</hi> You know the words of the ſecond Commandment — <hi>viſiting the iniquity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation, of
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:192227:226"/>thoſe that hate me.</hi> There are that think, that thoſe later words are a limitation upon the former; and that God only threatens vengeance to the <hi>third and fourth generations,</hi> in caſe thoſe two generations go on to hate God; and thus the <hi>Caldee Paraphraſt</hi> gloſſeth, but this will not agree with the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> I deſire you to obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Thoſe that hate him</hi> (in that Commandment) are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>to them that love him</hi> in the ſame Commandment; ſo that if the threatning be to be limited, only to thoſe children who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the hatred of God, the promiſe alſo muſt be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only of thoſe thouſands that <hi>love God:</hi> and it would rather have been, that he would ſhew mercy to the third and fourth <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, of thoſe that love God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>What had there been extraordinary in the commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> God will moſt certainly puniſh them that hate him, for their perſonal hatred of him; certainly God brings it as a further argument to deter men from ſin, that he would not only revenge their ſins upon them, but upon their poſterity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This vengeance is not ſo neceſſary or certain, but that by the repentance, and humiliation of a preſent generation, though it will at laſt moſt certainly come, it may be deferred.</hi> The threatning againſt <hi>Ahab</hi> and his poſterity was, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.22, 23. <hi>Ahab</hi> was a little ſmitten upon it; God promiſeth to defer it, but tells him it ſhould come in his ſons days. <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>Ahaziah</hi> ſucceedeth him, and dyed by a fall; <hi>Jehoram,</hi> or <hi>Joram</hi> ſucceedeth him: then it began to work, <hi>Jehu</hi> ſlayeth him, and alſo all the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Ahab.</hi> God threatned <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> but becauſe there was good found in his young ſon <hi>Abijam,</hi> it fell not on him: 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.7, 8, 9, 16. but in his Grand-childs time it came. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was thus threatned for ſhewing the hid treaſures to the <hi>King of Babylons</hi> ſervants. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.17. <hi>Joſiah</hi> was his Grand-child, the third generation from <hi>Hezekiah; he humbled himſelf,</hi> and God yet deferred it. Thus we find vengeance of this nature coming on <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> in the ſecond generation; upon <hi>Ahab,</hi> in the third; upon <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in the fifth or ſixth generation. We find this vengeance taken off from <hi>Abijam, by ſome good thing found in him,</hi> put off in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time by his (though hypocritical) humiliation, by <hi>Joſiahs real humiliation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, <hi>When a generation goes on, and continues in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſins, we find vengeance following them to many generations.</hi>
                     <pb n="416" facs="tcp:192227:227"/>In that caſe (ſaith God) <hi>I will not keep ſilence, but will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence your iniquities, and the iniquities of your Fathers together, who have burnt incenſe upon the mountains, and blaſphemed me upon the hills; therefore will I meaſure their former work into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, Iſaiah</hi> 65.6, 7. This was the caſe of the Jews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.35. They continued <hi>ſhedding the blood of Prophets,</hi> and <hi>righteous men,</hi> and added to it the blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and they continued ſtill in their blaſphemies againſt Chriſt. They are not in a ſtate indeed, to execute their malice againſt Chriſt, and his Goſpel; but their hatred and blaſphemy continueth; and the vengeance of God to this day continueth upon them, and God is this day viſiting upon them <hi>their iniquities, and the iniquities of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers together.</hi> And thus much may ſerve to have ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the extent of this vengeance. I have but one thing more to do, before I come to the practical application of this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, to reconcile this motion of Divine Providence, to the juſtice and goodneſs of God, and the revelation of his will in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.4. and other Texts. This diſpenſation, at firſt view, ſeemeth not to comport with the juſtice of God, which muſt give every man his due, and recompence to every one, according to his work. Now the work of the Father, is not the <hi>work of the Child;</hi> how then cometh it to be recompenſed to the Child? much leſs doth it ſeem to comport with the <hi>goodneſs of God,</hi> to viſit the iniquity of the Father upon the child; and then it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to croſs what God hath ſaid, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall dye;</hi> and again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.29, 30. <hi>Every one ſhall dye for his own iniquity; every man that eateth the ſowre grape, his teeth ſhall be ſet on edge.</hi> But I beſeech you obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>How ready we are to quarrel with God, for what is done eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day with men, and no man accuſeth it of injuſtice;</hi> to take away the eſtates of Children, for the treaſons of Parents, for the debts of Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How ordinarily in war do innocent Children ſuffer for their Parents? yet as to man the law of God is plain, Deut. 24.16. <hi>The fathers ſhall not be put to death for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, neither ſhall the children be put to death for the parents; every man ſhall be put to death for his own ſin:</hi> and reaſon holds much ſtronger for Gods puniſhing, even with death, the ſin of the parent upon the child. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God can compenſate the loſs of a temporal life to the child, with an eternal life:</hi> this man cannot do. This was <hi>Auguſtines</hi> reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="417" facs="tcp:192227:227"/>2. <hi>God ſeeth guilt enough in children, to juſtifie his vengeance.</hi> To man they are innocent: yet according to that barbarous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in war, nothing is more ordinary, than to take away the lives of children, for the fathers faults; yet the world doth not much clamour at this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The juſtice of God is ſufficiently cleared in this, <hi>That God never puniſheth any for the ſin of their correlate, in whom there is not perſonal guilt enough, to juſtifie God in that proceeding.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in his puniſhment, beareth his own burden, though poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly his ſin, and the ſin of his father be puniſhed together.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Correlates are the goods of their Relations.</hi> Children are the great portion of Parents, ſo are people the riches and goods of Princes: thus <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſolveth this difficulty, <hi>Filii ſunt res paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Thus the learned <hi>Rivet</hi> ſaith, children have in them <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid parentis;</hi> indeed that is ſomething more, children are not only the portion, and goods of their parents, but they are pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their parents, and their parents are puniſhed in them. As <hi>David</hi> was puniſhed in the death of his firſt child by <hi>Bathſheba.</hi> Some may ſay, this is ſomething, if children were only puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during the life of their parents; but how are their parents pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in them when they are dead, before vengeance cometh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the child? Anſw. <hi>The fear of it all their life-time is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 2. <hi>Is it no puniſhment to them</hi> (though dead) <hi>to have their names blotted out?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The goodneſs of God is ſeen in this; <hi>That it is a rational means to do good to the parents, and parents are often advantaged by the puniſhment of the children. David</hi> was ſo, you know. If God will ſay to the child, I will puniſh you, and uſe your pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to do good to your parents; what have we to ſay to it? <hi>If we ought to lay down our lives for our brethren</hi> (as St. <hi>John</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines), certainly if God calls children to it, they ought to be willing to lay down their lives for their parents, if God impoſe it upon them. <hi>Debent parentibus hoc officium</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine). Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> diſputing the juſtice of the gods (he was a Heathen, and that his dialect) in this particular, ſaith, that <hi>Phyſitians uſe to bleed the arm for a pain in the head,</hi> and by a parity of reaſon, ſo excuſeth the Divine Juſtice. The Parents have been inſtruments of giving life to the Children; and God giveth Children many advantages for the Parents ſake.</p>

                     <pb n="418" facs="tcp:192227:228"/>5. In the mean time, <hi>if the children be good and holy, their afflictions are but fatherly chaſtiſements:</hi> Their deaths do but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them to a better life, ſo that they have no wrong, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in their ſouls, nor by eternal puniſhments for the ſins of their parents.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine) God</hi> by this means <hi>doth maintain diſcipline, and keep up his authority and government in ſtates, in the world, in his Church, in particular families.</hi> Now who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny God the liberty of exerciſing an act of meer Power and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty (if it were no more), when by it a diſcipline and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is kept up in the Univerſe, and by it many greater diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and wickedneſſes are prevented? Sinners are terrified, and the thoughts of the miſeries their children may feel for their ſins, may affright thoſe who would adventure their own skins, and necks, and ſouls too. I have now done with the Doctrinal part of this Obſervation, I come to the Practical Application of this diſcourſe.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. In the firſt place this may ſerve <hi>to ſatisfie us as to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God in the diſtribution of ſome rewards of this life to the worſt of men;</hi> by the rewards of this life, I underſtand riches, honours, outward proſperity and bleſſing. It is a ſaying uſually imputed to <hi>Hierom, Omnis Dives eſt vel injuſtus, vel injuſti haeres,</hi> every rich man is either an unrighteous man, or the <hi>ſon of an unrighteous man.</hi> I do not know but we may ſay the contrary, That every proſperous man is either <hi>juſtus aut haeres juſti,</hi> either himſelf a good and righteous man, or the <hi>child</hi> of ſuch a one; I mean, not the immediate child, but deſcended from ſuch a one. I will not aſſert it too univerſally, but ſhall refer it to your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. If you ſee a leud and wicked man growing great, rich, proſpering much in the world; obſerve whether he be not one, who like <hi>Jehu,</hi> hath not perſonally done ſome eminent ſervice for God: ſo <hi>Jehu</hi> did, ſo <hi>Aſſyria</hi> did, ſo <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did, he made his Army to do a great ſervice againſt <hi>Tyre.</hi> 2. If you cannot find that, enquire if he were not a deſcendent from ſome that had done ſome ſuch ſervice. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Joaſh Jehu's</hi> Grandchild, was a naughty man, yet the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had no ſuch time of proſperity, as in his Reign: God did not reward any perſonal vertue in him, but he rewarded the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which his Grandfather <hi>Jehu</hi> had done againſt the houſe of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:192227:228"/>
                     <hi>Ahab.</hi> The proſperity therefore of wicked men ſhould not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us, nor be a temptation to us: we ſhould only conclude thus: How much more will the Lord reward his faithful ſervants, who worſhip and ſerve him in truth, and with a perfect heart!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. In the ſecond place, This may ſerve to rectifie the miſtakes of thoſe who may be under a temptation to ſay with <hi>David, That they have waſhed their hands in vain, and cleanſed their hearts for nothing,</hi> or (to allude to the Apoſtles phraſe), <hi>We have been fiſhing all day, and caught nothing.</hi> The error lyeth in your <hi>miſapprehenſions,</hi> thinking you have no reward, unleſs it be made to you perſonally, yea and ſenſibly too.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Is it nothing, <hi>that he who feareth God and worketh righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is accepted of him?</hi> And that you have as to this the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual feaſt</hi> of a good conſcience; no recoilings of your own breaſt, no ſowre reflections from thence? ſurely this is ſomething, you have <hi>Chriſts peace,</hi> when-as <hi>to the wicked there is no peace.</hi> This is a reward unſpeakable, paſſing all underſtanding.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If your ſufferings be any <hi>teſtimony for Chriſt, are they not rewards in themſelves?</hi> doth not the Lord honour that perſon whom he calleth out to be a witneſs for his name? few are called to ſuffer for Chriſt. <hi>Luther</hi> was troubled that God did not think him worthy of ſuch a Crown. The Apoſtles rejoyced, that the Lord thought them worthy to ſuffer for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But ſatisfie thy ſelf; <hi>It may be God hath laid up the reward for thy poſterity,</hi> and thy children, and childrens children, ſhall poſſibly reap what thou haſt ſown: be aſſured, good actions ſhall not be without their reward, but rewards are not all of a kind; no man ſhall ever ſay, he hath waited upon the Lord in vain, or ſought his face for nothing.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 3. This calleth upon us all to take heed of <hi>ſinning againſt the living God, eſpecially ſuch ſins as I have before inſtanced in;</hi> there are many arguments to be uſed to defame ſin, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade from it. To them all let this be added, <hi>the curſe which ſin entails upon our poſterity:</hi> our ſins are ſometimes <hi>hid with God, and ſealed up in a bag,</hi> and the vengeance of God for them falls not upon our ſelves, but upon thoſe that come after us. Now the force of this argument lyes in that natural affection which
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:192227:229"/>every man hath for his poſterity: he muſt be a very debauched perſon that hath no regard to his poſterity, every one almoſt is careful to lay up ſomething for his children, take heed of laying up a treaſure of <hi>Divine wrath for them.</hi> If you will not regard your own bodies, the peace of your own breaſts, nor your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare: yet fear ſinning againſt God, becauſe of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which may for your ſin come upon your poſterity. It is a terrible Meditation, to conſider how many the threatnings of God againſt children are for the parents ſins, <hi>Job</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen the fooliſh taking root, but ſuddenly I curſed his habitation: His children are far from ſafety, and they are cruſhed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</hi> And again, <hi>Job</hi> 17.5. <hi>He that ſpeaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children ſhall fail; the triumphing of the wicked is but ſhort, and the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment,</hi> Job 5.20. verſ. 10. <hi>His children ſhall ſeek to pleaſe the poor, and his hands ſhall reſtore their goods.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> 21.19. ſpeaking of the wicked, he ſaith, <hi>God layeth up iniquity for his children.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> 27.13, 14. <hi>This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppreſſors which they ſhall receive from the Almighty. If his children be multiplied, it is for the ſword, and his off-ſpring ſhall not be ſatisfied with bread. David,</hi> who was a Prophet, and by the ſpirit of Prophecy, did but ſee and foretel what ſhould come to paſs, having to do with wicked and deceitful men, <hi>who,</hi> Pſal. 109.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>opened their mouths againſt him, and ſpake againſt him with a lying tongue, compaſſed him about with words of hatred, and fought againſt him without a cauſe; for his love were his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, rewarding him evil for good, and hatred for his love;</hi> prayeth: <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Let his children be fatherleſs, and his wife a widow, let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them ſeek their bread alſo out of deſolate places.</hi> Iſa. 14.21. In the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt <hi>Babel</hi> you find theſe words, <hi>Prepare ſlaughter for his children, for the iniquities of their fathers, that they do not riſe, nor poſſeſs the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities:</hi> and Pſal. 137.8, 9. <hi>O daughter of Babylon, who art to be deſtroyed, happy ſhall he be that rewardeth thee, as thou haſt ſerved us: Happy ſhall he be that taketh and daſheth thy little ones againſt the ſtones.</hi> The Scripture is full of ſuch prophecies and threatnings, eſpecially in the caſe of ſome eminent oppreſſions or cruelties uſed by any parents, or ſome eminent corruptions in worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:192227:229"/>ſhould not this lay a law upon parents, who are ſo ſollicitous for the good and proſperity of their children when they ſhall not be? God layeth up the iniquities of parents many times for their children. In ſhort, as there is no man that can provide better for his children, than he that worketh righteouſneſs, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſerveth God in his generation. <hi>I never ſaw the righteous forſaken,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, nor their ſeed begging their bread:</hi> ſo none can provide worſe for their children, than by laying up a ſtock of ſin to be revenged upon them. Children are bound by law to pay their Fathers debts to man (that often proves heavy); but this is more dreadful, they often (as to temporal puniſhments) pay their Fathers debts alſo to the Juſtice of God: and this by the way ſheweth us the high advantage of <hi>godly parents,</hi> as the <hi>diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of thoſe who have had wicked and profane parents;</hi> the former inherit bleſſing, the latter curſing and judgment, very ordinarily upon the account of their parents.</p>

This obſervation calleth aloud to <hi>thoſe that are children deſcended from wicked and ungodly parents,</hi> (it may be the caſe of ſome that are before me) <hi>to be humbled for the ſins of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and predeceſſors.</hi> And, 2. <hi>To take heed of continuing in the ſins of their predeceſſors. Joſia</hi> was thus humbled, and the Lord turned away his wrath that it came not upon him, though it came upon his poſterity, when he was gone to his grave in peace. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> in his humiliation, <hi>chap</hi> 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. forgets not this, <hi>Becauſe for our ſins, and the iniquity of our fathers, Hieruſalem hath been made a reproach.</hi> The Church complaineth, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Our fathers have ſinned, and are not, and we have born their iniquity.</hi> Is there any here whoſe heart it may be is otherwiſe, but they have had a Father or Predeceſſor, who hath been a cruel bloody man, a perſecutor of the People of God, an hater and enemy of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Godlineſs? I would have ſuch a one think, that although his heart be otherwiſe, yet it is poſſible, his <hi>fathers iniquity may be laid up for him.</hi> The only way to prevent it, and to turn it off, is to get a <hi>tender broken heart for thy forefathers ſins;</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them, and to be humbled before the Lord for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But let all men take heed, that <hi>they continue not in them.</hi> You ſhall obſerve it often repeated in Scripture; Such a one <hi>did evil,</hi> and <hi>walked in the ſteps</hi> of his Father, in all the ſins of his Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you ſhall conſtantly obſerve that it is ſet as a mark of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:192227:230"/>upon thoſe that did ſo, and they periſhed in their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. God (according to what he threatned the <hi>Jews,</hi> Iſa. 65.7.) puniſhed upon them <hi>their iniquities, and the iniquities of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers together.</hi> We are very prone to walk in the ſteps of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (eſpecially if they have trodden awry, and turned aſide from the Commandments of God): and uſually in matters of Religion, though we have nothing to ſay for the ſuperſtition and vanity of former generations; yet we think it a ſufficient plea, <hi>that our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did thus or thus:</hi> and indeed this was the old plea of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Joh. 4. <hi>Our fathers worſhipped in this mountain.</hi> Thus the Heretick ſaid in one of the Councils, but was well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered—<hi>Immo errantes ab errantibus;</hi> yes, <hi>erring children, from erring parents.</hi> The wickedneſs of a preceding generation (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the matters of Divine Worſhip) is ſo far from being a plea for us, or excuſing us, that it doth but increaſe and aggravate guilt upon us. The moſt righteous perſons may without due and ſeaſonable humiliation ſmart for the ſins of their Fathers; but if they go on in the ſame ſins, they have nothing to expect, but that God ſhould puniſh their ſins, and the ſins of their Fathers together.</p>

                  <p>I Proceed yet to offer you ſome further Obſervations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motions of <hi>Actual Providence.</hi> I have already made many. Laſt of all, ſome with reference to its diſtributions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments. Let me now go on to a</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 20. <hi>When God calleth any to any new work or relation, he ordinarily giveth them a ſpirit ſuited to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every work and relation requires ſome particular diſpoſitions fitting the perſons for it. Now I ſay, you ſhall obſerve in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Actual Providence, that it fitteth thoſe perſons for work whom God calleth to it: you ſhall ſee it in ſeveral inſtances. God called <hi>Moſes</hi> to go in to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to require him to let the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, and ſo to conduct the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt. Moſes</hi> ſaith to God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Who am I that I ſhould go unto Pharaoh, and that I ſhould bring the children of Iſrael out of Egypt.</hi> God ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>I will be with thee.</hi> Again, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Moſes</hi> excuſeth himſelf, that <hi>he was not eloquent, but ſlow of ſpeech, and of a ſlow tongue:</hi> ſee what God ſaith to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Who hath made mans mouth, or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or ſeeing, or blind? Now therefore,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou ſhalt ſay.</hi> When God called <hi>Saul</hi> to be King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the text, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.9. ſaith, <hi>That God gave him another heart.</hi> When God called <hi>David</hi> to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, what a ſpirit of government did God give him? What <hi>courage and valour,</hi> that coming from keeping of <hi>ſheep,</hi> he durſt adventure to <hi>encounter Goliah?</hi> Concerning <hi>Solomon</hi> the caſe is plain, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.8, 9. he begged of God a wiſe and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart to judg his people. The text telleth you, that God
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:192227:231"/>gave it him; <hi>Lo</hi> (ſaith God, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.) <hi>I have given thee a wiſe and underſtanding heart.</hi> As to the Miniſtry, the caſe is plain, as to <hi>Jeremiah, God ordained him to be a prophet to the nations.</hi> Jer. 1.5. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> excuſed himſelf, <hi>he was a child, and could not ſpeak,</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>But the Lord ſaid to him, Say not I am a child, for thou ſhalt go to all that I ſhall ſend thee; and whatſoever I command thee, thou ſhalt ſpeak: Be not afraid of their faces, for I am with thee, to deliver thee (ſaith the Lord); then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth, and the Lord ſaid to me, Behold I have put my words into thy mouth,</hi> verſ. 7, 8. The like you have concerning <hi>Ezekiel, Ezek.</hi> 2. The like you find upon Chriſts ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ſeventy and the twelve. It is true, God doth this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, and by ſeveral rites and ceremonies; but God never yet call'd any to any new relation, or new work, but he gave them a ſpirit fit for it. But let us a little underſtand what the meaning of that is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein lyeth the ſutableneſs of a perſons <hi>ſpirit to his work or relation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It lyes in two things: 1. An <hi>inclination,</hi> or <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it.</hi> 2. <hi>A fittedneſs</hi> or <hi>preparedneſs for it.</hi> 1. <hi>An incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or willingneſs to it.</hi> Indeed Gods firſt call of a perſon to a work, doth not always meet with a <hi>willing mind,</hi> it did not in <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> in <hi>Saul;</hi> but God always makes thoſe willing whom he calls to any ſervice; <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend? here am I, ſend me,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> God made <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before he ſent them. The gravity and burthen of the work to which God calleth, may diſcourage fleſh and blood at firſt, but God makes them willing before they take their Commiſſion. Hence that in <hi>Timothy, He that deſireth the office of a Biſhop,</hi> &amp;c. 2. But this is not all; God never ſendeth any to any work, but he fitteth and prepareth them for it, <hi>giving them a frame of ſpirit, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of mind, capacitating them for the parts of their work, or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that relation:</hi> ſeveral callings require ſeveral gifts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments. For the <hi>magiſtracy, courage,</hi> and <hi>wiſdom</hi> is neceſſary: for the <hi>miniſtry</hi> is neceſſary, not only <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> but <hi>knowledg, utterance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a ſound underſtanding</hi> in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which he is to open to the people, and apply to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; and ſo in inferiour relations, even <hi>Bezaliel</hi> the ſon of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ri, whom the Lord called by name,</hi> to the building of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.31. <hi>Was filled with the ſpirit of God in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:192227:231"/>and in underſtanding, and in knowledg, and in all manner of workmanſhip, and to deviſe curious works, to work in gold, and in ſilver, and in braſs, and in the cutting of ſtones to ſet them, and in cutting of wood to make any manner of cunning-work,</hi> and God put into his heart to teach others. Hence it is we ſee ſuch a ſtrange improvement (as we call it) in gifts and parts, in perſons called of God to offices of the magiſtracy or miniſtry: That once fixed in thoſe relations, there is (as is ſaid of <hi>Saul) another ſpirit given them,</hi> they are quite other men, than they appeared to the world before. The Actual Providence of God attending perſons in new works, and new relations, with new ſpirits, new gifts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this working of Providence ſeemeth ſo reaſonable, that the contrary cannot be ſuppoſed without <hi>a blaſphemous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of the wiſdom of God.</hi> Which of us unleſs ſurprized by our own ignorance, or over-born with ſome fooliſh luſt or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our own, would ſet any perſon about our work, that is in nothing fit for it? Indeed our reaſonable nature will not allow us wilfully to commit ſuch a miſtake; to ſuppoſe <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>any bias of paſſion in God,</hi> were but to blaſpheme. Who can without blaſphemy ſay, God hath called a <hi>fool</hi> to be a <hi>magiſtrate,</hi> or a <hi>coward</hi> to be a <hi>ſoldier,</hi> or an <hi>ignorant perſon,</hi> that cannot ſpeak, or not ſpeak ſenſe to be a <hi>Miniſter?</hi> It is true, Gods gifts are inequally diſtributed according to the good pleaſure of his own will; ſome have greater abilities for <hi>magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>miniſtry</hi> than others have, and ſo are more eminently qualified for their work: but there are none called of God to any employment, but are in ſuch a competent meaſure qualified for it, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal acts of it, that they are able to do that work; and I ſay, but to ſuppoſe the contrary concerning God, were either to ſuppoſe, that God was <hi>ſurprized with ſome ignorance,</hi> or <hi>biaſſed with ſome paſſion,</hi> or did that which no reaſonable creature would do.</p>
                  <p>But here ariſeth a queſtion. Queſt. <hi>How then comes it to paſs that we ſee in the experience of all ages, perſons employed in works and relations, by no means, nor in any degree qualified for the work of their relations; cometh this without God?</hi> Is there any thing which eſcapeth his Providence?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, We are now ſpeaking, not of the <hi>permiſſions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> but the <hi>efficiencies of it.</hi> Perſons at works, and in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they are in no meaſure fit or qualified for, <hi>are great
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:192227:232"/>evils to the world,</hi> and theſe <hi>evils</hi> are not in <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> without Gods permiſſion and ſufferance. The ſhort of it is this, That ſometimes it is in the heart of God <hi>to bleſs and proſper a people,</hi> and to vouchſafe his preſence amongſt them; when he doth ſo, he doth accordingly adequate and proportion means in order to that end. For Magiſtrates, if he doth not give them men according to <hi>Gods own heart,</hi> ſuch as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi> yet he gives them ſuch men whom he hath fitted with a <hi>ſutable ſpirit</hi> to their work, that whatever they be as men, are good governours, men of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi> and <hi>courage,</hi> men of <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> that know how to manage affairs of ſtate. When God hath a contrary deſign to chaſtiſe and afflict a people, and to puniſh men for their ſins, he ſuffers ſuch to come in either by <hi>election</hi> or <hi>ſucceſſion,</hi> as are no ways fitted for the duties of thoſe great relations. So for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, when God deſigneth to grant, and to continue to a people, his preſence and bleſſing, he gives them faithful Miniſters, and ſuch as are able to teach others, to reveal the whole Counſel of God to them, to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the ſouls that are weary, to bind up the broken in heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when he hath deſigns to chaſten and ſcourge any people, he ſuffereth ſuch to get into the Miniſtry, as are deſcribed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.10. <hi>Blind and ignorant watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, dumb dogs, that cannot bark, ſleeping, lying down to ſlumber, greedy dogs which can never have enough, ſhepheards that cannot underſtand,</hi> &amp;c. you have this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.25, 26. <hi>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy droſs, and take away thy tin;</hi> that is, I will return in mercy to thee: and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth? <hi>And I will reſtore thy Judges as at the firſt, and thy Counſellors as at the beginning, afterward thou ſhalt be called the City of righteouſneſs:</hi> and ſo for the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> Jer. 3.14, 15. God <hi>ver.</hi> 14. ſaith, <hi>Turn, O back-ſliding children</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>for I am married unto you, and I will take you one of a City, and two of a tribe, and will bring you to Zion: and I will give you paſtors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my heart, which ſhall feed you with wiſdom, and with underſtanding.</hi> So again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.3, 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>And I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the remnant of my flock out of all countreys, whither I have driven them; and will bring them again to their folds, and they ſhall be fruitful, and increaſe: and I will ſet up ſhepheards over them which ſhall feed them, and they ſhall fear no more, nor be diſmayed, neither ſhall they be lacking</hi> (ſaith the Lord). On the contrary when God is in a courſe of vengeance and judgment againſt a
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:192227:232"/>people; when God hath forſaken a people, he ſuffereth a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry that <hi>prophecy lyes,</hi> but <hi>ſends them not, Jer.</hi> 27.14, 15. <hi>For they prophecy a lye unto you, for I have not ſent them</hi> (ſaith the Lord), <hi>yet they prophecy a lye in my name:</hi> ſee the ſame, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.14, 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21, 22. <hi>verſ.</hi> 38. The ſum of this diſcourſe is this:</p>
                  <p>That when the Providence of God is moving in a way of mercy, towards <hi>any Nation, Church</hi> or <hi>Family;</hi> he ſets perſons in <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them,</hi> and calleth them to work in them, whom he hath fitted, and doth fit, for the ſeveral parts of their work, with ſuch gifts and graces of his ſpirit, as qualifie and capacitate them for the work and relation to which God calleth them: and this he doth by way of <hi>efficiency,</hi> pouring out his ſpirit upon ſuch perſons; but when he is proceeding in a way of wrath and judgment againſt a people, either finally to deſtroy them, or ſeverely to chaſten them for their iniquities, then he ſuffereth ſuch <hi>Rulers,</hi> and <hi>ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> to be over them, or ſuch <hi>governours in any ſocieties</hi> as are no way fit for their work; Rulers that have <hi>no wiſdom, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> proportioned to their relation, no courage nor va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, no principles of juſtice and righteouſneſs, but ſuch as will (as the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> expreſſeth it) <hi>ſell the needy for a pair of ſhooes,</hi> and the <hi>poor for a piece of ſilver,</hi> and ſuffereth Miniſters to riſe up and be allowed, that are <hi>blind, dumb, ignorant, greedy,</hi> indeed not fitted at all for their work, or the ſeveral parts of it; but only fitted for Gods deſign, to be a ſcourge and a plague to the people, amongſt whom they go to ſeduce them, to tear, to rend, and to devour them: and this you ſhall obſerve to be the conſtant motion of the Actual Providence of God. And thus I have opened the Obſervation to you, I come now to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. In the firſt place, This obſervation affordeth us another <hi>ſign of the times.</hi> I obſerved to you before, that we have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a curioſity to know what ſhall come to paſs in future times, how it ſhall go, to know both <hi>what God is doing with his Church in the age wherein we live, and what he will do with it in the ages following.</hi> He that maketh this obſervation, will in this point be <hi>ſpiritually wiſe,</hi> and will alſo <hi>underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord;</hi> yea and by this we may underſtand what the Counſels of God are (in a great meaſure) as to families and perſons. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:192227:233"/>but <hi>what</hi> thoſe are whom God ſets over them, or ſuffers to ſtand in relation to them, and you will underſtand much of this. If God intendeth mercy and goodneſs to any Nation or any Church, he giveth them <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Counſellors</hi> as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Eccl. 10.16, 17. <hi>Wo to thee, O Land, when thy King is a Child, and Princes eat in the morning. Bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the ſon of Nobles, and thy Princes eat in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for ſtrength, and not for drunkenneſs.</hi> Obſerve but in the ſtate who are in the places of Magiſtrates, whether they be men of <hi>wiſdom, and knowledge,</hi> of <hi>juſtice,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> or men of little wiſdom, raſh and inconſiderate men, men of little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, men that will take bribes, and oppreſs the poor, and needy in judgment, not ſuffering the cauſes of the poor to ſtand in judgment; and you may eaſily judge what God is about with that Nation. Look into the Church of God, and obſerve what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they are, that are in the Miniſtry: Whether they be men that are able and faithful to teach, skilled in the words of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, able to open and apply the holy Scriptures to the hearts and Conſciences of people, to pray and to pour out their ſouls unto God in ſupplications: Or men that were <hi>Aptiores ad ſtivam,</hi> (as <hi>Beza</hi> ſometimes ſaid). I may add, <hi>ad cauponam vel tabernam,</hi> fitter for a Plow-tail, for an Ale-houſe, a Tavern, or a Victualling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and it needeth no interpreter to you, what God is about to do with ſuch a Church. In like manner, look into families, look upon particular perſons; obſerve what manner of perſons are in the relations of Husbands, Wives, Parents, Children; and you may eaſily know Gods preſent deſign, or what he is after like to do in ſuch families, or as to ſuch perſons. Where God intendeth mercy, he fitteth perſons for their reſpective relations in all humane ſocieties.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Hence (again) in the ſecond place, each one may make <hi>a judgement of himſelf, whether God hath called him to this or that work,</hi> this or that <hi>Relation.</hi> A man can have little comfort in any relation, to which he cannot ſee himſelf <hi>called of God;</hi> be it <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> or <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> or any other Relation, when we ſee God calling us to it, we may <hi>look for Gods bleſſing upon us in it,</hi> ay and we may, in that caſe alſo expect <hi>Gods protection;</hi> his ſtanding by us, and ſtanding up for us againſt <hi>Oppoſition:</hi> now neither of theſe can in other cauſes be expected. I ſay, 1. A perſon called of God to
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:192227:233"/>any work, any relation, may reaſonably <hi>expect the bleſſing of God upon him in it:</hi> If he be a Magiſtrate, that God ſhould make his government peaceable, and proſperous, ſubduing the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; and ſubjecting their ſpirits to his Government: If he be a Miniſter, that God ſhould direct his meditations, aſſiſt his heart in enditing new matter, and his tongue that it ſhould be the tongue of a ready writer, bleſſing his labours, and giving in to his miniſtry the ſouls of the people committed to his charge. He may expect Gods protection and defence of him againſt the oppoſition that he meets with. It is a promiſe you ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily meet with annexed to precepts, by which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned men to be Miniſters. <hi>I will be with you,</hi> it is what God ſaid to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> to <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> What <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be with you to the end of the world;</hi> now that promiſe reacheth to both theſe, both <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> and <hi>protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and therefore it is of mighty concern to ſuch as ingage in great work, or are put into any great relation, to ſee <hi>Gods call of them to that work or relation;</hi> without a view of that I again tell you, they can expect the preſence of God no way, neither bleſſing, nor protecting them. Now from this obſervation upon the motions of <hi>Actual Providence</hi> you may make up a judgement of that. <hi>Actual Providence</hi> fits them for that work and Relation, whom God calleth to it; it doth not fit every one for it, whom it ſuffereth to creep into it, but it fits all for their work whom God directs into it, and who are like to be a bleſſing to their Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates: and thoſe who cannot find themſelves fitted of God for the work and acts of that Relation wherein they are, may conclude, that though they be not in that ſtation <hi>without God;</hi> yet God hath nothing further to do with them in their ſtation, but to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them</hi> to get into it for a plague and <hi>ſcourge</hi> to the people, to whom they are in relation, and for their own <hi>damnation,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion at the laſt.</hi> Is any one a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> (to inſtance only in that Relation) he ſtands moſt highly concerned of all men living to ſee his call; (the charge of ſouls, men will at laſt find a great and burthenſom charge). If he be <hi>faithful,</hi> he is like to meet with the greateſt oppoſition imaginable in that work, he ſtands in need of the greateſt <hi>aſſiſtance of God,</hi> for the due performance of it: he can look for neither, unleſs he can find that God hath called him to his work. The great acts of the <hi>miniſterial office,</hi> are <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>preaching; praying for the people:</hi> Preaching, that is, <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:192227:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Scriptures,</hi> the will and counſel of God unto people, and applying it to their Conſciences. Wouldſt thou know now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>thou beeſt called of God as</hi> Aaron <hi>was.</hi> Examine then <hi>whether God hath fitted thee for the work of the miniſtry.</hi> Hath God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee <hi>the Spirit of prayer, and ſupplication?</hi> hath God given thee a knowledge and underſtanding in the Scriptures, that thou art (as it was ſaid of <hi>Apollos) mighty in the Scriptures;</hi> ſuch a one a Miniſter ſhould be. If Gods providence hath given thee a willingneſs, and a deſire to it, and an opportunity for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it, and hath alſo thus qualified thee for the ſeveral parts of it, then thou mayeſt conclude, that God hath called thee to it. It is not a <hi>Patrons preſentation</hi> that will make up the call of God, no nor yet the boldneſs and confidence of the perſon that will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the greateſt employment the world affords. I ſay none of theſe things will do it; a mans own needs, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to live, may make him willing and deſirous, but they are only the gifts and graces of Gods ſpirit, that can make a man fit for the Miniſtry; and God never ſends any to any work, but his Providence fitteth them for it; and the ſame may be ſaid of any other <hi>Relations,</hi> or of perſons employed in any great work. And as perſons imployed in any work or relation, may thus judge of themſelves: So alſo their <hi>Correlates,</hi> to whom they are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, may by this means know how to judge of thoſe who are in relation to them, whether they be <hi>called of God or no,</hi> and be ſuch or no, with whom they can expect the preſence of God, and from whom they may expect Gods bleſſing; and this if duly thought upon ſhould ſtrike a terror into men, in places and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments eſpecially <hi>relating to the worſhip of God,</hi> and in truſt with ſouls, who are no more qualified for their work, than an <hi>Aſs is for a Fiddle,</hi> as we ſay; what will theſe men ſay, when their Conſciences come to arreſt them with a <hi>what doeſt thou here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy wedding-garment?</hi> That is, without thoſe gifts and graces, without that heart and ſpirit, which ſhould have qualified thee for ſuch a work, and which God never faileth to furniſh him with, whom he calls to any employment for him. Or when they ſhall come to dye, and have no ſweeter reflections of Conſcience than this: I have theſe 20, 30, 40 years been Gods ſcourge and plague to this people, ſoothing up this people <hi>in their ſins, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their eyes, hardning their hearts,</hi> meerly eating up that bread which ſhould have fed other faithful Paſtors, who were able to
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:192227:234"/>have prayed for them, able to have inſtructed them, which I have not been. O the ſearedneſs of theſe mens Conſciences; <hi>O the dreadful vengeance of God, that hangs over their heads!</hi> O the ſtrange quantity of the blood of ſouls which God will require at theſe pitiful wretches hands! Let not my ſoul enter into theſe mens ſecrets, let not their portion be mine, O my God!</p>

                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. But in the third place, Let me caution you, that <hi>you do not think that the Providence of God doth alike qualifie every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the duties of his relation.</hi> As in the Heavens there are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Stars, and they differ one from another in glory: Every Star is a light, but ſome give a far greater, and more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light than others; ſo it is in the <hi>Church of God</hi> (Miniſters, you know, are compared to Stars) they muſt all be lights; they muſt all be able to ſhew light, both in their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and alſo in their <hi>Lives;</hi> but yet ſome are more glorious lights than others are, more burning, more ſhining.</p>
                  <p>God calleth no man to the Miniſtry, but they are <hi>able to pray, able to preach</hi> (he ſets no dumb dogs to keep his ſheep): he ſets none over his people to be their <hi>Biſhops</hi> but they are <hi>blameleſs, ſober,</hi> of <hi>good behaviour, given to hoſpitality, apt to teach, not given to wine, no ſtrikers,</hi> &amp;c. as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. ſober, juſt, holy, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as 1 <hi>Titus</hi> 7.8. It is little leſs than <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> to ſay God calls a man to <hi>pray or preach,</hi> that can do none of both; that God calleth <hi>Drunkards</hi> to teach men ſobriety, or <hi>unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to teach them chaſtity,</hi> or <hi>covetous wretches</hi> to teach men ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitality, or liberality. But yet ſome may be of more eminent gifts for prayer and preaching; ſome may be more <hi>eminent in grace,</hi> more exemplary in holineſs than others. God hath ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Miniſters; ſome he ſets upon Hills, ſome he placeth in obſcure Valleys. And indeed herein the <hi>Church,</hi> I mean the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Governours of a Church, ſeem to have a great judgment. They ſhall not judge a perſon fit for the Miniſtry, that is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently unfit, not being able to diſcharge any part of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial work: but they ſhall judge of the degrees of perſons, gifts and abilities, ſo as to place perſons in ſtations fit for them, and as will be beſt for the edification of the whole. But the caution which I offer you in this branch of Application, if you well conſider it, is of great uſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="432" facs="tcp:192227:235"/>1. <hi>To reſtrain the unwarrantable judgement, and cenſures of leſs knowing, and prudent Chriſtians;</hi> who are ready to cenſure good men of weaker parts, and abilities for the work of praying, and preaching, as no true Miniſters, not called of God to their work. Is the perſon a man of a holy life, and converſation? Is he a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon able to <hi>pray and preach ſubſtantially,</hi> though it may be not ſo <hi>fluently,</hi> not ſo <hi>floridly</hi> as ſome others, not with that <hi>life and affection,</hi> not with that learning and <hi>clearneſs of demonſtration?</hi> Take heed of judging in this caſe, God diſtributeth his gifts vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, though always to edification of the whole Church. In his Church there are ſome <hi>Babes,</hi> ſome <hi>grown Perſons;</hi> ſome that muſt be fed with milk, others that muſt have ſtrong meat. God qualifieth ſome to <hi>give milk</hi> to the Babes, others to <hi>give meat to ſtronger ones:</hi> indeed the wonderful wiſdom of God is to be ſeen in this diſproportioning of his gifts to his ſeveral Miniſters. We are poor vain creatures, and though <hi>bleſſed be God!</hi> ſome learned men of great reaſon, and learning are to be found, that can deny themſelves in their miniſterial work, and preach to the capacity and underſtanding of poor creatures; yet <hi>Quotuſquiſ<expan>

                  <p n="2">2. This <hi>Caution</hi> is uſeful alſo to <hi>relieve the Conſciences of good men, who</hi> are often-times <hi>troubled</hi> under the ſenſe of the <hi>diſparity and diſproportion of their own gifts and parts, to the gifts and parts of others. I have</hi> known it the caſe of ſome. Look as it hath been with ſome Chriſtians, for want of ſome gifts, which at beſt have been but common gifts, ſuch as that of <hi>Prayer,</hi> they
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:192227:235"/>have been ready to queſtion whether they have any truth of grace, yea or no. So I have known ſome precious godly Miniſters in their melancholick, dark-hours, queſtioning whether they have not all their life-time invaded the Miniſterial function; whether ever they were called of God to the work of the Miniſtry, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they have been conſcious to themſelves, that they have not had thoſe eminent gifts and parts which they have heard others ſhew. This trouble is as groundleſs as the other. God doth not give to all his Miniſters, the ſame proportion of parts and gifts. Indeed to every one whom he calleth to the Miniſtry he giveth ſuch a proportion of gifts as ſhall qualifie them, that they ſhall be able both to Pray and Preach, ſo as not be a juſt loathing to any honeſt hearts. I will never believe that God hath called any man to the Miniſtry, who cannot without his Book, upon any occaſion pray for the people committed to his truſt, or for any of them, according to any particular occaſion offered him; or that cannot Preach. But this is a moſt unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſcruple; God doth not give gifts alike unto all, no not unto all thoſe whom yet he calls unto his work.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 4. In the fourth place, <hi>This obſervation may be of great uſe to relieve the ſpirits of the people of God, under the temptations of their own fears;</hi> when God calleth them to Relations and works, to which they do not find ſuch a fitneſs, as (poſſibly) they deſire to find, and according to the exactneſs of the Divine rule ought to be found in perſons ſet in their circumſtances. It is a frequent caſe, and that, 1. With reference to <hi>new Relations.</hi> 2 <hi>To ſome new work, eſpecially where ſuffering attends it;</hi> we often find the ſpirits of good people diſturbed upon both accounts. Some with reference to their duty <hi>in their relations,</hi> they are afraid they ſhould not honour God in the Relations of <hi>Husbands, Wives, Parents,</hi> &amp;c. they do not find their ſpirits ſuted to it. Some with <hi>reference to ſuffering,</hi> they do not find <hi>it is given to them on the behalf of Chriſt to ſuffer.</hi> Now in this caſe truly, I think, two things are to be ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in ſuch caſes, <hi>Nothing but ſin on the other hand, can oblige ſuch perſons to enter any ſuch relations, or to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any work.</hi> The caſe may be ſo that a neceſſity may be laid on Chriſtians to enter ſuch, <hi>and ſuch relations.</hi> Thus it may be in the caſe of publick Relations, in the caſe of Magiſtrates and
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:192227:236"/>Miniſters; oftentimes <hi>vox populi</hi> is <hi>vox Dei,</hi> the ſuffrage of the people is the voice God: and ſo in caſe of more domeſtick Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there may be a neceſſity laid upon ſingle perſons to marry, to become Husbands, Wives, Parents, Governours of Families; a neceſſity from <hi>nature,</hi> or upon ſome <hi>moral accounts,</hi> which may be divers, obedience to Parents, the comfortable ſupport of our ſelves in the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo as to <hi>work,</hi> there may be a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the work muſt be done, there is none to do it, I am the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon pitched upon, either I muſt do it or none. So in caſe of <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> either I muſt ſuffer, or I muſt ſin againſt God. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, there can be no neceſſity of ſinning; in this caſe there is a neceſſity of ſuffering. Here the <hi>call of God</hi> is plain, <hi>neceſſity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon us is an unqueſtionable call.</hi> But, I ſay, ſuppoſing no ſuch neceſſity, but that it is <hi>res integra,</hi> as we ſay, we are not ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by any neceſſity of ſinning, I would have none put themſelves into any relation, nor upon any work, nor expoſe themſelves to any ſuffering, but ſuch as find in themſelves an inclination to it, and ſome meaſure of habitual preparation, and qualifications for it; and it is that, which if I remember right, the generality of Divines do determine in the caſe of <hi>perſecution,</hi> and <hi>the lawfulneſs of flight in the time of perſecution;</hi> adviſing all, that do not find a ſpirit within them ſuted to ſuffering, to fly from one City to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where they can do it under ſuch circumſtances, as they ſhall not be ſinners againſt God for the doing of it.</p>
                  <p>But, 2. Where the <hi>call of God</hi> to them is clear, that is, that they muſt <hi>enter that Relation,</hi> they muſt do that work, they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to that ſuffering, or they muſt do that which their Conſciences will condemn them for as ſinners: here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done, but for the ſouls that are concerned to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch Relations, to undertake ſuch work, to expoſe themſelves to ſuch ſufferings; committing themſelves unto God, believing that he who hath called them to it, will carry them through it; for the Providence of God doth very ordinarily with a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and new work, give a new ſpirit. And experience tells us, that none have gone through a new relation or work, better than thoſe who at firſt moſt dreaded it, and diſtruſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and trembled moſt at the apprehenſions of it. You have ſeen ſometimes a Dog, that being about to take the water, hath ſtood upon the brink, ſhaking and trembling, who when he hath been tumbled in, or of himſelf leaped in, hath ſwame through
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:192227:236"/>well enough. And abundance of inſtances might be given of ſuch, as when the Providence of God hath called them to ſuffering, have ſtood trembling, and been afraid to venture; who when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God hath thrown them upon the work, and neceſſitated them to it, or when (having got a victory over their own fears), they have adventured upon it, none have behaved themſelves, nor been more valiant in the ſpiritual fight, than they have been: God hath made good his promiſe to them. When they have been in the waters, God hath been with them; and when they have been in the fires, God hath been with them, and hath not ſuffered the waters to drown them, nor yet the flames to kindle upon them. It is but an ordinary motion of Providence to come in to the help and aſſiſtance of, and to fit thoſe for a new work and new relation, whom he hath call'd to it. Only be ſure that in caſe you find a reluctancy in your own ſpirits, and you cannot ſee your call from Gods fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you, and ſpiriting you for your relation, or for your work; that you ſee your call from a <hi>neceſſity,</hi> which the Providence of God hath impoſed on you, that you cannot avoid it without ſinning againſt God.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. In the laſt place, Doth God ordinarily ſute men whom he calleth to any new work, or new relation, with a ſpirit ſuted to their new capacity? This ſhould engage all men then to <hi>co-work with God,</hi> uſing ſuch means as have any <hi>natural, moral, or religious tendency, to fit them for the diſcharge of the truſt which God hath repoſed in them, or the work to which God hath called them.</hi> Our relations and works are very various and different, and accordingly there is a great difference of means to be uſed for the improvement of our ſelves into a capacity to do the duty of our places. It cannot be expected that I ſhould ſpeak to all, ſome I will ſhortly ſpeak unto. Shall God call you, or any of you to the place of a <hi>Magiſtrate?</hi> That now is a place and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the fitting of a perſon for which requireth <hi>Knowledg, Wiſdom, Courage.</hi> You have heard that when God calleth any perſon to a place, he uſually fitteth them with a ſpirit for it, as he gave unto <hi>Saul another ſpirit</hi> (the Scripture ſaith) a ſpirit quite different from what he had when he was a private perſon. But you are not now to expect this in a way of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> but in the uſe of means, reading books, gaining of knowledg, indeavouring to bridle ſuch paſſions as become no man, but are leaſt of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming

Courage indeed is a thing that is hardly got by art, though natural courage be governed and regulated by it; and often is given by God more immediately, when any whom he hath called to any new relation, hath more eſpecial need of it. But above all, remember the courſe that <hi>Solomon</hi> took, when God appeared unto him in <hi>Gibeon</hi> (upon his taking upon him the government of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah):</hi> He prayeth unto God, that he would give <hi>him a wiſe and an underſtanding heart,</hi> to judg his people. O forget not this, hath God called thee to be a Magiſtrate? and doeſt thou diſtruſt thy ſelf, leſt thou ſhouldſt fail in Wiſdom, or in Courage, as to the work of God which in that relation will lye upon thy ſoul? Remember what God ſaid in ſome anger to <hi>Moſes,</hi> excuſing himſelf from what God had call'd him to, to go into <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to ſpeak for the diſmiſſion of his people; and <hi>Moſes</hi> excuſed himſelf, ſaying, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.20. <hi>O Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor ſince thou haſt ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſervant: but I am ſlow of ſpeech, and of a ſlow tongue; and the Lord ſaid unto him,</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>Who hath made mans mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the ſeeing, or the blind? Have not I</hi> (ſaith the Lord)? <hi>Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou ſhalt ſay.</hi> Remember that and go, and beg of God to ſupply unto thee, what thou findeſt want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thy ſelf, beg <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of that God, who is only <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>courage</hi> of that God <hi>who giveth courage unto man.</hi> Hath God called thee to the work of the Miniſtry? and though thou dareſt not ſay, but God hath in ſome meaſure fitted thee for it; yet thou feeſt thou art far ſhort of others, far ſhort of what thou conceiveſt thou oughteſt to be. I have told thee that God uſeth with his call to a new work, to a new relation, to give a new ſpirit; but it is thy work and duty here to work together with God. Thus the Apoſtle exhorteth <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12, 13, 14. <hi>Be thou an example of believers, in word, in converſation, in charity, in faith, in purity; till I come give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, neglect not the gift which was given thee by prophecy,</hi> &amp;c. Meditate upon <hi>theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them.</hi> Art thou called to be a Miniſter? <hi>Stir up, neglect not the gift of God which is in thee; ſtudy, meditate of theſe things.</hi> There are means to be uſed for thy improvement in thy miniſterial abilities: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural means, that is, exerciſe; by preaching, thou ſhalt learn to preach, and by praying thou ſhalt improve in the gift of prayer:
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:192227:238"/>
                     <hi>Moral means,</hi> theſe are <hi>ſearching the Scriptures, ſtudy, comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual, Meditation: Religious,</hi> that is, <hi>Prayer.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith of the work of the Miniſtry, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> Whatſoever thy gifts and abilities be, thou hadſt need profit and improve in them. If thou wilt improve them, and obtain the bleſſing from God of a further fitting thee for the work to which thou art called, it lyeth upon thee to uſe ſuch means as God hath appointed in order to that end. <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to ſay, that there are three things which make a Divine, <hi>Temptations, Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Prayer;</hi> the two latter I am ſure muſt be much our own work; we muſt not expect that God ſhould immediately qualifie us from Heaven, as he did in the firſt Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, by the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. God having ſo ſupplied the firſt neceſſities of his Church, when the generality of the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel were illiterate men, and wanted advantages of education (which then lay on the other ſide), hath ſince that time left his Miniſters to the uſe and application of more ordinary means, in the uſe of which he ordinarily concurreth with his bleſſing, and not otherwiſe. The ſame might be ſaid of more inferiour relations, ſuch as thoſe of conjugal and parental relations. God ordinarily when he calleth men to them, doth ſute men with ſpirits fit for them; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of their own indeavours muſt be underſtood, with which God will concur with his own bleſſing. Art thou therefore called to the relation of an husband or wife? and doeſt thou fear thy own ſpirit (the like alſo may be ſaid of a parental relation)? Having entred into it, asking counſel of Gods Word, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the rules of it, thou haſt reaſon to truſt God for the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of thy ſpirit for it, and the duties of it; but ſtill uſing all due means, which on thy part are to be uſed, ſuch as the <hi>mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thoſe paſſions</hi> which appear to thee moſt indiſpoſing thee for the duties of ſuch relations, applying thine heart, what in thee lyeth, to them, and conſtant and fervent prayer to God to make up in thee, what thou findeſt wanting in thy ſelf for the due managery of them according to the Will of God.</p>

                  <p>I Have entred into a large field. How great a Volume might be wrote, <hi>de obſervandis Providentiae,</hi> concerning the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable things of Divine Providence. I have ſeen a picture (one of thoſe you call kitchin-pieces) concerning which it hath been propoſed to me, that for ſo many hours I ſhould view it as curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly as I could; yet the propoſer would for any wager under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſhew me ſomething in it which I did not obſerve. Truly Providence is ſuch a thing, I can never look upon it, I can never take the motions of it into my thoughts, but ſome new obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tendreth it ſelf to my thoughts. I muſt turn my eyes from this wonderful work, for I ſee they will not be ſatisfied with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my mind will never be filled with obſerving. Many obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations I have already made, and behold <hi>yet a troop cometh.</hi> But they have all a tendency to the augmentation of ſpiritual Wiſdom in my own, and your ſouls. <hi>Whoſo is wiſe, will obſerve theſe things</hi> (ſaith my Text) they have a tendency to make you to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> Where can we be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employed? what can we better do? Methinks I could ſay with the diſciple upon the Mount of transfiguration: <hi>It is good for us to be here, let us build our ſelves tabernacles:</hi> One for me the ſpeaker, others <hi>for you that are to be my hearers.</hi> Let me therefore go on. Doth therefore any of you ſay unto me, <hi>Seer, What ſeeſt thou?</hi> I anſwer, yet once more. I obſerve in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Actual Providence,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 21. <hi>That God commandeth his ſenſible bleſſings moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe individual perſons, and thoſe ſocieties of the children of
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:192227:239"/>men, that live in the moſt exact conformity to the Divine Rule.</hi> Here are two terms in this Obſervation, upon the Explication of which I will a little inſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is meant by ſenſible bleſſings?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What I mean by the moſt exact conformity to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Rule?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Good things are diſtributed ſeveral ways, in order to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of them by our underſtandings: amongſt others this is one diſtribution of them, they are either <hi>ſenſible,</hi> or <hi>inſenſible.</hi> By ſenſible good things, I underſtand ſuch as are obvious to our ſenſes, and perceptible by them. By <hi>inſenſible,</hi> ſuch as have a reality of good in them, but yet not ſuch as our ſenſes diſcern. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted,</hi> but yet afflictions are not <hi>ſenſible good things:</hi> all ſuch are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our joy and delight. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>no affliction at the preſent is joyous, but grievous, but it bringeth forth the quiet fruit of righteouſneſs, to them that are exerciſed therewith.</hi> But I ſay God commandeth ſenſible bleſſings moſtly, upon perſons and ſocieties living in the beſt ſquare, and moſt exact conformity unto the Divine Rule.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Further yet, <hi>Senſible bleſſings</hi> are capable of a <hi>double notion,</hi> they are either <hi>ſuch as are obvious only to the inward ſenſes of thoſe that are made partakers of them:</hi> ſuch are <hi>peace of conſcience, joy in the holy God;</hi> that ſerenity and tranquillity of mind, which is the effect of righteouſneſs, the new-name which none knoweth, but he that hath it: but there are other good things, which are the objects of our more exteriour ſenſes; ſuch are <hi>health, proſperity, ſucceſs in trade,</hi> &amp;c. bleſſings in relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now my Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is, That the <hi>Actual Providence</hi> of God doth uſually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute good things of this nature, to ſuch perſons, and ſuch ſocieties of perſons as live to the trueſt ſquare, and exacteſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Divine Rule.</p>
                  <p>That is a general, and muſt be opened alſo. The Divine Rule, as to families and perſons, is of a great compaſs, but the whole of it is reducible to three heads: <hi>viz. Piety, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> under each of theſe are ſeveral particulars, but none which fall not under one of theſe generals.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Piety</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>internal,</hi> and external acts of homage which we owe unto God. Our internal acts are, <hi>Fear, Faith, Love.</hi> Our external acts are principally <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="440" facs="tcp:192227:240"/>2. Juſtice <hi>is an habit, diſpoſing us to give every one their due.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. By <hi>Charity,</hi> I mean here mutual brotherly love. Now look where theſe things beſt proſper, there God commandeth moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible bleſſings in the ordinary motions of his Provilence. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances may be exceptions from a general rule: but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily it is ſo. What the Pſalmiſt ſaith of one of theſe, is true of all, <hi>There God commandeth the bleſſing,</hi> Pſal. 133.3. There, where? it may be interpreted with reference to the words, which immediately precedes, <hi>the mountain of Zion;</hi> but I take it to be far more proper to refer it to the firſt verſe, which contains the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Pſalm: <hi>O</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>how good, and how pleaſant a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</hi> This he illuſtrateth by two ſimilitudes; the one is <hi>the oyl which was poured upon the head of Aaron, and ran down to the skirts of his garment.</hi> Verſ. 2. The other <hi>is the dew of Hermon, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended on the mountain of Zion, for</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>there the Lord commandeth the bleſſing, even life for evermore.</hi> There, where? <hi>where brethren together dwell in unity:</hi> it is as true, there, where Religion is exerciſed, where all relations give their due one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>there God commandeth the bleſſing.</hi> Now for the proof of this, I ſhall but appeal to your experience, and what you ſee every day.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Look into the world, there you ſhall ſee <hi>nations of various complexions,</hi> ſome in which the <hi>true God is worſhipped in a true manner; others wherein Devils are worſhipped, or ſtocks or ſtones:</hi> or if the <hi>true God</hi> be indeed worſhipped, yet it is not as he hath directed, but by <hi>images and ſuperſtitious rites and obſervances;</hi> ſome nations that are nothing elſe but <hi>rapine</hi> and <hi>violence,</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> full of <hi>ſtrife and hatred,</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> and <hi>wars,</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions.</hi> You on the other ſide will ſee other Nations, amongſt whom the true God is worſhipped, and that in a true manner, where are good laws againſt oppreſſion and injuſtice, and for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive and commutative Juſtice, where men are not hunted and perſecuted for their conſciences towards God. Mark if God doth not <hi>command the bleſſing of riches, trade,</hi> &amp;c. more upon the latter than the former. It is true, ſome of thoſe Countreys where theſe iniquities are found, are naturally richer than others, in minerals, and the Native Commodities of the Countrey; but for adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious riches, which come from Trade and Commerce, and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſible bleſſings, obſerve if they be not poured out in a
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:192227:240"/>greater plenty upon Nations, that in matters of Religion, civil Juſtice and Unity, have been regulated by laws conformable to the Word of God, than upon other Nations, where none of theſe things have been regarded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you will ſtraiten your proſpect, look upon any Cities, or Towns, or any kind of political ſocieties, you will ſee ſome of theſe places, ſuch as <hi>Egypt</hi> was, of which <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>The fear of God was not in that place,</hi> where all their Religion is to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thoſe that have any thing of Religion in them. No rules of juſtice and brotherly love are obſerved, but they are full of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and oppreſſion, and fraud; there is nothing in them but the inhabitants biting and devouring one another, the cry of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed is in their ſtreet. Other places you will find, where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is cheriſhed and countenanced; where the word of God is livelily and powerfully preached, and men live in ſome ſeeming awe of it; where rules of civil Juſtice are obſerved, and men can have Juſtice in Courts of Judicature, and the people live in peace and amity one with another; obſerve again which of theſe God moſt commandeth his bleſſing upon. I might appeal to your like obſervation, concerning families and particular perſons. But it is no more than every one may obſerve. Conſider what an Hell upon Earth, ſome Cities, ſome Families are in compariſon of others, and ſee what makes the difference both in the <hi>beauty</hi> and in the <hi>proſperity</hi> of them: And it needs muſt be ſo, if you pleaſe to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The natural tendency of theſe things to ſo happy products.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That God in purſuance of his many promiſes, doth there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the bleſſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the firſt place it will appear to be but a reaſonable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Providence, there to diſtribute ſenſible bleſſings, where men either in their ſingle capacities, or in their political ſocieties live in the exacteſt ſquare and conformity to the Divine Rule, in matters of <hi>diſtributive and commutative juſtice, and brotherly love and amity;</hi> if you but conſider <hi>the natural tendency of theſe things to promove the felicity of any perſons or ſocieties,</hi> together with the direct tendency of a contrary converſe to the ruin and undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> or amicable living each with other, are the two <hi>pillars</hi> of humane ſociety, as the Scripture ſaith of <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah, Ruth.</hi> 4.11. <hi>They two did build up the houſe of Iſrael:</hi> ſo it muſt be ſaid of theſe two, <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:192227:241"/>love,</hi> they are the two things which build up humane ſociety; and the Nation which keepeth not up theſe two pillars, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth them not in thoſe due repairs, which the luſts and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men will make them to ſtand in a daily need of, will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall under the ruins of them; it muſt neceſſarily be <hi>a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, which</hi> (as our Saviour hath told us) <hi>cannot ſtand.</hi> Where the firſt, <hi>viz. Juſtice</hi> faileth, no man knoweth what to call his own; every mans eſtate is expoſed to the <hi>fraud, violence,</hi> and rapines of his wicked neighbour. Where <hi>Amity</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> (which is the other) fails, men are continually bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and devouring, rending, and tearing one another; none are willing to trade or traffique, or to have any commerce with any ſuch people; or if they have, it is ſo ſparingly, and with ſo much caution, as is no way conſiſtent with that liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that mutual confidence each in another, which ſuch a ſtate requireth, as is capable of thoſe kind of bleſſings, or in a rational or probable way to receive them. You cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how every one is willing to be acquainted, and to deal with perſons that have a reputation; for moral honeſty and matters of juſtice in bargains, and barters, in buyings and ſellings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. Now the outward bleſſing of riches and proſperity, as to buſineſs, depending much upon ſociety, good underſtandings betwixt each of other, and good opinions of perſons engaged in the ſame ſocieties, which may diſpoſe men to juſt and mutual confidences each in other; it is not at all to be wondred at, if thoſe places and perſons thrive beſt, amongſt whom theſe are found which are the rational means agreeing to ſuch an end. The like might be ſaid of other moral vertues, ſuch as are <hi>temperance</hi> and <hi>ſobriety,</hi> being rational means, tending to the preſervation of mens <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>health,</hi> which are other ſenſible bleſſings. It is not at all to be wondred, that theſe bleſſings which are the end, do naturally follow the proper means, even as the thred followeth the needle in the hands of the ſempſtreſs. God hath ſo ordered it, that ends ſhall be ordinarily obtained in the uſe of means, always ſuppoſing the ordinary Providence of God, which muſt give the bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any means uſed in order to any end.</p>

I ſhall only commend this obſervation to you, <hi>That you ſhall quite through the Scripture find the execution of juſtice and judgment, made one term that God puts upon people, in order to the receiving of any mercy from him, and injuſtice, violence, and oppreſſion, conſtantly enumerated as thoſe ſins, to which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed all the threatnings of taking away thoſe temporal bleſſings which a Nation doth enjoy.</hi> Indeed, unleſs prophaneneſs and irreligion, or idolatrous and undue worſhip of God, almoſt all the ſins for which you find threatnings of the deprival of temporal ſenſible bleſſings are reducible to one of theſe heads, either being failers in matters of civil juſtice, or of that brotherly love and amity which God hath required. So that this is as a very ordinary, ſo a moſt reaſonable motion of Divine Providence, and what we cannot but in reaſon expect from its hand. But I come to the Application of this diſcourſe.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. As my other Obſervations, ſo this alſo is of great uſe to us, to increaſe in us <hi>ſpiritual wiſdom,</hi> and to make us <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To increaſe in us ſpiritual wiſdom.</hi> Wiſdom is a practical habit, diſpoſing us to order our affairs in the beſt manner, in order to <hi>our own good.</hi> Good is that which every man deſires; <hi>who will ſhew us any good,</hi> is the general language of the world. There be many (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) that ſay, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> And though the hearts of Gods People be after <hi>ſpiritual good, Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me:</hi> yet this is not that good which <hi>the many</hi> look after, but the increaſe of their corn, and wine, and oyl. We will take men at
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:192227:242"/>that advantage, and ſuppoſe the queſtion to be what courſe a man ſhould take to be bleſſed with corn, wine and oyl, with the good things of this life, long life, riches, trade, ſucceſs in worldly affairs: if this obſervation be true, the beſt courſe, is for Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Cities, Perſons to govern themſelves, by the Divine Rule, to ſet up and promove the profeſſion and practice of Religion; to execute juſtice and judgement, to live in brotherly love, unity and amity one with another. Whoſo therefore would be wiſe for himſelf, according to the worlds meaſures of wiſdom, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to this: hence it is that in Scripture, and eſpecially in the book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> the ſinner is called a fool, the godly man is counted a wiſe man; and the truth is, whether perſons conſider themſelves, as beings ordained to an eternity, or meerly as fleſh and blood, and bodily compoſitions, who (as is natural to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) have a natural deſire to live, as long as they can, and as free from pain and miſery as they can, and with as many ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and advantage of life as they can, I ſay, which way ſoever men will conſider themſelves, or whatſoever they will place their ultimate felicity in; whether it be in the enjoyment and viſion of God to eternity, or in living long, and happy; Still it is their higheſt wiſdom, both in their perſonal capacities, and in their relative capacities, as they ſtand related to others in their politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or oeconomical relations, as Princes, Subjects, Husbands, Wives, Parents, Children, Maſters or Servants, to govern them according to the rules, and by the ſquare of the word of God. Now the obſervation, I ſay, of theſe ordinary diſpoſitions of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, muſt therefore be exceedingly conducive to the increaſe of ſpiritual wiſdom in our ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Obſervation will alſo teach us, <hi>to underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> The glory of God is by all Chriſtians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly, the end of mans creation, and ought to be made the end of his action; but herein appeareth the tranſcendent goodneſs of God, That no man can <hi>act for his glory,</hi> but he muſt alſo by the ſame actions conſult his own good, and be wiſe for himſelf. So that in truth there is no man ſerveth God for nothing, but in the ſame action, by, and in which he obeyeth God, he alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth his own life, health, riches, ſucceſs in buſineſs, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever can contribute, not only to his eternal felicity, but to his felicity, and happineſs in this life. Now how wonderfully doth this ſpeak the love of God to the children of men? Every mans
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:192227:242"/>reaſon will tell him, that there is a duty of homage, and honour which is due from man unto God. God is our Creator, we are his creatures. In him we live, move and have our being, and equally depend upon him for our preſervation, and ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his Providence, as derive from him as our Creator and the firſt Author of beings to us. Now as it is in the power of any man in the cauſe, to preſcribe the honour and homage which ſhall be grateful and acceptable to him; ſo undoubtedly it was in the power of God, and free to him, to have preſcribed us an homage and ſervice that ſhould have impeached, and prejudiced, or ſome way diſadvantaged us, as to our external felicity, and the accommodations of this life, which ſhould make it ſweet to us. But in this ſee the great <hi>loving kindneſs of the Lord,</hi> That no man can poſſibly at more advantage ſerve himſelf, and the good of his Family, or City, or Country, than by ſerving God, and indeavouring to ſquare his whole converſe, to the rule of Gods word; governing himſelf by the Scriptures, and the rules of life which it gives: nor doth God require any thing of us that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to that true Reaſon which is in every man. All the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, do but pinch us in the exerciſe of our <hi>Luſts and Paſſions:</hi> the exerciſe of which (if they have their liberty, and were not by a Divine Law reſtrained,) would have no better an effect, from their natural tendency than the imbittering of our lives, by aches and pains, and grievous diſeaſes; by the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, croſneſs, and undutifulneſs of our relations; by a liberty to injuſtice, fraud, deceit, and oppreſſion. This is a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Gods loving kindneſs, that in his rules for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of us, he hath twiſted our intereſt with his own, and made it neceſſary, for thoſe who moſt conſult his honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, moſt to conſult their own good and happineſs, and that not only as to a life to come, but as to this life alſo.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. We may learn from hence the true reaſon, why the moſt of men <hi>are curſed with the want of temporal bleſſings;</hi> I ſay the moſt of men, for what I told you before muſt be remembred; that from theſe general rules, we muſt always except thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſes, where God either for the puniſhment of <hi>ſome ſins</hi> in his people, or for the trial of their faith and patience, (having reſerved a better portion for them in the world to come) doth think fit to exerciſe them, with the denial of the ſenſible bleſſings of this life. But ſetting aſide thoſe caſes, the general cauſe is,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:192227:243"/>their not living up to that conformity, or ſquare, to the Divine rule to which they ought to live; but either failing in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of piety, and exerciſe of Religion, to which the Divine law bindeth them, or in the duties of <hi>probity</hi> and moral honeſty, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, temperance, ſobriety, unity and amity, which the ſame Law doth require of them. What wonder is it to ſee the lazy ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>poor?</hi> Hath not God ſaid to him, Prov. 6.9. <hi>How long wilt thou ſleep, O ſluggard, when wilt thou ariſe out of ſleep?</hi> v. 11. <hi>So ſhall thy poverty come, as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</hi> Or to ſee Oppreſſors, and Gripers of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-poor: God hath told them, Prov. 10.15. <hi>The deſtruction of the poor is their poverty.</hi> Or to ſee the penurious man grow poor; hath not God told us, <hi>That to withhold more than is meet tendeth to poverty,</hi> Prov. 11.24? What wonder is it to ſee <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,</hi> and <hi>Gluttons poor?</hi> Hath not God ſaid, <hi>The Drunkard and Glutton ſhall come to poverty, and drouſineſs ſhall cloth a man with rags, Prov.</hi> 23.21? what wonder is it to ſee thoſe that are <hi>companions of leud perſons, drunkards, adulterers, Gameſters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>grow poor?</hi> Hath not God again ſaid, Prov. 28.19. <hi>That he who followeth after vain perſons ſhall have poverty enough?</hi> O <hi>Iſrael</hi> (ſaith God by the Prophet <hi>Hoſeah) Thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help.</hi> Hoſ. 13.9. it is true as to mens eternal ruine, but the Prophet there primarily ſpeaks of mens <hi>deſtroying themſelves,</hi> by being the cauſes of puniſhments in this life to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: men deſtroy their own lives, healths, bodys, by drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gluttony, uncleanneſs; their eſtates by ſloth and luxury, the comforts of their own lives, by giving an unbridled liberty to their luſts, and paſſions, indulging the luſtings of their fleſh. The righteous God is not to be accuſed for any of theſe things. He hath given men a righteous law, which to their reaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth it ſelf to be holy, ſpiritual, juſt, and good, but they are carnal, ſold unto ſin, ſlaves to their appetites, to their ſenſual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; and either ruine themſelves by their irreligious, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral behaviours, and doing thoſe things over, which if God had not by his ſevere threatnings in his word, hung a ſword of Divine Vengeance; yet in themſelves, and of their own nature they have a tendency to deſtroy life, health, to waſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume eſtates, and to deprive them of all thoſe good things which may accommodate their lives, and make them ſweet, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to them: and in the day of their affliction they muſt lay
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:192227:243"/>the fault upon themſelves, and excuſe God in the motions of his Providence, acknowledging that it hath but fulfilled his word, and brought to paſs the juſt threatnings of his word; nay not ſo only, but that it hath only brought natural things to paſs in a natural order, and by natural ways and means; ſuffering poor ſinful wretches, to walk in their own ways, and then penally producing the effects, the natural and proper effects of ſuch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and giving them the fruit of their own doings, filling them with their own ways, and with that calamity and miſery, which they like fooliſh people have pulled down upon their own heads, and could reaſonably expect no other iſſue than what they meet with.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. In the laſt place, how doth this call upon all men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of holy <hi>David</hi> to make the <hi>word of God a lamp unto their feet, and a light unto their paths? Not to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world, but transformed through the renewing of their minds, that they may prove what is the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God,</hi> Rom. 12.2. You remember I reduced the whole will of God concerning us to three heads: indeed two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all, 1. <hi>Piety towards God.</hi> 2. <hi>Probity</hi> or honeſty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation before men; now that laſt comprehendeth all acts of <hi>juſtice,</hi> and <hi>charity, or kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Brotherly love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let Magiſtrates command their Subjects, Maſters of Families command their Eamilies the fear of the Lord; and ſet examples of Religion before them; let them give people liberty to ſerve and worſhip God, and exhort and encourage them to do ſo. Let them reſtrain irreligion, and prophaneneſs; obſerve if thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thoſe Towns and Cities, thoſe Families do not moſt thrive, amongſt whom God is moſt ſtrictly ſerved and worſhipped; if in thoſe places where there is leaſt of Religion, there be not alſo moſt beggery and poverty, like an armed man ruſhing in upon them. Hark what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, Prov. 3.13. <hi>Happy is the man that findeth wiſdom, and the man that getteth underſtanding.</hi> v. 16. <hi>Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let every one maintain <hi>juſtice and judgement,</hi> giving to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one their due, according to the capacities in which they are: Magiſtrates truly diſpenſe diſtributive juſtice, giving out rewards to <hi>good men,</hi> and inflicting puniſhments upon evil men, according
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:192227:244"/>to their merits; diſcountenancing all violence and oppreſſion, all luxury, and intemperance; in ſhort, all manner of ſin, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery. Let private perſons give their due to their Superiors, their Inferiors and Equals: for what is that which God requires, but <hi>to deal juſtly?</hi> Let them be juſt in their dealigns one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not cozening, and cheating, and defrauding one another.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Finally, Let all men according to the Apoſtles exhortation, <hi>ſtudy to be quiet,</hi> to forbear <hi>biting, and devouring one another;</hi> and indeavour to live peaceably and at unity, <hi>following peace with all men,</hi> and doing what good offices lie in their power each to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the command of God. All theſe things now have promiſes of <hi>ſpiritual bleſſings,</hi> and eternal <hi>happineſs of a life to come;</hi> but if that be too far off, for men who <hi>have not faith,</hi> to be affected with, and moved by; there are, you ſee, other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to incourage theſe things, even promiſes of ſenſible goods, <hi>length of days, riches and honor,</hi> and whatſoever our ſenſitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite deſireth, and calleth good, as grateful, and acceptable to it. Mal. 3.10. <hi>Bring you (ſaith God) all the tythes into the Storehouſe, that there may be meat in my Houſe; and prove me now herewith (ſaith the Lord of hoſts): If I will not open unto you the windows of Heaven, and pour you out a bleſſing, that there ſhall not be room to receive it; and I will rebuke the devourer for your ſakes, and he ſhall not deſtroy the fruits of the ground, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the vine caſt her fruit, before the time, in the field (ſaith the Lord of hoſts).</hi> The Prophet there mentioneth but one thing, <hi>not robbing God of his tythes,</hi> but certainly it is to be underſtood <hi>ſynecdochically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may certainly (by warrant of that Text) ſpeak to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all families, all perſons. <hi>Worſhip God, ſet up the practice of Religion in all your Societies; do juſtly,</hi> ſtudy peace and amity one with another, and try God herewith, if he will not open to you the windows of Heaven, and pour you out a bleſſing, that there ſhall not be room enough to receive it. We complain that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty is breaking in upon us, like an armed man; Trade faileth, Eſtates waſte, men every-where come to beggery. We muſt lay all the fault upon our ſelves; God is not altered in the courſe of his Providence; the change is in us. The world as to matters of juſtice, is grown but one <hi>great cheat:</hi> every one ſtudies by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to oppreſs his neighbour, the greater devours the leſs, like the fiſh in the Sea: men in their Trades and dealings, do but ſtudy
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:192227:244"/>to circumvent one another, and to go beyond them in buyings and ſellings, and bargains and exchanges. Men are grown gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally like <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> every mans tongue and hand is againſt his Brother, and his Brother's is againſt him again. God never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a bleſſing upon any part of the world that was of ſuch a complexion. Let me conclude all with the Apoſtles words, 1 Pet. 3.10, 11, 12. He hath been perſwading in that Chapter, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative duties of <hi>Wives,</hi> and <hi>Husbands,</hi> in the ſeven firſt verſes; verſ. 8. he ſpeaks more generally, <hi>Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compaſſion one of another; love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendring evil for evil, or railing for railing,</hi> &amp;c. Now mark the Argument he uſeth, verſ. 10. <hi>For he that will love life, and ſee good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips, that they ſpeak no guile: let him eſchew evil and do good; let him ſeek peace, and enſue it; for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry; but the face of the Lord is againſt them that do evil.</hi> And this is demonſtrated by the frowns of his Providence upon them. The Apoſtle takes this out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. So that you ſee it is the Doctrine of both Teſtaments, and what you ſhall obſerve, God confirming every day in the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues of his Providence daily fulfilling his word. But I ſhall add no more upon this Obſervation, and alſo here ſhut up my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes upon the <hi>Obſervanda Providentiae.</hi> And hereafter paſs on to the laſt part of my intended Diſcourſe, concerning the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I Am now come to the laſt part of my deſigned Diſcourſe. In my firſt, I aſſerted the Doctrine of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> againſt ancient and modern <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> I opened it in the nature and principal <hi>Acts</hi> of it. In the Second, I 1. ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you the ſpecialties of it. 2. Wherein you muſt ſtand ſtill, and <hi>admire</hi> it in the depths, and unſearchable things of it. 3. I directed you how to make ſome obſervations upon the more ordinary and intelligible motions of it. I am now come to open ſome <hi>hard Chapters,</hi> in this great and excellent book; and to reconcile this great work of God, to his moſt <hi>holy nuture,</hi> and that <hi>infinite juſtice goodneſs, wiſdom and truth,</hi> which are inſeparable from it. I take it to be a work worthy of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, to make a <hi>rationale divinorum operum;</hi> to give a reaſonable account of the Divine works, humbly adoring God in them, yet
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:192227:245"/>inquiring into them, and that, <hi>non tam ad mentis otium, quam ad cordis uſum</hi> (as <hi>Nierembergius</hi> ſaith) not ſo much for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of our wits, as for the uſe of our ſouls. It advantageth the works of God to our ſouls, when they appear no other than reaſonable to us; and I think the ſame Author ſpeaketh well, when he ſaith, <hi>Nullum puto conſilium Divinum, cujus non aliqua ratio reddi poteſt, nullum cujus omnis reddatur, ita &amp; inſcrutabilia ſunt divina opera, &amp; digna ut ſcrutemur, &amp; facilia;</hi> that is, I do not think any Divine Counſel can be named, of which we may not give ſome reaſonable account, though there be likewiſe none, of which we can give a perfect account; ſo as the Divine works, are at the ſame time both <hi>unſearchable,</hi> and alſo worthy and eaſie, <hi>to be ſearched out.</hi> I ſhall not ſo much as propound to my ſelf or you, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all the ſeeming <hi>riddles</hi> and <hi>difficulties</hi> of <hi>Actual Providence.</hi> I ſhall only diſcourſe ſome of them, which ſeem moſt obvious, and readieſt to ſtumble our thoughts; and thoſe which I ſhall ſpeak to, ſhall chiefly refer to theſe heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The exhibition of the Covenant of works, after the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Eternal Covenant of Redemption and Grace; and the exhibition or tender of grace indefinitely to all, after the decree of election,</hi> and the <hi>fall of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The permiſſion of ſin, and ſo much ſin in the world.</hi>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpeak to divers ſeeming difficulties, that will fall under theſe four heads; and at this time begin with the firſt of theſe.</p>
                  <p>It was one of the firſt acts of Divine Providence that we read of, immediately ſucceeding the creation. Gen. 2.15. <hi>And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dreſs it, and to keep it; and the Lord God commanded the man, ſaying, of every tree of the garden thou maiſt freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye.</hi> Under that threatning is a <hi>promiſe of life,</hi> upon condition of <hi>obedience,</hi> as to the Law of God written in <hi>Adams</hi> heart. So to that poſitive Law given him for the trial of his <hi>obedience.</hi> I ſhall not engage my ſelf deeply in the queſtion, what <hi>death</hi> it is which God there threatneth to <hi>Adam.</hi> I am aware of the varieties of opinions: I take it for granted, that whatſoever falleth under the notion of <hi>death</hi> in Scripture is all
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:192227:246"/>comprehended under that threatning, <hi>In dying thou ſhalt dye</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe), which we tranſlate, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely dye.</hi> The threatning mentioneth neither one death nor another, but is indefinite, and of the ſame force, as if <hi>univerſal,</hi> and it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly uſed in Scripture, to ſignifie all kind of death, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. and in many other places, and out of doubt there falleth under that threatning whatſoever was contrary to the felicity of <hi>Adam</hi> in that eſtate. I do therefore agree with the ancient and modern Divines, who underſtand death, <hi>Corporal, Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> there threatned in caſe of diſobedience, and life, <hi>Corporal, Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> there promiſed in caſe of obedience. Now hence ariſeth a great difficulty, there were two great <hi>Acts of God, with relation to man,</hi> paſſed before this Act of Providence. 1. <hi>The decree of Election,</hi> by which God had not only ſtated the number of thoſe that ſhould be ſaved, <hi>but choſen us in him before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world,</hi> Epheſ. 1.6. 2. <hi>The eternal Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Grace.</hi> By which the ſalvation of man was ſetled, to be obtained not by <hi>working,</hi> but by <hi>believing in him that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ungodly;</hi> that is, not to be obtained by the merits of our own works, <hi>but by the merits of Chriſt,</hi> imputed to us for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and to be by faith apprehended and applied. Now here ariſeth the difficulty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How it could conſiſt with the <hi>wiſdom and truth of God, having thus in his eternal counſels reſolved, that there ſhould be no other name under heaven, no other way or means of ſalvation, but by believing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to propound a way of ſalvation to be obtained by mens working and obedience to the Law of God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he did aforeknow that man would break this firſt Covenant, and no man ſhould be ſaved upon the terms of it.</hi> That I might ſpeak ſomething to ſhew you the reaſonableneſs of this motion I have made choice of this Text, in which you have,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An <hi>aſſertion. The Scripture hath concluded all under wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>end</hi> or <hi>reaſon of the thing aſſerted, That the promiſe by faith in Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> A text much parallel to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. <hi>He hath concluded all in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that he might have mercy upon all.</hi> This Text ſaith, the Scripture hath done it; that text ſaith, <hi>God hath done it,</hi> there's no contradiction in it, the Scriptures are the word of God; <hi>if the Scripture hath concluded all under wrath, God hath done it.</hi> Now how hath the Scripture done this? or how hath God done it, but
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:192227:246"/>by <hi>firſt making man in his own image, writing his law in his heart;</hi> then adding that <hi>poſitive law,</hi> forbidding him to <hi>eat of the tree of forbidden fruit;</hi> after this ſuffering him to eat, by which not <hi>Adam</hi> only, but all mankind (then in him) loſt the Image of God, and all <hi>were concluded under ſin:</hi> and to what purpoſe was all this? The text telleth us, <hi>That the promiſe by faith in Jeſus Chriſt might be given to all that believe.</hi> If you pleaſe, I ſhall make my whole diſcourſe, but a demonſtration of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <p>Prop. <hi>That God in infinite wiſdom, by his Providence gave out the Law or Covenant of works, ſuffering the firſt man to fall; and all (in him) by the fall, to be concluded under wrath.</hi> My buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be to ſhew you the exceeding reaſonableneſs and wiſdom of God in this diſpenſation. I ſhall open this to you in five or ſix particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It neither was, nor could be Gods deſign in it, that any one ſoul ſhould be ſaved by the fulfilling of it, but that he might by it make way for the exhibition of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> which is indeed what the text ſaith, <hi>That the promiſe by faith in Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> It is manifeſt that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any part of Gods deſign and counſel in his firſt exhibiting the Covenant of Works (or making it rather, for that was made immediately betwixt God and <hi>Adam</hi> in paradiſe), that any ſoul ſhould be ſaved by it, for as to this the Apoſtles words are true, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If there had been a law, which could have given life, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the law.</hi> The Apoſtle in that text may be ſpeaking of the law given to man in his lapſed eſtate; but I ſay it is as true concerning the law given in the eſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency. <hi>But why could not the law give righteouſneſs?</hi> As to our lapſed eſtate the Apoſtle tells you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Becauſe it was made weak through our fleſh.</hi> But this cannot be ſaid of man in his eſtate of innocency and original integrity, he then certainly had a <hi>poſſe non peccare;</hi> but then the eternal Counſel of God hindred, who had fixed the ſalvation of man upon another foot, having from eternity <hi>ſet apart the ſon of his love, for the head of his elect, and choſen us in him, and ordained mans ſalvation by faith in him.</hi> The law given in innocency, in reſpect of it ſelf might have given life, what ſhould have hindred? Eternal life was then the gift of God, and God had annexed the promiſe of it to mans obedience; but it is as true, that if we reſpect the eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:192227:247"/>of God, having <hi>fore ordained</hi> men to ſalvation upon a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace</hi> made with the Son of his love; even that law could not give life, it was not conſiſtent with our being <hi>choſen in Chriſt.</hi> In ſhort, the power in the law to give life, may be conſidered in a threefold habitude or reſpect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>With reſpect to the law it ſelf.</hi> Thus the law could have given life, if man had kept it; the law given to <hi>Adam</hi> could in this ſenſe have given life, the law afterward upon <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> could have in this reſpect have given life. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>keep the Commandments.</hi> As to our lapſed eſtate, the Apoſtle ſaith no more than, <hi>that it is weak through our fleſh;</hi> that is, becauſe we are not able to keep it; or elſe, ſecondly,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The law may be conſidered with reſpect unto man;</hi> and he is conſiderable, either in his <hi>primitive ſtate of innocency,</hi> or in his <hi>lapſed eſtate:</hi> if we conſider man in the <hi>firſt eſtate,</hi> the law again <hi>might have given life;</hi> for it was the perfect rule of God at that time concerning man, and man had a power to keep it ſo, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hindred, but that the law might have given life: but indeed if we conſider man in his <hi>lapſed eſtate,</hi> the caſe is quite otherwiſe; for man <hi>was now made weak through his fleſh,</hi> and unable to keep that law, which yet approved it ſelf to his reaſon in that ſtate, as holy, ſpiritual, juſt, and good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But (thirdly) the law may be conſidered <hi>in its power to give life, with reſpect to Gods counſels and purpoſes, fixed concerning the end and means of mans ſalvation from all eternity;</hi> and ſo the law never had a power to give life, that is, it never was any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God in order to ſuch an end, nor ever was deſigned by God as an effectual means in order to that end: nor indeed is it poſſible that it ſhould, for then it had been poſſible that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God could have been fruſtrated of its intendment, for never yet was any ſaved by any works of their own: But the <hi>giving of the law to man in innocency, was not,</hi> nor could be intended by God further than as a proper mean for the exhibition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace: and for this it was ſo proper, that upon this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that the <hi>elect</hi> were (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>choſen in Chriſt before the foundation of the world,</hi> and that a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> was made for mens ſalvation through faith, and believing in Chriſt; yet it is very difficult to imagine how the Providence of God could have brought this about otherwiſe, than by firſt
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:192227:247"/>making a Covenant of Works with man, then ſuffering him to fall and violate it, and ſo be concluded under ſin and wrath; I ſay it is hard to imagine, how otherwiſe God could have given out the promiſe to them that ſhould believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This I ſhall yet further open to you in five or ſix particulars. To this end I ſhall intreat you to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That man was created in a ſtate of innocency.</hi> The Scripture ſaith ſo, <hi>that in the image of God he created man,</hi> and that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to us by the Apoſtle, to have been in <hi>knowledg, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>holineſs;</hi> and indeed it was impoſſible, that he ſhould come out of the hands of God, other than <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>righteous.</hi> Divines ſay, the Image of God lay in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, and that dominion over the Creatures, with which God inveſted him: the laſt indeed was not neceſſary, but coming immediately out of the hands of an holy God, it was neceſſary that he ſhould be created in <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>holineſs.</hi> God ſaw all <hi>that he had made that it was good,</hi> good according to the nature. Every ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate and ſenſitive creature had a goodneſs ſuitable to its nature, a natural goodneſs; man muſt alſo have a goodneſs ſuitable to his being, and conſidering him a rational creature, he muſt have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goodneſs, a purity, and integrity, a freedom from any ſpots or ſtains of ſin, and ſo conſequentially from any guilt of ſin. <hi>God made man upright:</hi> this is a confeſſed principle, and needeth no further enlargement of diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Man in this ſtate was <hi>not capable of ſalvation in that way wherein God had foreordained the ſalvation of men,</hi> viz. by a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: the whole need not a phyſician, but the ſick;</hi> men muſt be <hi>loſt,</hi> before they are <hi>found;</hi> they muſt be captives, before they are capable of <hi>Redemption;</hi> they muſt be <hi>unrighteous,</hi> before they can be capable of a bring <hi>made righteous.</hi> Chriſt came not (as himſelf telleth us) to call the righteous, but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Man could no other way become loſt, than by ſome actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion:</hi> The firſt man could have no original guiltineſs. We are guilty by imputation, as we were all in the firſt man, and ſinned in him, and ſell with him; but <hi>Adam</hi> being the firſt man, could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive no guilt from any proparent. We become guilty by <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi> deriving guilt from our immediate parents: we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſin, and in iniquity did our mother bring us forth, and ſo we <hi>were by nature the children of wrath.</hi> But <hi>Adam</hi> came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:192227:248"/>out of the hands of God, and therefore muſt neceſſarily be without <hi>ſpot</hi> or <hi>wrinkle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. From hence followeth in the fourth place, <hi>the neceſſity of a law to be given unto man in his ſtate of innocency: For</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> ſin being the tranſgreſſion of the law. Now this Law, with the promiſe annexed to it, was the Covenant of Works on Gods part; and the reſtipulation on mans part muſt be preſumed, or man had been a tranſgreſſor before the fall, by a rebellion to the Divine Will: and this formally maketh up the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> God promiſing him life upon condition of his Obedience, and man accepting the promiſe, and agreeing to the terms, or condition of life impoſed on him. Now God having given this Law, and made this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, man by the violation of it became guilty, a debtor to the Juſtice of God, and ſo capable of a <hi>Redemption,</hi> a <hi>Remiſſion,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. I deſire you to conſider, <hi>That the Covenant of Grace, and promiſe by faith on Gods part, could not poſſibly have been made good, without the deſtruction of the firſt Covenant of Works, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of life made upon that:</hi> this is that which the Apoſtle ſaith in my text, <hi>That the promiſe by faith of Jeſus might be given to them that believe.</hi> I pray obſerve, here are three things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, 1. <hi>The matter of the promiſe.</hi> 2. <hi>The means by which the promiſe is to be obtained.</hi> 3. <hi>The objects of it.</hi> The promiſe intended, is doubtleſs the promiſe of eternal life; ſo often called in Scripture, (as being indeed the great and moſt valuable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe), what is the means of obtaining it? On Gods part it muſt be given out, on mans part it muſt be <hi>received by faith,</hi> for it is <hi>given to them that believe,</hi> and it is therefore called the promiſe by <hi>faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now the <hi>promiſe of life by works,</hi> under the firſt Covenant, was wholly inconſiſtent with this promiſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved by <hi>faith in Chriſt.</hi> Though the firſt Covenant compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended a faith in God, as being a piece of that internal homage, which every ſoul oweth to God; yet it could not comprehend a faith in Chriſt as our Mediator, there being no need of a Saviour, till we were in danger, nor of a Mediator, till we were become tranſgreſſors: How therefore was it poſſible that the promiſe of faith in Chriſt to thoſe who believe in him ſhould be given out, till firſt the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> was both given out, and alſo violated? Though the law by the promiſe of ſaith in Chriſt, was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:192227:248" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſo far forth, as it was a directive and obligatory rule of life and converſation unto all; yet ſo far as it was a <hi>Covenant of life,</hi> it muſt be both given out, and alſo deſtroyed, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of faith might be given out.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In the laſt place, I deſire you to conſider, <hi>That as on Gods part, the promiſe of life by faith in Chriſt, was inconſiſtent with the promiſe of life, upon the doing of the works of the law:</hi> ſo on our part, <hi>we ſhould never have come to Chriſt that we might have life, if we had not firſt been concluded under wrath:</hi> And this will appear to every intelligent ſoul, that will but conſider, <hi>That the going out of the ſoul unto Chriſt for life, is a diſclaimer of its own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> and a very great piece of <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> to which the ſoul will never move naturally, but muſt ſee it ſelf conſtrained to it by neceſſity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.10. <hi>Thou haſt found the life of thy hand, therefore thou wert not grieved:</hi> ſo long as a man ſeeth help in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and thinks that he hath found life in his own hands, ſo long he is not grieved, not at all concerned as to his eternal ſtate: And this is the true reaſon why you ſee the greateſt brokenneſs of heart, and ſenſe of ſin, yea and the greateſt holineſs of life too in thoſe men that yet look to be ſaved by faith in Jeſus Chriſt; for our <hi>free-will</hi> men that maintain a power in man to believe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or to keep the Law of God perfectly; they have ſaid, they have found life in their own hands, and then I hope they have none but themſelves to blame, if they miſs, and come ſhort of it; if they do not repent, and turn unto God to day, they can do it to morrow. It was neceſſary as on Gods part, in order to his giving out of the promiſe of faith in Chriſt, and exhibition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace to the world: ſo alſo on our part, in order to our acceptation, and taking hold of any ſuch Covenant, and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our ſouls unto God, upon the terms of that Covenant, for the ſure mercies of it; that there ſhould firſt be a Covenant of Works made with man, and a law of works given unto him; for had there been no ſuch Covenant made, no ſuch Law given, man could not have broken, and violated it; and if he had not violated, and broken it, he could not have been a tranſgreſſor, he could not have been a loſt ſinner, and conſequentially had needed no Saviour; nor would man have ever been perſwaded to have gone out of himſelf, and to have accepted of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt for his righteouſneſs, had he not firſt been rendred in a forlorn, deſperate, and hopeleſs condition, without Application unto Chriſt.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For the practical Application of what you have heard now in this diſcourſe. <hi>This,</hi> in the firſt place, <hi>ſhould mind us, not to be haſty to deny, nor too forward to ſtumble at ſome things in the diſpenſations of God, which at firſt ſeem to us hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</hi> Who can find out God, or ſearch out the Almighty unto perfection? I do not know any thing that looketh more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently in appearance to us, at our firſt view of it, than this; That God ſhould from eternity ſix the ſalvation of man upon a Covenant of Grace, and write it in his book, <hi>That there ſhould be ſalvation in no other, than in Jeſus Chriſt, nor any other name given under heaven amongſt men, whereby they might be ſaved: that he who believeth ſhould be ſaved, and he who believed not ſhould be damned,</hi> for all theſe things were decrees in the rolls of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or they could never have been <hi>Revelations of Gods Will in Scripture,</hi> Heb. 10.5, 6, 7. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. <hi>In the volume of Gods book it was written of Chriſt, that he ſhould come into the world, and do the Will of God, relating to the ſalvation of man:</hi> I ſay, that God ſhould thus ſetle mans ſalvation in the order of its cauſes, and upon the terms of free-grace, the merit and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt and Faith in him; and yet when mankind was created, God ſhould treat him upon a Law of Works, and make a Covenant with him for life and ſalvation, upon condition of his perfect obedience both to the Law written at that time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart, and this poſitive precept <hi>of not eating of the tree of forbidden fruit;</hi> yet there is nothing clearer in Scripture, than that God did do this: for to ſay that theſe were ſecond thoughts about mans ſalvation, when he was lapſed and fallen, were to blaſpheme by attributing change of mind and purpoſe to God, and a ſucceſſive knowledg of things, ſuch as we have upon the events, ſo aſcribing humane imperfections to a moſt holy God. If God from all eternity did ſettle the buſineſs of mans ſalvation (as the Apoſtle ſaith he did), <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us in him before the foundation of the world</hi> (that is, in Chriſt, as <hi>ver.</hi> 3.) <hi>that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love, having predeſtinated us unto the adoption of children, by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved, in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins according to the riches of his grace:</hi> and this, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>was the myſtery of his will according to his
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:192227:249" rendition="simple:additions"/>good pleaſure which he had purpoſed in himſelf;</hi> ſure we are, he created man in a ſtate, that was not capable of theſe ſpiritual bleſſings, until he was fallen from it, and that God according to that holy and guiltleſs ſtate, wherein he made man, did firſt ſtipulate with him in a Covenant of Works, and offered him life upon his doing the Law of God. I would gladly know of thoſe, who ſo flutter with their little ratiocinations, about the <hi>ſeriouſneſs of Gods actings in his offers of grace,</hi> and would make us believe that God doth not <hi>ſerio agere,</hi> act ſeriouſly in calling men to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>repent,</hi> unleſs there were a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſalvation for them all; or unleſs Chriſt intentionally dyed for all, or men had a power in their lapſed eſtate to do things ſpiritually good; I ſay, I would fain know of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God was in earneſt or no with <hi>Adam,</hi> when he promiſed him life upon the Covenant of Works. It is moſt certain, that he either never intended that <hi>Adam,</hi> or any of his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould go to Heaven that way, or that he was fruſtrated of his intention (which God cannot be). If he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that any ſhould be that way ſaved, I would know of them whether God was ſerious or no with <hi>Adam</hi> in ſuch a propoſal of life unto him; if they can find out an anſwer in this caſe, it will alſo ſerve in the other. God was ſerious with <hi>Adam</hi> in the making of the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> with him, ſerious with reſpect unto his own end, which was not that any ſhould be ſaved by the fulfilling of that Covenant, which he knew none would, but that it ſhould be as a <hi>School-maſter to lead us to Chriſt</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Law contained in Ordinances) and introductive to the exhibition of that better Covenant which God had eſtabliſhed with the Son of his Love, and upon which he had fixed the ſalvation of the Elect.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. We may learn from hence, <hi>That it is conſiſtent enough with the holineſs of God, to require things of perſons, which it is not his Will of purpoſe that they ſhould do;</hi> and to make conditional promiſes to them, who he knoweth will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fulfil the condition. Theſe are two things which ſome make a great pudder with, that they might eſtabliſh their <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalities,</hi> and obtain againſt the <hi>Election of Grace.</hi> They think that if God had determined the certain number of thoſe who ſhould be ſaved, or for whom Chriſt dyed; others ſhould
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:192227:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>not be called to, or required to believe, or repent, nor a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of life and ſalvation, and life made to them in caſe of their repenting and believing; for they apprehend it inconſiſtent with the truth and holineſs of God, to require that of men, which it is not his will or purpoſe they ſhould do, or to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> upon a condition, from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which they are precluded by the purpoſe of God. We muſt adhere to this, that there is nothing contingent to God, no event which he did not from eternity foreknow, and therefore foreknow, becauſe he willed either to effect, or to permit it. We can neither allow of any ignorance to be imputed unto God, nor any ſucceſſion in his knowledg, nor apprehend it poſſible that God ſhould from all eternity know who would believe and repent (which none could without his ſpecial grace) without willing that grace to them, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which they ſhould put forth theſe ſaving acts; and therefore ſuch to whom he did not by his eternal purpoſe will thoſe habits of grace, muſt be paſſed over. But then ſay they, who have other apprehenſions; How is it conſiſtent with the truth and holineſs of God to call all men to believe, and to repent, and to promiſe them eternal life and ſalvation, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the terms of faith and repentance? We ask them how <hi>it was conſiſtent with the truth and holineſs of God,</hi> to require of <hi>Adam</hi> under the Covenant of Works, <hi>not to eat of the tree of forbidden fruit, and to promiſe him life upon his not eating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</hi> when-as it is plain, that God had purpoſed <hi>to permit him to eat thereof, and foreknew that he would eat thereof,</hi> and never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>Adam,</hi> or any of his poſterity ſhould come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by the fulfilling of that Covenant. But then ſay they, to what purpoſe are theſe Precepts, or Promiſes? Divers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers are given by Divines, as to that queſtion concerning thoſe who are called to <hi>repent,</hi> and to <hi>believe,</hi> which poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly will hereafter fall in my way to touch upon. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as to this purpoſe it is enough to ſay, <hi>Gods end in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Covenant of Works with</hi> Adam, <hi>was to make way for the publication of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> For the exhibition and publication of which to the world, there was no room, until the Law and Covenant of Works was violated, and man that was created in the Image of God, and ſtate of Holineſs, had fallen from that ſtate, and become concluded under wrath.
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:192227:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>In the mean time obſerve, here is a <hi>precept given,</hi> which God had never intended, ſhould be obeyed; a conditional promiſe made, from which God never intended that any man ſhould have any advantage: and in that appeareth the advantage of this inſtance, for in the calls of the Goſpel to faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though the Lord hath told us, <hi>Many are called, and few are choſen;</hi> Although all to whom the Goſpel is Preached, be not the choſen of God, and within his purpoſe of eternal life and ſalvation: yet ſome are, and ſome ſay, <hi>Non proprie &amp; per ſe reprobos hortatos eſſe ad fidem &amp; poenitentiam, ſed per concomitantiam, quatenus electis externa ſocietato permiſcentur;</hi> That is, that reprobates are only called to faith and repentance, as they are mixed together with the elect. But here <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all mankind were called to a fulfilling of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> was upon that condition promiſed to them all, when-as yet it was never Gods purpoſe and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that any of them ſhould fulfil it, or that way obtain ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. In the laſt place my diſcourſe upon this argument <hi>may let you ſee, how uniformly the Providence of God in the converſion, and bringing home to God, of a particular ſinner, moveth to its motions and workings, in order to the general publication of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> and the way of ſalvation through him unto the world. The way of God in making known of Jeſus Chriſt to a particular ſoul, is ordinarily firſt by the <hi>law to humble the ſoul, and to conclude it under wrath,</hi> and then to open to it a door of hope: and indeed this is but a reaſonable working of Providence, and exceedingly ſuitable to the principles of reaſon, and humane nature. What ſignifies the news of a Redeemer unto him, who either is no captive, or is not ſenſible that he is; the news of a Saviour to him, that apprehendeth not himſelf loſt, or to ſtand in need of any ſalvation? God therefore ordinarily in the converſion of a ſinner, layeth the Law to him, ſheweth him what God hath required of him, how much he is a debtor to God, how much he lyes open to wrath, and is ſubject to the curſe: this letteth him ſee what need he hath of ſalvation by a Redeemer, and induceth him to be willing to go unto Chriſt for life. Now this motion and working of Providence, as to particular ſouls bears a juſt proportion to Gods firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Chriſt unto the world. God firſt gave unto <hi>Adam</hi>
                     <pb n="462" facs="tcp:192227:251"/>a Law of Works, and made a Covenant with him, and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to violate this Law, to break this Covenant, and then diſcovers the <hi>Covenant of Grace and Redemption,</hi> which to this time lay hidden with God, although as to the paction of it, it was eternal. And hence alſo appears an eaſie anſwer to that queſtion, whether men and women unregenerated, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> or <hi>under the Covenant of Grace;</hi> that all men ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> are not under the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> but under the diſpenſation of <hi>the Covenant of Grace</hi> is out of doubt, for the Covenant of Works expired with <hi>Adams</hi> fall. But thus far they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant of Works, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no ſalvation for them, but by keeping the whole Law in thought, word, and deed, which is a ſtate ſad and miſerable enough, it being that which no man in his lapſed eſtate is able to do. <hi>Adam</hi> indeed might have done it, none ſince the fall can do it; and from hence followeth the impoſſibility of ſalvation for any ſoul, that is out of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The law they cannot keep, ſo as from the fulfilling of that to expect ſalvation; and whereas (as the Apoſtle telleth us) <hi>what the law could not do, becauſe it was made weak through our fleſh, that God himſelf hath done, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſon in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and condemning ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us;</hi> they have no part nor portion in this matter, no ſtate nor intereſt in Chriſt, but are without Chriſt, and conſequently during their preſent ſtate incapable of any lively hope. But this is enough to have ſpoken to this firſt difficulty, and the inferences by way of Application to be made from it.</p>

                  <p>I Am endeavouring to expound to you ſome of the hard Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters of Divine Providence; Theſe times juſtifying that to be true of the book of Providence, which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of St. <hi>Pauls Epiſtles,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.16. <hi>There are in it ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable, wreſt unto their own deſtruction.</hi> It is truly ſaid of <hi>Tertullian, Deus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium conditor, nihil non ratione providet, diſpoſuit &amp; ordinavit, nihil non tractari intelligique voluit;</hi> that God the maker of all things, hath rationally diſpoſed and ordered all things, and would have us to underſtand all his works. It is moſt certain, that all the Lords ways are equal; and it is a noble employ to ſtudy the equality and reaſonableneſs of them: it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we ſhall wade beyond our ſtature, and be forced to cry out <hi>O the depth;</hi> but I think that grave Ancient ſaid true, that told us, <hi>That the Counſels of God do ſo exceed our capacity, that in ſome particulars they yet wonderfully accommodate themſelves to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals:</hi> and men might underſtand more of the reaſonableneſs of the motions of Divine Providence, if they would bring to their obſervation not ſo much <hi>diſcutiendi acumen,</hi> as <hi>diſcendi pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etatem,</hi> acuteneſs of wit to quarrel, as an humble deſire to learn of God, and to underſtand his will.

                     </gap> of difficulty as ariſe to conſiderate ſouls, from the conſideration of the motions of Providence, <hi>relating both to the Covenant of works, and that of Grace.</hi> I ſpake to one in my laſt exerciſe. I now proceed to a ſecond, which I ſhall ſtate thus.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Suppoſing the Covenant of Redemption and Grace made betwixt the eternal Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, not to have been general for all men: nor incertain for perſons that ſhould be ſo, and ſo qualified: and that the blood of this Covenant was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally ſhed, in proportion to the nature of the Covenant: How it could conſiſt with the truth of God to offer ſalvation to all in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of his word upon the Goſpel-terms of faith and repentance; or to what end it ſhould be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are two or three things here ſuppoſed, which by a great many will not be granted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We ſuppoſe here (firſt) <hi>A Covenant made from eternity betwixt God the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt relating to the ſalvation of the children of men.</hi> This, I know, ſome will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, but the Scripture ſpeaketh plainly. Now to <hi>Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made,</hi> he ſaith not <hi>to ſeeds as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but as of one, and to thy ſeed which was Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.16. Iſa. 42.6.—<hi>and I will give thee for a Covenant to the people;</hi> hence Chriſt was called <hi>a ſurety of a better Covenant;</hi> he was both the <hi>party Covenanting,</hi> and the <hi>ſurety of the Covenant.</hi> God the Father taking the word of his Son, for the fulfilling of the matter of the Covenant, both what was to be done by himſelf, upon which account it was called a <hi>Covenant of Redemption;</hi> and by us, with reſpect to which it is called the <hi>Covenant of Grace:</hi> God in and by it relaxing the rigour of the Law, which required perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, from the perſons offending, and a perfect performance of the whole Law; and accepted the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction given to Divine Juſtice, by the nature offending, hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically united to the perſon that was the Son of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting from us ſincerity, inſtead of perfect obedience; the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely willing mind, inſtead of the perfect deed: Such a Covenant we ſuppoſe and believe to have been made.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We believe <hi>it not made for all,</hi> but conformably to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Election;</hi> if it had been made for all, we could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand but that all men muſt be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="465" facs="tcp:192227:252"/>3. Nor can we think it was made for an <hi>uncertain number;</hi> but as there are individual names written in the Book of Life, ſo we believe the ſame concerning the rolls <hi>of this Covenant.</hi> The Lord (as the Apoſtle tells us) <hi>knoweth who are his.</hi> Chriſt was not <hi>Sponſor incerti foederis,</hi> a ſurety of an incertain, but of a certain Covenant. Some would make Chriſts Covenant with his Father, not to have been for theſe, or thoſe perſons, but indefinitely for thoſe that <hi>ſhould believe,</hi> and ſo to have been conditional. But certainly no conſiderate Chriſtian can allow this, who obſerveth that amongſt men, nothing but <hi>ignorance of future contingencies,</hi> is the cauſe of incertain, and conditional bargains: the Parent that dieth and gives his Child a Portion conditionally, that he or ſhe marrieth ſo and ſo, or be ſubject to ſuch or ſuch Governors, would have left out that condition, if he or ſhe had certainly known what the Child would have done; and it ſeems to us ſtrangely to derogate from the eternal perfection of the Divine Being, in point of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> ſo much as to fancy, that <hi>God the Father and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (who both from eternity knew who would, or would not repent and believe, and needs muſt know it, becauſe they could do neither but by vertue of ſpecial grace infuſed by, and derived from God,) ſhould make a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> each with other; that ſuch or ſuch perſons (who they knew would not repent nor believe,) if they believed and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould have a ſhare in the ſatisfaction and death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We do ſuppoſe and believe <hi>the blood of the Covenant</hi> (that is, the blood of Jeſus Chriſt) was <hi>intentionally poured forth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant,</hi> and for the perſons concerned in it. The blood of Chriſt is called the <hi>blood of the Covenant, Zech.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. and the <hi>Antitype</hi> to thoſe ancient types of the blood of Beaſts, which was ſo called, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.8. So that we think it a very unreaſonable aſſertion, to extend <hi>the blood of the Covenant,</hi> beyond the perſons concerned in the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>But yet notwithſtanding all this, there is nothing more evident in the iſſues of Divine Providence, than that this Covenant is held out to all indefinitely. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. Chriſts commiſſion to his Apoſtles runs thus, <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature: He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Here both the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the New Covenant, eternal life, and ſalvation is offered to all; and the terms, believing, and being baptized are alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:192227:253"/>unto all; and according to that direction, and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is all our Preaching. Now hence ariſeth the difficulty: If there be not a poſſibility of ſalvation for all men, if they all be not within the verge of the Covenant: If Chriſt hath not died for all, why is the Goſpel preached to every creature? how can it conſiſt <hi>with the truth and honour of that God who cannot lie,</hi> by his Miniſters to tell men, that if they will but <hi>repent, and believe, they ſhall be ſaved?</hi> To what end is the Goſpel preached unto them? To which I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Goſpel only aſſerteth <hi>the infallible connexion of faith and ſalvation.</hi> What ſaith the Goſpel? <hi>He that believeth, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and will any ſay that a believer ſhall be damned, or did ever any penitent and believing ſoul periſh? if there had, then indeed we might have quarrelled at the truth of God: but God will be true, though all men be found liars. What though ten thouſand be told, and have it rung in their Ears, <hi>That he who believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> and but ten of thoſe ten thouſand ſhould believe, provided that they be ſaved, God I hope is true, and what he hath ſaid, is to a tittle made good. But you will ſay, why then are all told, if they believe they ſhall be ſaved. The Miniſter of the Goſpel may go to every particular ſoul, and ſay to him or her, if thou repenteſt and believeſt thou ſhalt be ſaved. I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God is pleaſed <hi>to hide from his Miniſters, his ſecret counſels concerning the ſalvation of individual ſouls.</hi> They therefore may, and muſt ſay, <hi>whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and God will confirm in Heaven whatſoever they deliver on Earth: and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Commiſſion they may ſay to every individual ſoul, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> they know not who are <hi>ordained to life,</hi> and ſhall have effectual grace beſtowed upon them ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them to believe, but they know the general propoſition of the Goſpel is true. But ſtill you will ſay, why hath God by his Providence ſo ordered it, to what end ſhould the Providence of God order the <hi>publication and tender of the Covenant of Grace</hi> to a greater number than are concerned in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What if we ſhould ſay, <hi>It is (O Father) ſo becauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thee,</hi> and be forced here to cry out with the great Apoſtle, Rom. 9.33. <hi>O the depth of the ri hes, both of the wiſdom and know ledge of God; how unſearchable are his judgements, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi> verſ. 34. <hi>For who hath known the mind of the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:192227:253"/>Lord, or who hath been his Counſellor?</hi> Who is able to give a juſt account of Gods deſigns and intentions, to what purpoſe he doth things? It is enough for us to know that God doth them, and that God may do them, and there is no unrighteouſneſs with him if he doth do it. We ought to believe that God hath wiſe ends in what he doth, though we are not able to find out what they be. Yet it may not be amiſs to tell you what Divines do ſay in the caſe, though they cannot by <hi>ſearching find out God, nor find out the Almighty unto perfection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are thoſe that ſay, <hi>that Reprobates are only called to faith and repentance, as they are mixed with the elect,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations reach them only by way of concomitancy; and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it may be doubted, if there were any ſociety, or company of people in the world, amongſt whom there were not any ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to everlaſting life; whether God would at all ſend his Goſpel to them, or direct any of the Meſſengers of his word to go and call them to repentance. God incouraging <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 18.10. to preach the Goſpel undauntedly at <hi>Corinth,</hi> addeth this, <hi>for I have much people in this City.</hi> Now ſuppoſing a City in which God had no people, it might be much queſtioned whether God would. Certain it is that the Apoſtle telleth us, that God hath given <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers for the perfecting of the ſaints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4.11, 12. I remember that when the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> was ſent for to <hi>Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, Jehoram and the King of Edom,</hi> when they were in their diſtreſs for want of water, (you have the ſtory 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.13.) <hi>Eliſha ſaith to the King of Iſrael</hi> (who was a wicked King) <hi>what have I to do with thee?</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>Were it not that I regard the preſence of Jehoſophat, the King of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor ſee thee.</hi> I am very apt to think God ſpeaketh ſo to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one whom he hath paſſed over in his eternal purpoſe, and knoweth that they will not repent and believe; Were it not for the ſake of his <hi>elect,</hi> with whom theſe men are mixed, God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver regard them, nor look to them in his Goſpel diſpenſations: but as the <hi>Gardiner</hi> watereth the <hi>weeds</hi> amongſt the <hi>herbs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot at preſent well pluck them up; ſo God having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that the Tares ſhould be ſuffered amongſt the Wheat, till the great harveſt watereth them with the dew of the Goſpel; <hi>pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter adeunt, pariter audiunt</hi> (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith in another caſe) they living amongſt the elect of God, hear the words that are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:192227:254"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                     <pb n="468" facs="tcp:192227:255"/>from God to them; the Miniſters of the Goſpel they know them not, and therefore cannot diſtinguiſh; and it hath pleaſed the wiſe God ſo to order it. And this anſwer indeed almoſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the ſubject of the queſtion, for then it is as it were by accident only, that they are called to. The Elect are thoſe ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, others only as they are in their company; as a Father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending only to give good counſel to his own children, may yet give it to others, who accidentally are in their company.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But there are others who think, <hi>That God doth this, that he might declare to all what is their duty; Alii vocantur, ad of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium ſolum, alii etiam ad beneficium,</hi> Spanhemius. A Creditor may, I hope, mind his Debtor of his debt, though he knoweth that he is not able to pay a tenth part of it, and be reſolved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to lend him mony to do it; and ſo in calling upon him cannot be ſuppoſed ſo much as to intend his own payment, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; for none intendeth what he knoweth is impoſſible. This is an anſwer which our learned <hi>Pemble</hi> gives: but this anſwer doth not ſatisfie ſome other very learned men; for what is it to exhort another, but to declare his duty to him; and to ſay that the end why God declareth unto Reprobates their duty, is that he might declare their duty to them, is ſomething uncouth, for <hi>idem non eſt finis ſuiipſius:</hi> The queſtion is, what end the wiſe God can have in declaring their duty to them in, and by ſuch exhortations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is therefore poſſibly better anſwered, <hi>That God doth this for maintaining diſcipline, and government in the world.</hi> It is but a common obſervation, that the Preaching of the Goſpel gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reſtraineth, and civilizeth thoſe, or very many of thoſe whoſe hearts are not yet changed by it, and converted to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Goſpel. Take in your eye but two places, one where there is no Preaching of the Goſpel, or none which truly deſerveth that name; another place where the Goſpel is Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed duly, daily and lively; and obſerve if the generality of the people in the later place, be not ſtrangely more civilized than thoſe of the other Town or City. So that God by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel to all, and the work of his Providence in ſo ordering and diſpoſing it, though he doth not intend the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Reprobates; yet may have a wiſe and excellent end for the good of the world, in bridling and reſtraining the outragious, and unbridled luſts of ſuch men; ſo that the world is not ſuch a heap of confuſion, ſuch a place of univerſal diſorder, as it would
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:192227:255"/>be, were it not for the influence of the indefinite, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Preaching of the Goſpel amongſt them; nor is this an end at all unworthy of a wiſe and holy God, as well with relation to his own glory, which is impeached by the exorbitancies of mens luſts, as with reference to the good of <hi>humane ſociety,</hi> for which (as I have all along ſhewed you in theſe Diſcourſes) our good God in the motions of his Providence ſheweth a great kindneſs, and this may be ſaid to be another end of Gods, which alſo he doth generally obtain.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid by ſome, That God cauſeth the Goſpel to be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto ſome, <hi>that they might be without excuſe.</hi> The Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>That the inviſible things of God, from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power, and God-head, ſo that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,</hi> Rom. 1.20. he ſpeaketh of the Heathens; and why may not we ſay of others, that the glorious Goſpel of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is Preached unto many, and the riches of Divine Grace diſplayed before them, <hi>ſo that they are without excuſe,</hi> while they continue in impenitency and unbelief: we may ſay of them as the Apoſtle ſaith of the Jews, <hi>Have they not heard,</hi> Rom. 10.18. <hi>did they not know? God hath ſtretcht forth his hand to a diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and gainſaying people.</hi> verſ. 21. I know <hi>Arminius</hi> doth object againſt this anſwer, telling us, this <hi>cannot be Gods end in ſending his Goſpel, for exhortations, to faith and repentance, do not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves render perſons without excuſe;</hi> but this is added to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them. But this reaſon alſo would prove that the faith and obedience of the elect is not intended by God, for their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience alſo is added to the exhortations. But enough is ſpoken upon this <hi>Argument,</hi> as to ſuch who have an ear open to receive an anſwer. Suppoſing that God hath choſen but ſome to eternal life, that Chriſt hath made a Covenant but for ſome, nor intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally dyed for more than his Father had choſen in him, and given to him: yet God might cauſe the Goſpel to be preached unto all the world, and have very wiſe ends in the doing of it. So as that the univerſality of the call to <hi>faith and repentance,</hi> is no argument either <hi>againſt the election of grace,</hi> or for an <hi>incertain Covenant,</hi> no nor yet for an <hi>univerſal redemption.</hi>

                  <p>And from hence alſo an eaſie ſolution may be made of another appearing difficulty. It is certain, according to the letter of my
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:192227:256"/>Text, <hi>That now God commandeth every man to repent.</hi> How can this be?</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Suppoſing that a man or woman hath of himſelf no power to believe, or to repent; how ſtandeth it with the ſincerity and truth of God to command them to repent or believe; or how will it ſtand with Divine Juſtice, to condemn them for not repenting, or believing?</hi> For this general command of men to repent, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is not only made uſe of to deſtroy the <hi>Doctrine of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and the <hi>certainty of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> but alſo to deſtroy <hi>ſpecial and effectual Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My buſineſs is not at preſent to eſtabliſh thoſe great truths which are abundantly ſpoken to by others; and I have elſewhere, and at other times ſpoken abundantly to them: but only to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Providence of God, upon the ſuppoſal of the truth of them, and to ſhew you that the Univerſality of the Miniſterial Goſpel-call maketh no argument againſt them. I ſay then, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing man in his lapſed ſtate to have no power to <hi>repent,</hi> yet it is conſiſtent enough with the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> of God, with his <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> or any other attribute of his perfection, to call <hi>all men to repent;</hi> neither doth ſuch his call of them imply any ſuch <hi>natural, innate</hi> power in them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What if man in his lapſed eſtate by nature hath no power to any action that is ſpiritually good, not to <hi>believe, nor repent; yet is it not his duty to do both, and had not our proparent a power given him of God to do whatſoever was neceſſary in order to his eternal ſalvation?</hi> His duty is, becauſe God commandeth it; my Text ſaith, <hi>he commandeth now all men to repent:</hi> and certainly in <hi>Adam</hi> both he, and all of us had a power to do whatſoever was the will of God as to his own, and our ſalvation, in that eſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God created him, and us in him. Hath God loſt his right to demand his due, becauſe man hath loſt his power to pay it? I know the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> generally deny this, and ſay (and they ſay true) that <hi>Adam</hi> had not a power to <hi>repent</hi> and believe <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (that is, a <hi>ſpecifick power):</hi> but neither were theſe neceſſary in that ſtate, nor indeed practicable. <hi>Adam</hi> was <hi>created a juſt man, that needed no repentance,</hi> needed no <hi>faith in a Mediator;</hi> but <hi>Adam</hi> had a power, and we in him, <hi>to all in that eſtate neceſſary;</hi> if <hi>Adam</hi> and we (in him) have by volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tranſgreſſion, made any thing more neceſſary, and God upon
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:192227:256"/>a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> hath reſtored us upon the performance of ſuch other things; I hope Gods juſtice ſhall not be impeached, for his not giving us a power to do thoſe things alſo, whereas we originally had a ſufficiency of power to do all God required of us in that ſtate. <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſufficiently determines this point;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aq. ſum.</hi> §. 1. <hi>queſt.</hi> 95. <hi>art.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Adams reaſon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the ſtate of innocency being ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, and his inferiour faculties being ſubjected to his reaſon; he had in ſome ſenſe all graces</hi> [omnes virtutes] <hi>and that both in habit, and act, which do not imply an imperfection repugnant to that ſtate; others, only in the habit,</hi> &amp;c. He inſtanceth in <hi>repentance</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſaith, <hi>Adam</hi> had faith both in the <hi>habit</hi> and <hi>act;</hi> but he ſpeaks of <hi>faith</hi> only as reſpecting <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>propoſition of the word,</hi> not as reſpecting a <hi>Mediator,</hi> for the <hi>object;</hi> for we all know that in that ſtate there was no need of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>faith in the Mediator</hi> implieth the <hi>imperfection of a lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtate, repugnant to the perfection of the primaevous ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.</hi> It is enough we had in <hi>Adam</hi> a ſufficiency of power to do all neceſſary to our ſalvation in that eſtate. It was our tranſgreſſion made any thing elſe neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You heard under the former head, <hi>That God may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe ends why he now calleth all men to repent, though he did not intend that upon that call they ſhould repent or believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although lapſed man hath no power of himſelf, <hi>to repent, or believe,</hi> without the <hi>ſpecial effectual grace of God; yet he hath a power by vertue of that Common-Grace which God denieth to no man, to do much in order to his repentance and believing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. What if we ſhould leave it for a queſtion to be decided at the great day: whether <hi>Reprobates ſhall be condemned, ſtrictly for not believing, in ſenſu diviſo, that is, not receiving of Jeſus Chriſt, and reſting upon him as their Saviour; or for not believing, in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> not doing what in them lay, that <hi>they might believe.</hi> God calleth all men to <hi>repent</hi> and to <hi>believe;</hi> it is true, it is not in their power to exert an <hi>act of faith,</hi> or a <hi>ſalvifick</hi> act of repentance; but it is in their power to <hi>read the word,</hi> to <hi>hear it,</hi> to <hi>meditate</hi> upon it, <hi>to conſider their ſins, to leave many of them,</hi> as to the external act. I always thought it a very idle queſtion, <hi>An homine faciente quod in ſe eſt Deus teneatur gratiam dare,</hi> Whether if a man did what lay in his power to do, God be bound to give his effectual ſaving grace. For I dare ſay, an inſtance cannot be given of any that hath done what lies in his power, to
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:192227:257"/>whom God hath denied his effectual grace; but <hi>Deus tenetur,</hi> is a very hard ſaying. Who can make God a debtor to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? who hath given unto him, and it ſhall be repaid him? If we could not ſay any thing to juſtifie God in condemning ſinners (who have no power to any ſpiritual act) for not believing, not repenting; yet I think the matter would not be much, for in the great day we ſhall find God will have enough to ſay for condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners, for omitting what was in their power to do, or act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to it; though he ſhould ſay nothing to them, for not doing that which without his ſpecial grace is confeſſedly not in the power of lapſed man. But enough is ſpoken to vindicate this motion of Divine Providence. My Text is true, <hi>God now</hi> by his Miniſters <hi>calleth all men to repent,</hi> and he may do it with conſiſtency to his truth and ſincerity, to his holineſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, notwithſtanding the certainty of his election, and his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of who are his, having wrote their names in the book of life; and notwithſtanding the certainty of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> as to perſons, and the certainty of the perſons for whom Chriſt hath died, and the impotency in fallen man, to exert any truly ſpiritual act, ſuch as thoſe of faith, and repentance muſt be. Let us now conſider how this Diſcourſe may be uſeful to us by way of practical Application.</p>

And in the firſt place, this may be of uſe to you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain you from approving of the <hi>bold ſayings</hi> of thoſe who reflect upon the truths of God, and would turn them into <hi>falſhoods,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe forſooth, their narrow apprehenſions cannot reconcile them to the truth, ſincerity, holineſs and goodneſs of God. Let God be <hi>true</hi> and men liars; let him be good, infinitely good, though all men be bad, This quarrelling at God is an old humour of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hearts. <hi>O houſe of Iſrael</hi> (ſaith God Ezech. 18.25.) <hi>Is not my way equal, are not your ways unequal? When a righteous man turneth from his righteouſneſs, and committeth iniquities, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done ſhall he dye: again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedneſs, that he hath committed, and doth that which is right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive.</hi> When a ſinner repenteth, and believeth, he ſhall live, he ſhall be ſaved: when he apoſtatizeth from his profeſſion, and returneth with the Dog to his vomit, or goeth on impenitently in his courſe of ſin, and dieth in it, his ſoul ſhall periſh. What then, are not
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:192227:257"/>the Lords ways equal, is not God in all this holy, and righteous, and juſt, and good?</p>
                  <p>O but it is not equal, ſay ſome, that God ſhould offer life, and the benefits of the Covenant of Grace, to thoſe to whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not to give them. How doth it appear, that God offers any ſuch thing to them; why may not Gods offer be only to the elect, and others no further concerned, than as they are in the company of thoſe to whom ſuch grace is offered? But the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel who are Gods Meſſengers, do offer life to all that will believe: they do ſo, and God will make it good; where now is the inequality of Gods ways? But why is the Goſpel at all preached to thoſe who ſhall have no benefit by it? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, What if God pleaſe to make uſe of this as a means the better to reſtrain the luſts of men, and to keep the world in order, and a temper fit for mutual ſociety. But why are they commanded to repent and believe, that have no power to do either? Had they never a power in <hi>Adam?</hi> If they had, ſurely God may require his debt although they be not able to pay. Have they a power to do nothing toward theſe things? If they would do what in them lay, would God deny his grace? Did ever any ſoul periſh, think you, that did what was within its power in order to its ſalvation? If there did not, why do men quarrel with God? their deſtruction is of themſelves.</p>

What remaineth then, but that leaving our diſputing with God, or quarrelling either with the truths of his word, or motions of his Providence; <hi>all men apply themſelves to be obedient to the Heavenly Command?</hi> The days of ignorance God winked at; but <hi>now,</hi> ſaith my Text, <hi>God commandeth all men to repent.</hi> Suppoſing an election of grace, and that not of qualities, but of perſons. Suppoſing an eternal Covenant, and that certain, made betwixt the eternal Father, and the Son of his Love for thoſe that ſhall be ſaved. Suppoſing that Chriſt did not dye intentionally for all, but for ſuch only as were fore-ordained of God to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life and ſalvation. Suppoſing laſtly, that man in his lapſed eſtate, hath no power to repent or ſavingly to believe. Yet I ſhall ſhew you there is incouragement enough for any that will mind their eternal intereſt to do what in them lies, that they may repent and believe: to that end I beg of you to conſider theſe things.</p>

If God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth him to do ſomething which he cannot do by his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power; yet ſurely he is bound to do what he can do, and then to cry to God to help him where he is at a loſs.

                     <pb n="475" facs="tcp:192227:259"/>It was encouragement enough to theſe poor Lepers, that it was poſſible they might ſave their lives by that motion. <hi>Eſther</hi> did not know that the King would hold out the Golden-Scepter to her, if ſhe went in to the King; but ſhe knew that if ſhe did not go in, ſhe and her people would all be cut off, and that in a ſhort time: ſhe ventureth in. Thou knoweſt that if thou fitteſt ſtill in thy ſinful ſtate, thou ſhalt periſh; if thou goeſt on from ſin to ſin, thou ſhalt certainly periſh without hope of mercy. But thou haſt heard, that the number of them that God hath choſen unto life, for whom God hath made a Covenant with his Son, and his Son hath died, and ſatisfied Divine-juſtice, is a certain definite number, and thou doſt not know, that thou art one of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but thou doſt not know on the other ſide that thou art none of that number, thou maiſt be one for ought thou knoweſt; there is no law againſt thee: certainly this is ground and encouragement enough for thee to make the adventure: if God <hi>will ſave thee alive</hi> thou ſhalt live, and that eternally; if thou fitteſt ſtill, if thou goeſt on in thy ſinful courſes, thou ſhalt certainly dye.</p>

                     </gap>, the hard Chapters in the book of Divine Providence, ſolving thoſe <hi>Phaenomena's,</hi> or appearing difficulties, which Atheiſtical Wits have raiſed, to make the holy God appear otherwiſe than he is, his Counſels, Truths, and Works, other than indeed they are. I have already ſpoken to one, relating to the making and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> with <hi>Adam,</hi> after the ſettlement of mans ſalvation upon <hi>the Covenant of Grace.</hi> The other relating to the diſpenſation of Providence, in the exhibition and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Covenant of Grace. I come now to ſome rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Actual Providence of God in the permiſſion of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>ſinners,</hi> ſo much ſin, and ſo many ſinners in the world. And for this diſcourſe (as an head to it) I have choſen this text, which in it containeth two great points: <hi>The abounding of ſin, and the aboundings of grace.</hi> The Apoſtle brings in theſe words in a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of Chriſt, whom he had compared with the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> brought mankind under ſin and guilt. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond brought him under a ſtate of Redemption and Salvation, bringing life and immortality to light. Firſt, the Apoſtle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whence ſin came, then whence grace came. <hi>Paraeus</hi> telleth us, that the Apoſtle in this part of the Chapter, openeth to us the uſe of the Law, leſt any one upon what he had before ſaid ſhould ask; Wherefore the <hi>law was given:</hi> he telleth us, <hi>That the law entred, that ſin might abound;</hi> for though the law of it ſelf doth not cauſe ſin, yet by accident it doth; for where there is <hi>no law, there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> and the corruption of mans nature enclineth him the more to what is forbidden him—<hi>Nitimur
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:192227:261"/>in vetitum: ſed hic de actione peccati ſermo eſt quae fit per manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem</hi> (ſaith a learned Author upon my Text). The law maketh <hi>ſin to abound</hi> by way of manifeſtation, as the glaſs maketh the ſpots in a man or womans face to abound, that is, diſcovereth them that are. <hi>P. Martyr</hi> reckons five ways, by which the Law contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the aboundings of ſin. 1. <hi>By forbidding it.</hi> 2. <hi>By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the guilt of it.</hi> 3. <hi>By aſſigning the puniſhment of it.</hi> 4. <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying it by the variety of the precepts in it.</hi> 5. <hi>By accuſing him, and condemning him for it.</hi> Well, But why <hi>ſhould the law enter, that ſin might abound?</hi> hath God then any pleaſure or delight in the aboundings of ſin? The text telleth you, that Gods deſign was to advance grace; <hi>that where ſin abounded, grace might much more abound.</hi> But my deſign is not largely, and ſtrictly to handle my text, but only to make uſe of it, in purſuit of my further deſign to open to you the difficult things of Actual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which is by all confeſſed to have an influence upon mens ſins; that is, <hi>to permit them,</hi> and <hi>to govern them,</hi> the firſt of theſe is what I have here to do with. What the Providence of God doth, or doth not in the permiſſion of ſin, I have before ſhewed you, and may by and by again ſpeak ſhortly unto it. The Queſtion is,</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How it can conſiſt with the holineſs of a pure and mighty God, having it in his power to reſtrain, and hinder ſin, yet to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, and ſo much of it in the world?</hi> The difficulty of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions in this matter, ariſeth from theſe things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That God in his own nature is a moſt pure and holy being.</hi> Who as he hath nothing in him that defileth, ſo neither can he abide any iniquity. This ſeemeth to have ſtumbled the holy Prophet, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity: wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deal treacherouſly?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is nothing in the world ſo contrary unto God as ſin is,</hi> nothing ſo repugnant to his nature, nothing ſo prejudicial to his glory, nothing that he hateth with ſo perfect an hatred.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That it always was, and is in the power of God to hinder ſin;</hi> God could have hindred <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and all the ſin which hath ſince that been committed in the world. Now theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that yet God ſhould not hinder ſin, but <hi>ſuffer men to walk in their own ways,</hi> and to fulfil their unbridled luſts, ſeems at firſt view of difficult apprehenſion.</p>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:192227:261"/>
                  <p>It hath been ſo hard a Chapter to ſome, that they have fancied two Gods, the one to be the <hi>Principle</hi> of all the good, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the evil that is in the world; they were not able to conceive how a pure and holy God could permit ſin. The Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Providence</hi> about ſin, I have heretofore more largely diſcourſed. Amongſt others I have inſtanced in theſe two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He doth permit, and ſuffer it when he might hinder it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Providence doth co-operate <hi>as to the natural action, though not as to the malice and ſinfulneſs of the action.</hi> It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that in him every man <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>moves.</hi> The blaſphemer, the lyer, the profane curſer, and ſwearer could not ſpeak, if the Providence of God did not in the mean time uphold the natural faculties, whoſe operations are neceſſary to ſuch actions. Now this is that which ſometimes ſtartles our deliberate thoughts; if God indeed be ſo holy and pure a God, as we have heard he is? if he ſo hateth and abhorreth ſinful actions; and if he be ſo mighty and powerful a God, why doth not God withdraw that Providence of his, which upholdeth the ſinner to the natural action, while he ſeeth and knoweth which way the luſt in the ſinners heart will incline his action? I conceive now my text gives ſome relief to our diſquieted thoughts about this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Why did God firſt <hi>ſuffer the law to enter?</hi> That ſin might abound, <hi>that the offence might abound</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>v.</hi> 20. But why ſhould ſin abound? why did the Providence of God ſuffer ſin to abound? <hi>That grace might much more abound: For,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>where ſin abounded, grace did much more abound. That as ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo grace might reign through righteouſneſs unto eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle is here doubtleſs ſpeaking with a great reſpect to the firſt mans ſin, of which he had been ſpeaking in the former verſes. <hi>Death paſſed over all men, for that all have ſinned:</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Through the offence of one, many be dead:</hi> and ſo in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes you read of one mans ſin, one mans <hi>offence, one mans diſobedience,</hi> &amp;c. But yet he is not ſpeaking only of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, for he tells you, <hi>Many were made ſinners, and all have ſinned;</hi> and he is alſo ſpeaking of ſin as <hi>conſequent to the law given,</hi> which I do not think is to be underſtood of the law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Covenant made with him; but of the law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in that latitude I ſhall diſcourſe this ſubject, ſhewing you that God in a great deal of wiſdom, did firſt ſuffer ſin to enter into
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:192227:262"/>the world, and ſtill ſuffereth ſin to abound in the world. You may take that for the Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>Prop. <hi>The holy and omnipotent God in an infinite wiſdom of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſuffereth ſin and ſinners to abound in the world, though himſelf be of purer eyes than to behold iniquity:</hi> he hates, and abhorreth every ſin, nothing ſo grieveth and diſhonoureth him; yet I ſay, in infinite wiſdom his Providence doth permit it, ſuffering men to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the luſts of their own hearts, and to walk in their own ways. My buſineſs muſt be to give you ſome account of the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in it, and to make Gods ways of Providence in this thing to appear unto you equal. It is a true ſaying of one of the School-men, <hi>Plus eſt bonum, vel numero vel quantitate quod Deus elicit per mala, quam quod deſtruitur per mala,</hi> Al. Al. <hi>There is one way or other, either in number or in quantity, more good which God fetcheth out of ſin, than is deſtroyed by ſin.</hi> We may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of this, or God would never ſuffer it. And indeed the Doctrinal part of my diſcourſe, will be nothing elſe than a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of that <hi>maxim.</hi> I ſhall therefore this day entertain you with a reſolution of this riddle, much like that of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when he had killed the Lyon, and eaten of the honey the Bees had made in the carcaſe, <hi>Jud.</hi> 14.4. ſhewing you, how <hi>out of the eater cometh meat, and out of the ſtrong cometh ſweetneſs:</hi> How out of ſin, which is the vileſt thing in the world, the moſt oppoſite and repugnant thing to the glory of God, the glory of God is yet fetched, and that in a proportion to compenſate the loſs and prejudice to his glory from the ſin of the ſinner. It is certain which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> long ſince ſaid, and gave as a reaſon of Gods permiſſion of ſin; <hi>Deus judicavit melius de malis benefacere quam mala eſſe non permittere:</hi> God judged it better to bring good out of ſin, than not permit ſin to be committed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, let me ſhew you <hi>how many Attributes of God are glorified by his permiſſion of ſin and ſinners in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place it is I think well obſerved by an acute Author, <hi>That God in this motion of Providence magnifieth his equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to our humane nature.</hi> Equity indeed is but a piece of juſtice. (But when I come to ſpeak to that Attribute, I ſhall reſtrain my diſcourſe to Gods Punitive and Vindicative Juſtice). Our great maſter, who hath commanded us to give unto our ſervants that which is juſt and equal, will much more do it himſelf; and it
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:192227:262"/>is ſaid of God, <hi>He ſhall judg the people with equity,</hi> Pſal. 98.9. and he took it very ill, when his people ſaid, <hi>That his ways were not equal.</hi> The equity of God required that he ſhould leave humane nature to its liberty; man was created with a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoul, and the very nature of it had been deſtroyed, if it had been left under a coaction: and in this the condition of humane nature had been worſe than that of ſenſitive creatures, which freely uſe their natural faculties, and exerciſe their natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is a ſaying of <hi>Aquinas, That it is not the work of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in its government of man to deſtroy its nature, but to heal and ſave it.</hi> God in ſuffering men to walk in their own ways, doth but leave men to their natural liberty, and thus magnify the Equity of God to humane nature. But this is one of the leaſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God by the permiſſion of ſin and ſinners, and the aboundings of ſin in the world, hath <hi>infinitely magnified his own goodneſs.</hi> It is the ſaying of a very ingenious Author, <hi>Satis uſui ſunt ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera, ſi artem &amp; peritiam divinae beneficentiae provocant;</hi> Sin is of uſe enough to God in the buſineſs of his glory, if by it the act and skill of the Divine Goodneſs and Bounty be made appear to the world; the goodneſs and mercy of God is that Attribute of his, which above all others he hath made choice of to glorify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in and by: it is that in which he delighteth, which is above all his works. Now without the permiſſion of ſin, yea of the aboundings of ſin, it had been impoſſible that Divine Goodneſs and Bounty ſhould have been ſo commended to the world. Let me open this a little.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſts coming, and dying for ſinners,</hi> was the greateſt act of love that was ever ſhewed to the children of men. What <hi>greater love</hi> could the eternal Father ſhew, than to give his Son out of his own boſom, to be a ſacrifice for ſins: <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi> ſaith <hi>John,</hi> 3 Chap. 16. <hi>that he gave his only begotten ſon.</hi> Moraliſts make a queſtion about taking the true meaſures of the <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus</hi> of love, whether the greatneſs of love be to be meaſured from the <hi>affliction, intention,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denial,</hi> of the party loving, or the benefit redounding to the perſon beloved; but meaſure which way you will, it was the greateſt love on the Fathers ſide, and the greateſt that <hi>Chriſt could ſhew, for greater love than this hath no man ſhewed,</hi> John 15. and herein God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his love towards us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. Beſides, the inhabitation
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:192227:263"/>of the ſpirit was a benefit of Chriſts death, an effect of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. And what greater love could be ſhewed on the part of the Holy Spirit (which is the Spirit of Chriſt), than for it to come down, and to dwell in the heart of a poor creature; for the perſon of a believer, to be made the <hi>temple of the Holy Ghoſt, the receptacle of the Spirit of Grace.</hi> Now if there had been no ſin, no ſinners in the world; what room had there been for a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? what needed one to have <hi>turned away iniquity from Jacob,</hi> to have been <hi>wounded for our iniquities, bruiſed for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions? He dyed for our ſins,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. How could the love of the eternal Father in ſending his Son, or the love of the Son, in taking upon him our nature, and dying for us; or the love of the Holy Spirit, in ſanctifying us, and renewing us, and dwelling in us, been manifeſted to the world? If a <hi>ſtrong man</hi> had not kept the houſe, what need had there been of a <hi>ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he</hi> to have come and diſpoſſeſſed him? All the love of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> magnified in the buſineſs of mans Redemption, and the whole Oeconomy of a Goſpel-ſalvation, had been conceal'd, and not known to the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>How could the love of God, in the converſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in the pardon of their ſins, in their juſtification, the ſenſe they oft have of his love have been manifeſted to the world?</hi> What need were there of any pardon, if no ſins were permitted? where were the aboundings of grace in pardoning, if there were no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundings of ſin? What love of God could be ſeen in the converſion of ſinners, if no ſinners were permitted in the world? How ſhould God magnify his grace, by ſaying to any ſoul, <hi>Be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> if he did not ſuffer ſins to be committed? Thus you ſee the greatneſs of Divine Goodneſs and Mercy, could never have been declared to the world, but for the motions of Providence, in the permiſſion of ſins and ſinners, yea and of the aboundings of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Did not the Actual Providence of God thus permit ſin, and much ſin in the world; <hi>How ſhould the long-ſuffering and patience of God be magnified in the world?</hi> This alſo is a piece of Gods Name, and ſuch a one by which he deſigneth to make himſelf glorious: he ſtileth himſelf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>Gracious, merciful, long-ſuffering, ſlow to anger:</hi> and <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.18. <hi>The Lord is long-ſuffering, and full of tender compaſſion.</hi> Now ſin and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are the objects about which the long-ſufferance of God is
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:192227:263"/>exerciſed: <hi>He endured with much long-ſuffering</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22.) <hi>veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction.</hi> How often do we find this in our own experience? when we hear wretches blaſpheming God, and daring Divine Juſtice, how often are we ready to ſay (and it is a good reflexion), <hi>O what a patient God do we ſerve!</hi> which of us would endure ſuch affronts and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, as God endureth every day? The aboundings of ſin in the world make the conſiderate part of the inhabitants of it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and adore the long-ſuffering and patience of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The wiſdom of God is alſo wonderfully magnified by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin.</hi> The Apoſtle calleth God, <hi>the only wiſe God.</hi> None ſo wiſe as God is, and the <hi>wiſdom of God</hi> is eminently magnified by his permiſſion of ſin. One great buſineſs of wiſdom, is to make an Election of the beſt end; but this is not that which I am here ſpeaking to, God hath fixed his end, it is his own glory; and as I have often told you, he can aim at no other end than himſelf and his own glory. But next to a good Election of an end, <hi>wiſdom</hi> is eminently ſeen <hi>in the choice and conduct of means, in order to a propoſed end;</hi> but herein is the <hi>heighth of wiſdom,</hi> to be able to make uſe of the moſt unlikely means, and make them to ſerve our purpoſe. It is a point I have touched ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing largely upon in my former diſcourſes upon this Argument, and therefore I ſhall not here enlarge upon it. To bring a not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being into a being, to make a thing out of nothing, argueth an infinite power; though there be <hi>aliquid materiae,</hi> ſomething of a matter; yet if there be <hi>nihilum ſubjecti,</hi> no aptitude in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to produce an effect of that nature: as when God took the rib of a man, and made of it a woman; this argued alſo an <hi>omnipotent infinite power.</hi> But yet, methinks, for God to produce his glory out of the aboundings of ſin, argueth yet ſomething more, if not of power, yet of wiſdom; to make the <hi>wrath of men to praiſe him,</hi> and the lyes of men to glorify him. O how doth this commend the infinite wiſdom of an only wiſe God! Sin, all ſin is quite oppoſite and repugnant to the glory of God: it ſpeaks the great Wiſdom of God to bring out his glory from it. Thus God hath glory by accident from the permiſſion and ſufferance of ſin in the world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But let me further ſhew how God is further <hi>glorified by reaſon</hi> of the aboundings of ſin, in the <hi>manifeſtation of his Juſtice,</hi> his <hi>Punitive and Vindicative Juſtice,</hi> Rom. 9.22. <hi>What if God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

                        <pb n="484" facs="tcp:192227:265"/>to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-ſuffering, veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction:</hi> there is a great deal in that verſe. 1. The Apoſtle hinteth us in that text, that we are <hi>Clay,</hi> and God is our <hi>Potter;</hi> it was what God had ſaid of old by his Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. 18. verſ. 6. and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 45. verſ. 9. and what the Apoſtle himſelf had ſaid in the two verſes immediately preceding: upon this account it is, that he here calls ſuch as periſh, <hi>veſſels of wrath;</hi> Earthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels, with relation to the Potter before-mentioned. 2. Being ſuch <hi>Potters veſſels,</hi> God had undoubtedly a <hi>jus abſolutum,</hi> an abſolute right and dominion over the Sons of men, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. Hath not the Potter <hi>power over the Clay,</hi> of the ſame lump to make one a <hi>veſſel of honour,</hi> another a <hi>veſſel of diſhonour?</hi> 3. He ſheweth, that God doth deſtinate ſome to diſhonour, not <hi>uſing his abſolute right,</hi> and prerogative meerly, but for juſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous cauſes: and he inſtanceth in three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Gods will to ſhew his wrath.</hi> The wrath of God is nothing elſe but his <hi>juſt will</hi> to puniſh Violaters of his Law. God is willing to ſhew his hatred of ſin in the juſt puniſhment of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Gods will to make his power known;</hi> that is, in breaking the ſtubbornneſs of ſinners: thus <hi>ver.</hi> 17. it is ſaid of <hi>Pharaoh, For this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth:</hi> and this God calleth a <hi>getting himſelf glory upon Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 14.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third reaſon he gives, is, <hi>That they are fitted for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> Divines ſtart a queſtion from theſe words, How, or from whom, they are <hi>fitted for deſtruction?</hi> Some ſay of <hi>God,</hi> as their Potter, others will have it to be from <hi>Satan,</hi> others from themſelves; the different notions may be reconciled. <hi>Paraeus</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, there are three things to be conſidered in theſe veſſels of wrath, their <hi>nature,</hi> their <hi>ſin,</hi> the <hi>end:</hi> as to their nature, they are not from themſelves, nor from <hi>Satan,</hi> but from God, he is the Maker of all. As to their <hi>pravity</hi> and <hi>natural corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that is not from God, but from themſelves, and from the Devil; the end is either <hi>preximate,</hi> that is, their own diſhonour, and deſtruction, or remote, and ultimate, that is, the ſhewing forth the Juſtice and Power of God. Neither of theſe (ſaith that learned Author) is from themſelves, for they do not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain themſelves to deſtruction, nor deſign the manifeſtation of
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:192227:265"/>the Lords Power and Juſtice. Thus therefore (ſaith he) are the veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction, according to nature, they are created, and made by no other than by God: as to their <hi>ſin and corruption,</hi> by which they are made <hi>children of wrath,</hi> guilty of ſin, and ſubject unto wrath; they are made ſo by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> by their own <hi>ſpontaneous fall,</hi> and that ſin which followed it: as to the ends, they are from God, and according to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counſel of predeſtination. And this is the reaſon, as is not only obſerved by <hi>Paraeus,</hi> but by <hi>P. Martyr</hi> probably, why the Apoſtle only ſaith <hi>fitted,</hi> and not by whom fitted for deſtruction: that <hi>fittedneſs</hi> referring partly to <hi>God,</hi> partly to themſelves (as they are by ſin fitted, it is their own act). Now when he ſpeaks of the <hi>veſſels</hi> of mercy, he ſpeaks in the active voice <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, v. 23. <hi>Which he had before prepared unto glory.</hi> So that it being the work of the ſinner to fit himſelf for deſtruction by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyings and aboundings of ſin, and God glorifying his Juſtice and Power in breaking and deſtroying ſinners, it is eaſie to underſtand how Gods ſuffering the aboundings of ſin, tendeth to the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Power, and Vindicative Juſtice. And thus I have ſhewed how the various Attributes of God are glorified by his permiſſion of ſin. But this is but one way by which God hath glory from the permiſſion of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath glory from it, <hi>from thoſe exerciſes of grace which are occaſioned by it, from his own people;</hi> and theſe are more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> or more <hi>external;</hi> for ſuch as are more <hi>internal, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith, humility,</hi> ſeveral other graces have either their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal motions from this Providence, or are greatly advantaged in their exerciſe by it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For <hi>repentance,</hi> that is conſiderable either in the <hi>inward affection,</hi> or <hi>more external act.</hi> As to the former, if no ſin were permitted, how could there be any <hi>humiliation</hi> for ſin, any <hi>godly ſhame,</hi> or <hi>ſorrow,</hi> any <hi>bleeding</hi> or <hi>brokenneſs of heart</hi> in the <hi>ſenſe of ſin?</hi> Were no ſin permitted, there could be no repentance, no godly ſorrow for ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God hath a great deal of glory, by mens <hi>believing on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is a great piece of the Will of God, that men ſhould believe on him whom God hath ſent, and God is glorified by our doing his Will. It were a large Theme to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to you how variouſly God is glorified by mens receiving of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and believing in him.</hi> But God had had
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:192227:266"/>none of this glory if there had been no permiſſion of ſin in the world: what is it to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but to accept of him as our Saviour, to expect Salvation from free grace, through the merits of Chriſt, and to depend upon him for it? Now ſhould God permit no ſin there would be no need of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, no occaſion for a redeemer, no need of going out of our ſelves, relinquiſhing all confidences in the fleſh, and in our ſelves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt as our redeemer and Saviour ſuppoſeth ſin ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us loſt undone Creatures to ſtand in need of ſuch a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, <hi>Humility</hi> is another habit of grace, in the exerciſe of which God is glorified: it is one of thoſe things which God by his Prophet telleth us that he requires of man, to <hi>walk humbly with his God;</hi> nothing more contributes to this, than a Child of Gods continual walking in a view of his own paſt, and renewing Sins. Thus far even the beſt of Gods people are beholden to their ſins, they make them walk more ſoftly, and to have more humble and mean opinions of themſelves, and to be more low in their own eyes, neither exalting themſelves againſt God, nor cenſoriouſly, and raſhly judging their brethren, and the more or leſs that any Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian looks at home, and conſidereth himſelf, and his own ways, the more or leſs he walks humbly towards God, and charitably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his brethren.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Finally in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. You ſhall find a whole quire of graces, all ſinging forth the praiſes of God, and all occaſioned by ſin. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> had offended in the buſineſs of the inceſtuous perſon, the Apoſtle in his former Epiſtle had brought them to a ſenſe of their ſin, and to a godly ſorrow for it. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this ſelf-ſame thing, that you ſorrowed after a godly ſort, what care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs it wrought in you? Yea what clearing of your ſelves? Yea what indignation, what fear, what vehement deſire, yea what zeal, what revenge:</hi> theſe now are all exerciſes of grace, which bring glory to God; if God ſhould not ſometimes ſuffer his own people to fall, all the revenue of his glory from theſe exerciſes would be loſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Again, hath God any glory from any more external Acts of <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Homage, which we perform unto him;</hi> from our <hi>Prayers, Praiſes,</hi> from our <hi>hearing</hi> his <hi>word, receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> Prayer is made up of <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> for pardon of <hi>Sin,</hi> and ſtrength againſt <hi>Sin. Confeſſion</hi> of Sin
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:192227:266"/>gives glory to God, my Son (ſaith <hi>Joſhuah</hi> to <hi>Achan</hi>) confeſs and <hi>give glory to God.</hi> Supplication for good things gives God glory as it owns him to be the Fountain of all good, and our whole dependance to be upon him. It is true, had Sin never entred into the World, our daily dependence upon God, would have evinced Prayer to have been our daily, and a natural homage, which derived, inferiour beings do owe unto the firſt being. But there would have been no need of Prayer, either for the pardon of Sin, or for ſtrength againſt Sin. For <hi>Praiſe,</hi> that alſo is a piece of Homage, which <hi>Adam</hi> would have owed unto God if he had ſtood in his firſt integrity, and ſtate of Innocency; and the <hi>Angels</hi> of God who never fell are continually occupied in ſinging the praiſes of God. But the praiſes of God both by his Saints upon the Earth, and by his glorified Saints, are highly advantaged, by the forgiveneſs of their Sins, and their having their garments waſhed in the blood of the Lamb. Now if no ſin were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the World, none would be remitted and forgiven, and all the glory which the God of Heaven hath from his Saints on Earth, or in Heaven for the free forgiveneſs of their Sins, would have been loſt. Certainly the fall of the evil Angels advantages the praiſes of the elect Angel, it being doubtleſs a piece of their ſong to bleſs God, who ſuffered not them to fall as the infernal Spirits did: and indeed this needeth no further evidence than what it hath from every gracious Soul, that hath taſted any thing of the love of God in pardoning mercies. I appeal to any ſuch Soul, to what a pitch it raiſeth his Soul in the thoughts of God, and the admirings of his Divine love and grace. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1, 2, 3. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and all that is within me bleſs his holy name: Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgiveth all thine iniquities, and healeth all thy diſeaſes.</hi> Thus I have ſhewed you a ſecond way by which God gets himſelf glory from Sin, the permiſſion of Sin in the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> are <hi>advantaged by Sin,</hi> Sin is a foil to holineſs. <hi>Pulchriora apparent bona ex malorum deformitate.</hi> As the dark ſhadows are advantages to the Picture, and the wanton thinks at leaſt that her black Patches are advantages to her beauty; ſo are the Sins and Debaucheries which God permitteth in the world advantages to holineſs. The beautiful and well-propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned works of Nature are the more beautiful for the Monſters, that it erreth in. Sin is but <hi>(monſtrum morum)</hi> a monſter in mens

I am perſwaded that in the very times wherein we live God hath made uſe of the prodigious intemperance, luſt and luxury, Atheiſme and fooliſh ſuperſtitious vanities of ſome, to make true Religion, Godlineſs, and Vertue, appear more lovely unto thouſands than before they did.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, From what is ſaid abundantly appears, that it is not without infinite wiſdom that the Lord though he be pleaſed to manifeſt the riches of grace upon ſome, to change their hearts, and to turn them from the wickedneſs of their ways, plucking them as brands out of the fire; yet ſuffers multitudes to <hi>walk in their own ways, till they drop into that Pit from which there is no Redemption for ever.</hi> We may all of us be aſſured, that the wiſe God conſulteth his own glory in this. In the ſame Text, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.4. Where he tells us <hi>that he hath made the wicked for the day of evil,</hi> he ſaith in the former part, <hi>that he hath made all things for himſelf.</hi> Though we be not able to ſee the particular reaſon of many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God, yet we ought to preſume they are not done without excellent Counſel, admirable reaſon, incomprehenſible wiſdom; yea and infinite love toward thoſe that ſhall be ſaved. I ſhall cloſe this diſcourſe with an excellent ſaying of one of the Ancients. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an ignorant perſon goeth into a Smiths ſhop, what matters it if he doth not knowof what particular uſe the Sleth, the Anvil and other utenſils are, yet it is enough if the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knoweth and can make uſe of every utenſil in it's ſeaſon:</hi> what if we do not know, if we cannot comprehend, of what uſe ſome particular ſinful actions of men ſhould be for the glory of God; it is enough for us that God knoweth, the vileſt action that was ever done in the World, the crucifying of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was of the greateſt uſe for the manifeſtation of the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>Now after this diſcourſe of the reaſonableneſs of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in permitting Sin, for the further manifeſtation of the glory of God, and the acquiſition of glory to his ſacred name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may ſeem an idle queſtion, <hi>why the Lord ſuffereth ſo many ſinners,</hi> ſo as his own number is but a little flock in compariſon of thoſe Herds; for ſin being a <hi>quality</hi> muſt inhere in ſome Subject, and if there were no ſinners tolerated there could be no ſin: but yet let me a little further enlarge upon this Argument.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God ſuffereth <hi>ſo many ſinners, that ſome of them might be made Saints:</hi> by Nature <hi>there is none righteous, no not one, all are Children
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:192227:268"/>of wrath,</hi> one as well as another, all that are implanted into Chriſt, were natural branches of the wild Olive; they are made otherwiſe by an engraffing, and implantation into the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. (It is the Metaphor which the Apoſtle uſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 19.) Thoſe, all thoſe whom the Lord quickeneth, were at firſt <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> It is the ſaying of a very ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Author, <hi>Non eſt ſterilis Deo patientia ſua, ut ſaltem fatigatione taedeat peccatores voluptatum.</hi> Gods patience, ſaith he, with ſinners is not barren, if it were only for this, that God by ſuffering ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, many ſinners, doth at laſt tire, and weary ſome out of their delight and pleaſure in their luſts: thou that ſayeſt, why doth a pure, and holy God <hi>endure ſo many veſſels of wrath fitted for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> do but remember that thou thy ſelf wert once a Child of wrath, thou wert once a perſon fitted, both by Original ſin, and by many actual ſins for deſtruction; God ſuffered thee to go on a long time in thy own ways, that he might weary thee of thine own ways, and bring thee home unto himſelf; why may not God do ſo by many others? They are yet as wild Aſſes, but why may not they alſo have a moneth in which God may take them? The Children by adoption are picked out of the <hi>Children of wrath. Reſervat Deus injuſtos miſericordiae, per inducias juſtitiae.</hi> God by the truce of his juſtice, (as <hi>Nierembergius</hi> phraſeth it) that is, by forbearing the execution of his punitive, and vindicative Juſtice, reſerveth unrighteous perſons for mercy. This is one end doubtleſs of Gods enduring ſo many ſinners in the World, that he might bring ſome of them, even ſo many as he hath choſen unto life, to obtain eternal Salvation. But yet ſome will ſay why doth God permit ſuch as he knows his long ſuffering, and patience will never lead to repentance, let me a little anſwer thy curioſity in this, and ſhew thee, that even in this the Lords ways are equal and his wiſdom infinite.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether they well repent, and turn or no, it is but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that that God, who hath <hi>ſworn by his life that be deſires not the death of a ſinner, but had rather that he ſhould turn from his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and live, ſhould give them a time to repent;</hi> and how ſhould this be, if God ſhould not bear with them, and give them a ſpace of life? If they never were ſuffered to think a thought, how ſhould their own thoughts another day accuſe them? It is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of judgment againſt ſinners, That God gives them a ſpace of repentance, and they do not repent. How ſhould God
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:192227:269"/>condemn them for their filthy ſpeeches, their hard ſpeeches, their Oathes and Blaſphemies, if God ſhould not ſuffer them to vent theſe things? How ſhould they repent if they had no time to repent? If they will abuſe the patience of God, and after the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impenitency of their hearts treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, their blood is upon their own heads, God is vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in his Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The permiſſion of ſinners in the world ſeemeth reaſonable, <hi>that if they will not be made better, others may be made good by Gods patience toward them, and forbearance of them.</hi> If there were none of theſe Briars and Thorns in the world, how could God teach his people by them? Indeed this is one of Gods great ends in the permiſſion of ſinners. But let me open this a little in two or three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God by the exemplary puniſhment of them for their ſins oft-times turns others from their ſins.</hi> It is true, God doth not make all prodigious ſinners examples of his judgment in this life; but ſome he doth, and by it makes others to fear and tremble, and to avoid thoſe Rocks upon which their Souls ſplit. If I remember right it is reported of <hi>Waldus,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> that he was converted by the ſudden death of one of his companions: I know that examples of judgments are not Gods ordinary means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, nay they are rare inſtances of converts that are made that way, eſpecially where the word is ordinarily preached. When <hi>Dives</hi> in the goſpel fancied, that if one were ſent to his brethren from the dead they would believe, and avoid thoſe flames, he was told by <hi>Abraham,</hi> they had <hi>Moſes and the Prophets, and if upon the reading and hearing of them they would not believe, if one ſhould go from the dead they would not believe.</hi> Thoſe that harden their hearts under the word, are ordinarily judicially hardned againſt judgments, or other means that to the eye of reaſon ſeem probable means to change their hearts, but are not under a Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for that end, as the word of God is. But yet to ſome they are ſo far ſanctified; God ſometimes goeth out of his ordinary road. Beſides, though ſuch examples of judgment ſeldom prove ſole, and principal cauſes or means; yet they often prove partial cauſes, and ſocial means, and together with the word conduce much to ſuch a bleſſed end. I have known one my ſelf that hath owned the ringing of Bells, giving notice of perſons that he knew, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably died in their ſins, as a great means to awaken him to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:192227:269"/>of his ways and a change of heart and life, whiles his Soul reflected upon the ſound, and he ſaid to himſelf what ſhould become of me, if this Bell now rang for me; if my Soul (as this poor wretched creatures Soul) were now before the Judgment ſeat of Jeſus Chriſt. Princes the time they go to School uſe to have their <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbraes,</hi> ſome other perſon (I forget it may be the name they uſe to give them,) that they may be corrected for them, and their Prince by their correction might learn to take heed of errors. The elect of God, thoſe whom he hath foreordained to eternal life, they cannot die in their ſins, but God ſuffers ſome vile and wicked neighbours they have to periſh in their reaking luſts, and maketh this a means to awaken them, to conſider what ſin will at laſt bring them to.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God <hi>defameth ſin,</hi> by a <hi>plenty of ſinners.</hi> It is one of the idle pretences men in this age have for their filthy ſtage-plays, that ſin is there diſcredited by the repreſentation of it; and ſhewing the Spectators how ill it becomes men to be debaucht: the truth is, vertue, and ſobriety is diſcredited there (for in the debauchery of them our age hath exceeded all Heathens.) But for thoſe that will ſee the vileneſs and uglineſs of ſin, they need not ſee it in a play in <hi>effigy:</hi> they may ſee it more livelily in the converſe of their neighbours, and I doubt not but much ſin is reſtrained in the world, by the much ſin that is committed in the world: the reel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the drunkard from one ſide of the ſtreet to another, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth drunkenneſs, and the indecent immoralities of others both in their words, and actions, make ſin more abominable to many conſiderate Souls; as they ſay the fire is hotter in winter by the <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> of the cold, ſo the heat of love to God and zeal for him is advantaged by the exceſs of hatred to God, and his ways which they ſee in others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is yet a third way by which the ſinners of the <hi>world do good to the Saints,</hi> and that is, <hi>augendo fidem, &amp; ampliando patientiam,</hi> increaſing their faith and patience: every ſinner is a grieving thorne, and a pricking briar to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and by theſe briars and thorns God teacheth them (as it is ſaid that <hi>Gideon taught the men of ſuccoth.</hi>) It was the ſaying of an ancient writer, <hi>Nullus bonorum habet inimicum niſi malum, qui ideo eſſe permittitur ut vel ipſe corrigatur, vel per ipſum malus exerceatur;</hi> that is, no good man hath any enemy, but a wicked man, whom God doth therefore permit that either himſelf may be amended,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:192227:270"/>or the good man may by him be exerciſed. Thou that wondreſt why God permits ſo many ſinners in the world, wonder why there are ſo many rods, and ferulars for Children, why there are ſo many <hi>whipping-poſts</hi> and <hi>racks,</hi> ſo many <hi>bride wells,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Aſſyria</hi> is the rod of Gods anger, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. God hath many Children, and his Children will have their wanton vagaries, and extravagances, and muſt be brought through the world to Heaven, under the diſcipline of perſecutions, and many afflictions; wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane men in the world are Gods gaolers, and bride-well men, that keep his houſes of correction; when his ſervants are wanton and offend him, he ſends them to theſe gaolers, he turns them over unto wicked men. It was <hi>Davids</hi> curſe of his enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.6. <hi>Set thou a wicked man over him, and let</hi> Sathan <hi>ſtand at his right hand.</hi> God when his people offend him, ſometimes ſends them to the <hi>Extortioner,</hi> to catch all that they have: Sometimes to a <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Souldier,</hi> to ſpoile all their labour; ſometimes to a <hi>perſecutor,</hi> to rifle their houſes, and plunder their pleaſant things, to lay them up in gaoles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus a multitude of ſinners is neceſſary to Gods government of the world.</p>
                  <p>But yet (for we are very apt to diſpute with God) how is it that the providence of God ſuffers ſuch an exceſs of riot, ſuch a world of iniquity in the world; if ſome ſin be ſuffered, if ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners muſt be endured in the world, yet why ſo much ſin? Though an eaſy, and manifold anſwer might be eaſily drawn up to this from my former diſcourſe, yet let me add 3 or 4 things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Doſt thou that ſpeakeſt thus, conſider what a <hi>dependency there is of one ſin upon another, and what an uſe God maketh of one ſin to puniſh another?</hi> Let me a little diſcourſe each of theſe. The moraliſt ſaith, <hi>Virtutes ſunt concatenatae;</hi> Divines ſay as much of the graces of the Spirit of God, they have a cauſative virtue, and influence upon one another, <hi>patience worketh experience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hope.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, faith worketh by love, it is indeed productive both of love and hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is alſo true that <hi>Vitia ſunt concatenata,</hi> vices and ſinful habits are alſo link<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, and are productive one of another. <hi>Luſt conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> and <hi>brings forth, and ſin finiſheth</hi> and then <hi>bringeth forth death.</hi> And, as it is obſerved in nature, the moſt noxious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are moſt fruitful, and teeming; ſo vice and ſin is a moſt fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful teeming mother, one ſin bringeth forth a multitude of ſin. <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is the ordinary mother, of whoredom, filthy, and profane diſcourſe, quarrellings and contentions. <hi>Who hath contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:192227:270"/>who hath babling?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> in <hi>Pro.</hi> 23.29.) <hi>They that tarry long at the wine, they that go to ſeek for mixt wine.</hi> 2. Again, God in his <hi>providence</hi> maketh uſe of ſin <hi>to puniſh ſin.</hi> But the equity of God in that motion of his providence, God willing I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after more fully diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To quiet your thoughts upon this permiſſion of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, I ſhall offer to your conſideration what <hi>Nierembergius,</hi> an acute Author, (though a Papiſt) ſaith upon this argument, <hi>That the quantity of ſin which God permitteth in the world, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to what he bindreth in it.</hi> What a <hi>Brothel houſe</hi> of <hi>unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> what a Field of blood and oppreſſion? What an <hi>univerſal Ale houſe</hi> would the world be, were it not for the reſtrainings of Divine Grace? what but this hindereth, that every man is not a <hi>Cain</hi> unto his Brother, a <hi>Judas</hi> to his <hi>Maſter,</hi> that every one is not an <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> for luſt and luxury, as much a monſter of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty as <hi>Nero?</hi> The child of God jealous for the glory of God, is often ſtumbled to ſee ſo much ſin in the world; whereas he ſhould rather be taken up with the admiration of Divine Goodneſs, that there is no more prodigious wickedneſs committed in it. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulor</hi> (ſaith the afore-mentioned ingenious Author) <hi>compendium peccandi, ſupremae illi bonitati fontanae &amp; miſerationi quâ tantus malorum ardor extinguitur.</hi> Would you blame a man, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Houſe all on fire, ſhould quench that fire, and only leave ſome ſtraw burning in the Yard. The whole world lieth in wickedneſs, there is a great depth of luſt and ſin in all our hearts by nature. God ſo ordereth it in his Providence, that though he thinks fit to leave ſome luſt burning, yet he ſmothereth and reſtraineth the far greater part. He ſuffereth not the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part of that blaſphemy, that uncleanneſs, that drunkenneſs, that oppreſſion, fraud, cruelty and injuſtice which would be in the world, if he took off his hand of reſtraint from mens ſpirits. What he doth ſuffer, his infinite wiſdom knows how to make an advantagious uſe of, for the glory of his great name.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider <hi>that the time of ſinning beareth no proportion to that time, that the Creation ſhall be without ſin.</hi> The world hath laſted five or ſix thouſand years; (Chronologers differ in their calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations) how long it ſhall laſt none can tell: many have gueſſed and already find they have been miſtaken. But ſuppoſe (which is not very probable) that it ſhould laſt five, ſix, ten thouſand more: this indeed is a long time for the Devil (who is the god of this world) to reign, and have a kingdom in, and a world of ſin
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:192227:271"/>hath been committed, and is committed daily in the world, and doubtleſs will yet be committed, before God puts a period to the world, and to <hi>ſinning-time:</hi> but if it were twice ten thouſand years, what is that to eternity, that eternity that ſhall be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the day of Judgement, when there ſhall not be a ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, nor a ſinner ſeen? <hi>The wicked, and all they, who forget God, ſhall be turned into Hell.</hi> There ſhall not be the black patch of a ſin in the beautiful face of the <hi>new heavens and new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs;</hi> when that bleſſed time comes, it ſhall be all ſpent in praiſes and <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> Stumble not then at Gods Providence in permitting ſome ſin in the world, who hath made ſo good a proviſion for his own glory unto a long eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which alſo ſhall then be advantaged by the much ſin ſuffered in the world. For thoſe who have much forgiven <hi>them, will love much here,</hi> and praiſe God much, both here and hereafter: the high praiſes of God in the mouths of glorified ſaints, are doubtleſs elevated by the high and much ſin which they were guilty of in the world. You read <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. of many thouſands of Gods ſealed ones which <hi>John</hi> ſaw, and verſ. 9, 10. <hi>A great number which no man could count of all Nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues, that ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb; cloathed with white robes, and palms in their hands; who cryed with a loud voice, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to our God, who ſitteth upon the Throne, and to the lamb:</hi> and again, verſ. 12. <hi>Amen, bleſſing, and glory, and wiſdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might be given unto our God, for ever and ever.</hi> Now St. <hi>John</hi> deſiring to know who theſe were, had this anſwer. <hi>Theſe are they who are come out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the lamb: therefore are they before the Throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his Temple.</hi> Had they not been defiled with ſin, they needed not have waſhed their robes in the <hi>blood of the Lamb;</hi> and having their robes ſo waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are elevated in the praiſes of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Finally,</hi> We may, as I ſaid before, be aſſured that God would not ſuffer ſo much ſin in the world, <hi>If much ſin did not tend much to the glory of God at laſt.</hi> Here may be applied all that I ſaid before in the former part of my diſcourſe on this Argument: ſhewing you how the aboundings of ſin, conduce to the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="494" facs="tcp:192227:271"/>1. <hi>That grace wherein man is meerly paſſive and recipient, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> by the aboundings of ſin. The Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>that love covereth a multitude of faults:</hi> the more faults be covered, the greater love is diſcovered; God magnifieth grace in <hi>abundantly pardoning;</hi> and there could not be abundant pardoning, if there were not abounding ſin; a multitude of mercies could not be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, but upon a multitude of Sin. The bredth of the robes of Chriſts righteouſneſs could never have been ſeen but for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of our nakedneſs; it is the height, and depth, and length, and breadth of Sin, which maketh <hi>all Saints to comprehend what is the length, and breadth, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledg, that we might be filled with all the fulneſs of God,</hi> Eph. 3.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That grace in the exerciſe of which we are active, is alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged by the much Sin which God permitteth.</hi> Our Saviour telleth us, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. <hi>thoſe who have much forgiven will love much,</hi> and thoſe <hi>to whom little is forgiven will love but little.</hi> It wonderfully aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates pardoning mercy in the ſenſe of a gracious heart, to think how many are grinding at the ſame Mill of ſin, that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly imployed in, and that he ſhould be taken, and they left: again, we ſhould never fight the good fight ſo well to the glory of God, if we had not many enemies to fight with. But I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged far enough in the Doctrinal part of this diſcourſe, ſhewing you the reaſonableneſs of this motion of Divine providence in the ſufferance of ſin and ſinners, ſo much ſin and ſo many ſinners; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the oppoſition that ſin hath to the honour and glory of God, and to the purity and holineſs of the Divine being: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remains as to this diſcourſe, but to conſider how this may be uſeful to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. In the firſt place, Let me appeal now to the reaſon of every one that hears me, whether God in the ſufferance of Sin and ſinners, doth not act conſonantly to the wiſdom of the Divine being. It is nothing but our ignorance, and inconſiderateneſs, that can be any temptation to us to have any derogatory thoughts of God, for theſe motions of his providence; God doth all his own works in infinite wiſdom; and it is in infinite wiſdom, that he ſuffereth ſinful men to walk in their own ways. What though <hi>he be an holy God?</hi> This will indeed conclude, that himſelf cannot be tempted, and that he tempteth no man, but it will not argue
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:192227:272"/>that he may not ſuffer any one to be tempted, that is, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>James</hi> expoundeth it, <hi>drawn away by his own luſts, and enticed.</hi> What though he hath a <hi>power</hi> to put a period to ſin every moment, yet certainly God is not obliged to do all that he can do, but his power (as ours alſo is) is governed as to the exerciſe of it by his will. What though ſin diſhonoureth God, and impeacheth his glory, he knoweth how to vindicate himſelf, and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe himſelf as to his glory, and that many ways, from the ſins of men. True it is, that it is from the luſts and wickedneſs of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hearts that ſo much ſin is committed in the world, yet it is alſo from the ſufferance and permiſſion of Divine Providence. God being directed by his own infinite wiſdom to govern the world in this method, and thus to make a difference betwixt Earth and Heaven; ſo to order it, that hereby the veſſels of wrath may be fitted for deſtruction, and his choſen ones by many tribulations occaſioned generally from the ſins, and ſinners ſuffered in the world, may be prepared for the Kingdom of God. <hi>O the height and depth</hi> of Divine wiſdom?

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:192227:272"/>of it ſelf, or from any particular affection or diſpoſition in it, do any ſoul good; God indeed ſometimes turns it for good, ſo that a ſoul may ſay, <hi>it is good for me,</hi> that God ſuffered me to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a ſin. Sin in its own nature tendeth to nothing, but the ruine and eternal deſtruction of a Soul: it muſt be from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundings of grace, if any good come to the ſoul from ſin; the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundings of Divine grace in the free pardon, and forgiveneſs of ſin; or the aboundings of grace in the infuſion of gracious habits, by which the ſoul is made more broken-hearted, more humble in the ſenſe of ſin, more watchful againſt it for the time to come, and careful to avoid all temptations to it. <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> and the work of ſin tendeth to death, to debauch, and to debaſe a ſoul. If a ſinner getteth to eternal Life, it is through the gift of God; if by reaſon of his former ſinfulneſs, he now loves God more, and be more zealous for God, and more afraid to offend God, all this <hi>is of grace,</hi> and <hi>grace is free.</hi> Now reaſon teacheth every man, not wilfully to run upon his own ruine, in hope that he ſhall experience the kindneſs of a friend in ſuch a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined eſtate. Who will hang himſelf, that his friend may ſhew him kindneſs to cut the halter? or commit Treaſon againſt his Prince, to give him occaſion to pardon him? We uſe to account it no prudence to lye at the mercy of another, either as to our lives, eſtates, or reputations. Who will give away his eſtate, that the charity of his friends may appear in relieving him? The mercies of God are indeed beyond the mercies of men; but as infinite as they are, preſumptuous ſinners have no reaſon to lean upon them. Oh, conſider ſinner, that it muſt be <hi>through grace, if thou ere be ſaved.</hi> And though where ſin hath abounded, God ſometimes doth make grace to abound; yet it is not thy wiſdom to <hi>ſin that grace may abound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Grace, pardoning grace, doth not abound towards all in whom the aboundings of ſin are found:</hi> grace aboundeth but to ſome that have ſinned. How knoweſt thou (ſeeing grace is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>love acting freely</hi>) that it ſhall abound towards thee? If it doth not, thou periſheſt for ever: that it ſhall, thou doſt not know. Thouſands ſin, towards whom grace never aboundeth in the pardon of their ſins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>preſumptuous ſinning, is as great a block as it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thee to lay in the way of Divine grace. The ſoul that doth ought preſumptuouſly, the ſame reproacheth the Lord, and hath
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:192227:273"/>broken his commandment, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath deſpiſed the word of the Lord, and hath broken his commandment; that ſoul ſhall be utterly cut off, his iniquity ſhall be upon him,</hi> Numb. 15.30. Now what ſoul can poſſibly ſin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly, if he doth not, who ſaith in his heart, I will ſin that grace may abound?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, <hi>Conſider, duty is never to be meaſured by the event of our actions, but by the rule of our actions.</hi> If thou ſinneſt thou breakeſt the Law of the Lord, thou violateſt his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>deſpiſeſt his word.</hi> Sin in it ſelf is an inordinate action, and therefore to be avoided; though the Providence of God ordereth theſe actions very often, both to his own glory, and for the particular good of ſinners: we are to meaſure our actions by the Divine rule, and by that to ſquare them, not from the event of them which Divine Grace and Power maketh. Certainly, thou wilt ſay that <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe who were in a confederacy againſt the life of Chriſt, were all exceeding guilty before God, and will, ſome of them, in the great day, moſt righteouſly be turned into Hell, for crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him who was the Lord of life; though God uſed their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a means to procure the expiation, and atonement of the World: thouſands ſhall be ſaved by the effuſion of that blood, for the ſpilling of which yet they will be damned. What though God will ſuffer ſin to abound, that his Grace may much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; yet this is no licenſe for thee to ſuffer ſin to abound, thou art to guide thy action by the Divine rule. God governeth his by his own infinite Wiſdom, God makes the beſt of thy bad mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; but yet it is thy concern to make the beſt market thou canſt, both for thy own ſoul, and for the glory of God.</p>

                     <hi>Conſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> What if God may get himſelf glory, and may get himſelf glory from peoples ſins; yet this glory, 1. <hi>May be from others, not from thee.</hi> 2. <hi>It may be only a glory gotten upon thee.</hi> 1. I ſay, firſt, poſſibly the glory which God will get from thy ſins, ſhall be <hi>from others, not from thy ſelf.</hi> Many times, the ſin which maketh the ſinner worſe, ſubjecting him to the wrath and vengeance of God, debauching and defiling his ſoul, makes others better; ſo God hath a glory from his ſin. The perſecutor tries the <hi>faith and patience</hi> of the Saints, and is a means to help
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:192227:273"/>them to the Kingdom of Heaven, and ſo God hath glory from his ſin; but it is from others, not from the ſinner; he in the mean time damneth, and deſtroyeth his own ſoul. 2. Poſſibly God will get himſelf <hi>glory upon thee,</hi> upon occaſion of thy ſin, as he ſaid, <hi>I will get me honour upon Pharaoh:</hi> That was by breaking him in pieces, by deſtroying both him and his Army in the Red Sea. This is ſmall encouragement to thee to go on in ſinning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God will get glory from thy ſins; thou canſt not aſſure thy ſelf, that he will get himſelf the glory of his pardoning, or ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace from them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wilt thou ſay, But if I may bring glory to God, I ought to do it, though it be by my damnation? Conſider, <hi>That no man can in any ſincerity, pretend to the willing of the glory of God by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> The Reaſon is, becauſe ſin is directly oppoſite to Gods Glory. What ſenſe is it <hi>to will the glory of God by diſhonouring him?</hi> Sin is a thing, which of its own nature diſhonoureth and reproacheth God. Canſt thou pretend to deſign the honour and glory of God, by doing that which is directly contrary to it? It is a queſtion, whether our reaſonable natures will ſuffer us to will the glory of God in our own damnation? but it is impoſſible, that any ſhould ſincerely wiſh the glory of God, and purſue this wiſh by wilful and preſumptuous ſinning.</p>

                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. I anſwer, <hi>Becauſe the judgment of God is a righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he proceedeth againſt men according to their actions, and the merit of them, not according to the event of their actions, wiſely ordered, beſides, and beyond their natural tendency to the glory of his own holy name:</hi> That the ſinners works iſſue in the glory of God, is Gods work, not theirs; and they can therefore expect no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon that account. Beſides, the eventual neceſſity which the Providence of God puts upon things, doth by no means juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the obliquity of the actions. Our Saviour tells us, <hi>it muſt needs be, that offences come; but woe be to thoſe by whom they come.</hi> It muſt needs be that ſin ſhould be committed in the World: God hath determined to permit them, mens luſts hurry them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the commiſſion of them; Gods Providence muſt fetch him a
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:192227:274"/>great deal of glory from them; but yet, woe be to the ſinner, without a timely repentance.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 3. In the laſt place, Doth God in infinite Wiſdom (as you have heard) permit ſin in the World, and that for the end that I have ſhewed you, <hi>that he might be glorified? Let us then make it our buſineſs, to make ſuch uſes of the ſin that we ſee in the world, and the ſins our ſelves have committed in the world, as by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of them God may be more glorified by us.</hi> If you ask me how this may be, it may eaſily be gathered from my preceding diſcourſe; but yet for the ſake of thoſe who are of meaner capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, let me in this branch of Application recapitulate a little, 1. For the ſins of others which we ſee permitted in the World.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us be quickened upon the view of them to adore the patience, and long-ſuffering of God.</hi> Doſt thou hear a wretch curſe and blaſpheme, and profane the great and dreadful name of God, and defie the God of Heaven, challenging his own damnation? and doeſt thou ſee God ſuffering him to live from year to year, and to go on in this courſe? Doeſt thou ſee another in the heighth of rage againſt the people of God, endeavouring if it were poſſible to root out all Religion, and dayly devouring thoſe that are more righteous than himſelf? Let it help thee to recognize the patience of God, do thou upon occaſion of others profaneneſs and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, give God the glory of his <hi>patience.</hi> Let it make thee many a time reflect and ſay, O what a patient God is the God in whom I truſt! he ſeeth theſe vile wretches, he could as eaſily cruſh them, as I with my foot can cruſh a worm; yet he ſpareth them, and with much long ſuffering, endures the veſſels of wrath fitted for Hell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let the view of the ſins of others which thou ſeeſt God permitting for his own wiſe ends, make thee <hi>adore the wiſdom of God.</hi> Thou art poſed to think what glory God can procure to himſelf, from the profaneneſs and blaſphemy of wicked men; but God will certainly do it, and would never ſuffer their profaneneſs, if he did not know how to do it. <hi>O! the infinite wiſdom of God,</hi> that can make the wrath of man to praiſe him! Let thy heart be affected with that meditation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, Doeſt thou ſee the world of ſin that abounds, doeſt thou hear of prodigious luſts, blaſphemies, cruelties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which make thy ſoul tremble? Let God upon this occaſion, <hi>have the
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:192227:274"/>glory of his free-mercy and grace towards thy ſoul.</hi> Bleſs God that he hath given thee another ſpirit. Say, <hi>Lord,</hi> why was not I as one of theſe? I had the ſame ſeed of ſin in me, my heart was as full of original luſt and corruption as theirs? Oh! what reaſon have I to adore the free grace of God, that I am not as this beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drunkard, as this unclean wretch, as this monſtrous blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer! If it had not been for free and rich grace, I had been as bad as they: It is that which made me to differ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But let God have glory from us upon the occaſion of his ſo long ſuffering us to walk in our own ways. Now that may be many ways, let me a little particularly direct here alſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Let it make thee live in a dayly admiration of free-grace, both in pardoning thy former guilt, and in renewing, and changing thy heart.</hi> This, this is a work not for a rapture, not for an hour, or a day; but for eternity. It will doubtleſs be a great piece of our work when we come to Heaven, to cry <hi>ſalvation to our God and to the Lamb. Bleſſing, and glory, and honour, and wiſdom, and thanksgiving be to the Lord for ever and ever.</hi> It ſhould be much of our work upon the earth, if we have either obtained the ſenſe of the pardon of our ſins, or a good hope through grace: you ſhall find St. <hi>Paul</hi> beginning moſt of his Epiſtles with ſuch a <hi>bleſſing of God.</hi> O you redeemed of the Lord, you that are come out of a ſtate of deep guilt, you can never think, nor ſpeak enough, what God hath done for your ſouls. It is a great work of God, and he doth his great works, that they may be had in remembrance. Let God have ſome glory from thee, for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning thoſe ſins by which he hath been much diſhonoured by thee; and as for his pardoning, ſo for his <hi>ſanctifying grace.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire God, bleſs God upon the view of thy former hard heart, profane and unclean ſpirit; ſay, Ah Lord! that ever ſuch an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian</hi> as I was, ſhould through grace change my skin, that ever ſuch a rebellious ſpirit ſhould be made obedient, ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane wretch ſhould ever have an heart toward Heaven; that ever one that loved his luſts ſo well as I have done, ſhould be taught of God to love him, and fear him, and delight in him! that a <hi>Saul ſhould be amongſt the Prophets!</hi> a <hi>Paul</hi> a perſecutor, a blaſphemer ſhould be amongſt the Apoſtles! a <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſhould waſh her Lords feet, and be ſo humbled, as to wipe them with the hairs of her head! the offering up of theſe praiſes glorifieth God.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="502" facs="tcp:192227:275"/>2. Let thy former ſins make thee <hi>more abundant in peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential tears, and in confeſſions of thy ſin unto God.</hi> God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to hear a ſoul acknowledg its iniquities, and take ſhame to it ſelf. Let thy reflection upon thy former ways, make thee with <hi>Peter to weep bitterly,</hi> make thee go alone, and confeſs thy ſins unto him that hath forgiven them; the more vile thou makeſt and owneſt thy ſelf, the more thou glorifieſt God, as a God of free grace, and infinite mercy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let thy <hi>former ſins</hi> ingage thee to <hi>love God more. Hath much been forgiven thee, O love much:</hi> Say with thy ſelf, O, I can never love God enough, I can never do enough for him. I that have done ſo much againſt him, I that have been ſo profane, ſo vile, that have ſpent my youth and ſtrength in the ſervice of my baſe luſts and pleaſures, and am yet received to mercy at laſt; What ſhall I render unto the Lord? Let my burning love to God, and whatſoever beareth his image and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, make ſome amends for my burning luſts, which had conſumed my poor ſoul, if God had not mercifully quenched them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let thy former ſins, and thy reflections upon them, make thee to <hi>walk ſoftly,</hi> and <hi>humbly, with God all the days of thy life.</hi> Doeſt thou find thy heart at any time begin to ſwell in an high opinion of thy ſelf? Say, my ſoul, What hath a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be proud on? what haſt thou that haſt been ſo filthy, ſo polluted to glory in? High thoughts become not one that hath been ſo dirty, ſo polluted, and unclean as thou haſt been.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let <hi>your reflections upon your ſins, bring forth that brood of graces</hi> which the Apoſtle mentioneth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11, <hi>Indignation, carefulneſs, fear, vehement deſires, revenge;</hi> Indignation at your ſelves for your former errors. Anger never hath a truer object, than when it is exerciſed upon our ſelves for our miſcarriages. <hi>Revenge,</hi> a revenge upon our ſelves, this doubtleſs lieth much in acts of <hi>mortification,</hi> and <hi>ſelf denial;</hi> mens denying themſelves in the lawful uſe of the liberty of thoſe things which they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſmfully abuſed. <hi>Fear,</hi> a fear of again ſalling into ſuch remp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as they had before been overcome with. <hi>A Care</hi> in looking to your ways, and vehement deſires in all things to pleaſe God, and to walk more perfectly before him.</p>

Finally, You ſhall make an improvement of your ſins, if your reflexions upon your former ſins, both of omiſſion and commiſſion, ſhall <hi>engage you to more frequent acts of homage to him,</hi> to be more in <hi>prayer,</hi> in <hi>praiſe,</hi> in <hi>hearing,</hi> &amp;c. Thus it was with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he reflected upon himſelf, <hi>as not meet to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe he had perſecuted the Church of Chriſt.

                  <p>THe words which I have read to you, are the words of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> the <hi>Temanite,</hi> unto his friend <hi>Job,</hi> who <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. had made ſo bitter a complaint of his afflictions: whether he had this title from his Anceſtors, as ſome think, <hi>Gen.</hi> 36.11. where we read of one <hi>Eliphaz</hi> (a deſcendent from <hi>Eſau,</hi> who begat <hi>Teman),</hi> or from his Countrey (which I take to be moſt probable); for we read <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.7. <hi>concerning Edom, thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Is wiſdom no more in Teman?

This <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in probability was an <hi>Edomite,</hi> an inhabitant of <hi>Teman,</hi> a friend of <hi>Job,</hi> who by appointment was come with the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to viſit <hi>Job,</hi> upon the report of his great affliction: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:192227:276"/>his diſcourſe in the former Chapter, and continueth it in this.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the hand of God was in his affliction;</hi> for that is implied, when he ſaith, <hi>Affliction cometh not out of the duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>From the conſideration of the fate of man. Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is born unto trouble, as the ſparks fly upward.</hi> The Propoſition of theſe two Verſes, is plainly this:</p>
                  <p>Prop. <hi>That God hath a great hand in all the evils that come upon us.</hi> Man is born unto trouble, and it is as natural to him, as for the ſparks to move upward, and his afflictions come not out of the duſt. It is the obſervation of an Eminent Divine of our own (in his excellent commentary upon this Verſe), that this is a <hi>Proverbial ſpeech,</hi> and the ſenſe of it, <hi>That affliction cometh not by chance or fortune;</hi> and ſo <hi>the duſt,</hi> and <hi>the ground</hi> in my Text ſtands oppoſed, 1. <hi>To God,</hi> and 2. To <hi>our ſelves.</hi> What if I ſhould offer my thoughts, that it is an <hi>Eliptical ſpeech,</hi> and much parallel to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.6, 7. <hi>For promotion cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South: But God is the Judg, he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another:</hi> So here <hi>affliction</hi> ſpringeth not out of the duſt, nor trouble out of the ground, <hi>but God hath an hand in all;</hi> only this latter part is left to us to be underſtood. My preſent deſign will not lead me to conſider how far man is <hi>felo de ſe</hi> and the author of his own evils, having the meritorious cauſe in his own ſoul; but I ſhall only diſcourſe of God as the <hi>efficient cauſe,</hi> the other will fall in, as that which moveth God to ſuch an execution of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p>Here are two branches in the Propoſition.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That man is born unto affliction and trouble, as the ſparks fly upward;</hi> it may be underſtood that he hath a right to it, as the ſparks have by the Law of Creation, diſpoſing and ordaining them to ſuch a motion; ſo man hath a legal right to trouble, by vertue of the firſt Covenant, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye.</hi> Now this man hath as a ſinner depraved, and fallen from that Original rectitude in which God created him. 2. <hi>He hath a natural fitneſs and diſpoſition to it,</hi> and is by his nature ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:192227:276"/>to a variety of <hi>afflictions</hi> and <hi>troubles.</hi> As the ſparks, by reaſon of their levity, have an aptneſs to move upward; ſo hath man through his natural conſtitution, ever ſince the <hi>craſis</hi> of his humours was impaired and ſpoiled upon the fall, a native fitneſs and diſpoſition to receive impreſſions of affliction and trouble.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this <hi>trouble, theſe afflictions come not upon us by chance, but by the hand of God.</hi> It was the ſaying of a good Prophet, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.33. <hi>This evil is of the Lord.</hi> The Prophet ſpeaks of evils more generally, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall there be any evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> and verſ. 5. <hi>Can a bird fall in a ſnare on the earth, where no gin is for him?</hi> And this is true of all ſpecies of <hi>penal evils,</hi> which we call <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> whether they fall upon our <hi>bodies</hi> or <hi>ſpirits,</hi> or in our <hi>eſtates,</hi> or from our <hi>relations,</hi> &amp;c. The Queſtion is,</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How this is conſiſtent with the goodneſs and mercy of God? Can God be the Author of evil?</hi> Lam. 3.33, 34. <hi>He doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict willingly, nor grieve the children of men to cruſh under his feet all the priſoners of the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The anſwer is very eaſie, <hi>there is an evil of ſin;</hi> of this God cannot be the Author, he can neither be <hi>tempted with evil,</hi> nor tempt any man: but there is an <hi>evil of puniſhment,</hi> indeed in it ſelf not evil, as I ſhall ſhew more by and by. Of this none doubteth but God may be the Author, yea there is no evil of this nature in the City, which he hath not done.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor is this at all inconſiſtent, either with the purity and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the mercy and goodneſs of God;</hi> for, as I ſaid before, <hi>theſe kind of evils are only nuncupatively ſo,</hi> and have no more evil in them, than as they are ingrateful to our pallats, and but nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named evils by us, following the fallible judgment of our ſenſes. <hi>Quae vulgus infamat malorum titulo arcanis ſuae benignitatis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crevit;</hi> God in his eternal thoughts of love, hath decreed the effecting thoſe things which we ſcandalize with the name of Evils: Evils of puniſhment are <hi>good</hi> under a diſguiſe, and we ſhould not call them Evils, if ſenſe did not caſt a miſt before our eyes. 'Tis ſenſe, deceivable ſenſe, that both makes us call the <hi>real evils</hi> of ſin <hi>good,</hi> and the real <hi>good things of afflictions, and troubles, evil.</hi> When God once diſpelleth this miſt, and opens the eyes of the ſpiritual underſtanding, it ſees after another manner, and it then
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:192227:277"/>crys out with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray, but now I have kept thy word.</hi> Verſ. 71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy ſtatutes.</hi> Thus the child, when it comes to underſtanding, bleſſeth the <hi>rods</hi> and <hi>feru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's</hi> with which he was corrected; and which, when he was a child he deprecated, and would gladly have cut in pieces. Let me ſhew you a little, that theſe things which we diſgrace with the name of Evils, and of which the <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>gracious God</hi> is not aſhamed to be the Author; are not Evils, but ſuch as deſerve a better name, and ſuch good things as are ſome of the greateſt goods the child of God meets with on this ſide of Heaven. To this purpoſe we will conſider them,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As they contribute to the Predication of the Holineſs and Juſtice of God,</hi> and the making him to be feared and adored in the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As they many ways contribute to the happineſs of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I ſay, firſt, as they predicate the glory of Gods Juſtice and Holineſs.</hi> Juſtice and Holineſs are two eminent Attributes of the Divine Being, ſo eſſential unto it, as if he ſhould not be <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> he could not be God. Now the Holineſs and Juſtice of God could never be ſo known in the world, but for the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, troubles, and puniſhments which are abroad in it; God is infinitely removed from our ſenſes, we can only read him in his word, and in his works. The word of God evidenceth theſe two Attributes to us by faith, for the word is the object of faith, and faith is the evidence of things not ſeen. The word of God ſpeaketh God a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> God, and therefore we believe it: but as in a State, the Juſtice of the Magiſtrates would never be ſeen in making good Laws, and diſcourſing juſt things, if he never put them in execution; ſo neither ſhould we ever have any demonſtration of the Juſtice and Holineſs of God, if it were not for thoſe afflictions and puniſhments of ſinners, by which he declareth to the world his abhorrence of ſin, and the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Juſtice. I remember the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. telleth us, <hi>That Chriſt was ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare Gods righteouſneſs:</hi> and God being about to deſtroy <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will get me honour upon Pharaoh.</hi> What honour? the honour of his Juſtice and Righteouſneſs. It is the great intereſt of God, to declare unto the world his Juſtice and
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:192227:277"/>Holineſs; How elſe ſhould he have the revenue of his glory from theſe Attributes? Now I ſay, Evils of puniſhment are upon this account great goods, and were neceſſary, if they were cauſative of no other than this good. If God obtained no more from them, than the Proclamation of his Holineſs, and Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, yet this were enough: and thus much he gains from his puniſhment of the worſt of men; if they be not made better by them, yet God is by them made more glorious, and declareth his righteouſneſs. The argument is this: Thoſe things cannot be evil, however we may miſcall them, which immediately tend to make God more glorious in the eyes of the world: but this all Evils of puniſhment do, they ſpeak God a pure and holy God, and a juſt and righteous God. But there is much more to be ſaid than this is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>They very much contribute to the good of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved.</hi> 1. They contribute to make us better while we live here; and, 2. To make us eternally happy hereafter. It is only the fooliſh child that (as I ſaid before) quarrelleth at the rods and ferula's that correct the wildneſs and wantonneſs of its youth. The grown man bleſſeth God, and thanks his maſter for them: <hi>He that ſpareth the rod,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, hateth the child: but he that loveth him, chaſteneth him betimes,</hi> Prov. 13.24. and adviſing Parents, again ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.13, 14. <hi>Withhold not correction from the child; for if thou beateſt him with the rod, he ſhall not dye: thou ſhalt beat him with the rod, and ſhalt deliver his ſoul from hell.</hi> In ſhort, 1. By <hi>afflictions, Souls ordained to life, are kept from hell.</hi> 2. By <hi>afflictions, ſuch ſouls are fitted for the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay, firſt, <hi>By afflictions, as by a divine ſacred means, the ſouls of ſuch as are ordained unto life, are ſaved from hell.</hi> If mans rod may be a means to ſuch a bleſſed end, Gods rod will certainly do much more: <hi>the rod and reproof give wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 29.15. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>That fooliſhneſs is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction ſhall drive it far from him,</hi> Prov. 22.15. It is as true as to the Children of God, as it is with reference to the Children of men. Have not you obſerved a tender Mother, ſometimes ſeeing a fooliſh child too buſie with the fire, or candle, taking the childs hand, or finger, and holding it ſo near, that it ſcalds, or burns it ſelf, ſo learning the burnt child to dread the fire? God hath never a child, but is too too
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:192227:278"/>ready to be playing with hell-fire, playing over the hole of the Aſp, and den of the Cockatrice. God takes his childrens fingers, and ſcalds them a little with the fire of Hell in their Conſciences, making them to be a continual terror, inſtead of a continual feaſt, or with the Candles of Afflictions and outward trials, and thus they are delivered from Hell. <hi>Adam</hi> had never ſeen death, he had only heard of it in the threatning, in caſe he did eat of the Tree that ſtood in the midſt of the Garden: he put out his hand and took of the fruit, and did eat, his poſterity ſhall now ſee and feel death; they ſhall be in <hi>deaths often,</hi> and have leiſure to think, if the torments of the <hi>ſtone,</hi> or the <hi>gout</hi> be ſo great, what will the torments of Hell be? If I am not able to ſtand under the terrors of an affrighted Conſcience for a few months, how ſhall I abide everlaſting wrath? That ſo he may be more wary and afraid. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the truth of the word, have a great force with our unbelieving hearts. God hath therefore in infinite wiſdom and goodneſs, ſo ordered it, that one while his people ſhall be in the fire of a Fever, another while in the darkneſs of a divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. By the firſt they ſhall learn to conclude how hot the fire of Hell muſt be; by the later, how dreadful that utter darkneſs ſhall be, which ſhall be the impenitent ſinners portion: what it is to be forſaken of God for ever, upon the hearing that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſentence, <hi>Depart from me you curſed, into everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> They ſhall ſometimes find Satan at their right hand, to learn them what it is to be with the Devils to all eternity; they ſhall ſometimes want bread to eat, and water to quench their thirſt, and left from thence to conclude, what the condition of a <hi>Dives</hi> is, that would in thoſe flames be glad of a cup of cold water to cool his tongue: they ſhall have extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of pains for a little time in ſome particular joynts and limbs, and thence gather what the torments of the whole body and ſoul muſt be for ever and ever; when all the Vials of Divine wrath ſhall be poured out upon them. I do not doubt, but many a ſoul in glory, is this day bleſſing God for its life of trials, pains and afflictions; and could we hear them ſpeak, they would tell us, they were beholden in a great meaſure, to the thouſands of little hells, they ſuffered here, for the Heaven to which they have crouded, through much tribulation, and waded through many waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> which they found it difficult (while they were in their delicate fleſh) to drink of, becauſe their taſt was bitter.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="509" facs="tcp:192227:278"/>2. By afflictions and troubles <hi>the ſaints are fitted for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> They are ſuch good things as accompany ſalvation, and make the heirs of ſalvation fit for the Kingdom of God. We muſt be <hi>made meet for the inheritance of the ſaints in light</hi> before we come to it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. and we are made ſo by afflictions in a great meaſure. Do you ſometimes ſee ſome beautiful ſtones in a famous ſtructure, ſhining with variety of Colours, and adorning the places where they are? How came they (think you) by this beauty? were they only beholden to the Painter for an ingenious mixture, and laying on of colours? This would never have made them ſo without hewing, and ſmoothing, and poliſhing; but both theſe together complete their beauty. The Stone-cutter firſt hews off their roughneſs and poliſheth them; then the Painter layeth his colours upon them. Amongſt other expreſſions, by which the Scripture expreſſeth the bleſſed ſtate of the ſaints, this is one promiſe, Rev. 3.12. <hi>I will make him that overcometh a pillar in the houſe of my God.</hi> To make a Soul a Pillar, a beautiful glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Pillar in the Houſe of God; it is not enough that the holy ſpirit comes, and like a Painter adorneth the ſoul with its varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of gracious habits; but the Providence of God (eſpecially as to ſome of them, who are of courſer rougher conſtitutions,) muſt alſo come and hew, and cut, and poliſh them, with varieties of trials and afflictions; and thus they become at laſt beautiful Pillars, beautiful for faith and patience, for ſelf denial and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſtrong to bear the croſs, and ſubmiſſive to the burthen of it. Thus by many tribulations they enter into the Kingdom of God; by many tribulations, not only as the road to Heaven, the dark entry into that place of light, but as means fitting them for Heaven; Files, filing off that ruſt with which they could never enter in there. Even the man according to Gods own heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that <hi>before he was afflicted, he went aſtray;</hi> and that his afflictions had contributed to his learning of the Lords Statutes. We ſillily call afflictions evils; but <hi>conſider thy ſelf</hi> (ſaith an acute Author) how often haſt thou been made better by thoſe things, thoſe afflictions which thou defameſt with the name of evils? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> lamented, that a Fever had corrected that luſt in him, which the love of God, and the meditation of that could not extinguiſh. Certainly the ſame reaſon which forbids us to call that good which maketh us worſe, will likewiſe reſtrain us from calling that <hi>evil</hi> which maketh us better. God doth <hi>ex di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpendio
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:192227:279"/>naturae, parare compendium gratiae;</hi> (in the phraſe of an ingenious Writer) he maketh the outward man decreaſe, that the inward man may by it increaſe: ſo that troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſeem but Divine inventions to make the ſaints both more holy, and more happy. How ſhould we have lien grovelling on the earth, if God had not prepared us there a bed of thorns; and lien always ſucking at the worlds breaſts, if God had not rubbed them with this wormwood? How often would the pitifully wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton heart of a good Chriſtian have been priding it ſelf at a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, if God had not ſpoiled her ſmooth face with the Small Pox, or ſome other deforming diſeaſe? How often is the love and delight of a ſoul canton'd out to a Wife or an Husband, to a Child or a Friend; and how little a ſhare hath God of it, until he cuts off theſe ſuckers from the roots of our ſouls? How little time can a man or woman oft times find for Meditation or Prayer, for examining his heart, and reflecting upon his ways, till God ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him up in a Priſon, in a ſick Chamber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do? then he cries with the Church, <hi>Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.</hi> How little, how ſeldom ſhould we with any ſeriouſneſs, or in any ſolemn manner remember God, if God ſometimes did not forget us? When ſhould we be willing to entertain thoughts of a better life, of a more enduring ſubſtance, if we always had full meaſures of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of this life? The uncertainty we have of earthly riches, makes us look for the more enduring ſubſtance. A baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from our Country, or daily perſecution and vexation in it, makes us think of, and prepare for a better Country. By dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily, we become willing to dye, and to be with Chriſt. If we did not ſee the gourds that refreſh us, and keep the heats of the world from our heads, come up in a night, and go down by an Eaſt wind the next night, we ſhould cry, it is good for us to be here, let us build us Tabernacles. We ſhould be married to the world, and unwilling ever to think of a divorce, or a being marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt, if God did not ſometimes let us experience that we had a lye in our right hand, were fond of a picture, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a ſhadow. The Gaols, and priſons of the earth make the earth more bitter, and the liberty of the ſons of God more ſweet. The pains of the earth, and the labours of the world, make the reſt of Heaven and the joys thereof more deſirable. Beſides, that faith and patience are no Summer-graces: if we ſhould never have
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:192227:279"/>any Winters, when ſhould they have any exerciſe? Tribulation worketh patience, and the hour of trial is the time for its perfect work. But this were almoſt an infinite Theme to diſcourſe in its latitude, the variety of good which floweth to the ſouls of Gods people from afflictions and troubles; they are by them tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, purged, made white; they are by them made more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and humble, all which good juſtly entituleth God to a being the Author of them; they do not only flow from his juſtice, as the juſt puniſhments of ſin, but they are the noble effluxes of his goodneſs, and are ſo far from derogating from the glory of that, that they exceedingly tend to the commendation of it; and we are miſtaken in the notion of them when we call them evils, and make up the judgement meerly from ſenſe, which indeed ſo nick-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them. I know indeed there is another <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty here, and that is, how it can ſtand <hi>with the juſtice of God</hi> to puniſh his people for thoſe ſins for which he hath accepted a <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and given an acquittance in the actual juſtification of a ſinner, and the forgiveneſs of his ſins? but I have ſpoken to that before, when I ſpake to that Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That God with the afflictions of this life, doth often puniſh paſt, and pardoned ſins.</hi> I ſhall therefore paſs on to the application of this diſcourſe, which I ſhall diſpatch in two words of exhortation. 1. <hi>To own God in all your troubles and afflictions.</hi> The ſecond ſhall be <hi>to ſtudy ſuch an improvement of your afflictions, as inſtead of quarrelling at Divine Providence in theſe diſpenſations, you may ſee reaſon to bleſs God for them.</hi>

In the firſt place, <hi>Doth not affliction ſpring out of the ground, nor trouble out of the duſt?</hi> O then, in the day of your troubles <hi>look not only upon the ground,</hi> let not your eyes be meerly upon the duſt. It is the ſilly Dog that runs after the ſtone that is thrown at him, and biteth that: wiſer creatures (ſuch as man is) overlook that, and conſider the hand that hurled it. Afflictions of all ſorts, are but ſtones out of the ſling of Divine Providence, they are Gods meſſengers; he ſaith to the Diſeaſe, go, and it goeth; come, and it cometh. Art thou ſick? ſee the Lord calling for the diſeaſe that diſordereth thee.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This would turn our eye</hi> (in the days of our afflictions) <hi>upon our hearts,</hi> and make men think of <hi>ſearching and trying their hearts, and turning again unto the Lord.</hi> While men think of their afflictions as ſpringing out of the ground, and ariſing meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the duſt, the natural accident of their frail bodys, which being duſt, muſt be crumbled again to duſt by ſuch means, they only look to the Phyſician for a repair of their lapſed health; while they only eye their troubles as ariſing from men, they look for nothing but a Buckler to defend themſelves, or ſome cudgel to threſh their adverſaries with, requiting them for the evil they have done them. But when they come once to ſee God in their afflictions, and to look upon them as coming from a Divine hand, from the great God of Heaven and Earth, then they begin to
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:192227:281"/>ſmite upon their thighs, and to ſay, <hi>What have we done?</hi> Let this be therefore our buſineſs, of what kind ſoever our Affliction be.</p>

In the ſecond place, let not this only engage us to own God as the author of our evils of puniſhment, but alſo to <hi>apply our ſelves unto God</hi> as to him who alone can help us in our times of trouble. Nature directs it; how ready are we in our bodily pains and afflictions to cry out—<hi>O God help me,</hi> &amp;c. I remember the ſaying of our Divine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet.

In the laſt place, let us learn from hence, inſtead of quarrelling at Divine Providence and Juſtice in afflicting, <hi>ſo to behave our ſelves under our troubles, as we may ſee cauſe to bleſs God for them, and to admire Divine goodneſs in them. Nazianzene</hi> telleth us a ſtory of one <hi>Philagrius,</hi> who in his affliction brake out into this expreſſion, <hi>Gratias ago tibi Pater! tuorum<expan>

Then</hi> ſaith he <hi>a man remembreth that there is a God, and that he is but a man, then he admireth none, envieth none, deſpiſeth none; then he neither heareth nor carrieth falſe tales. O</hi> (ſaith he)
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:192227:281"/>
                     <hi>that we could be as well, when we are well as when we are ſick.</hi> This is that I could wiſh too. But the worſt is, we are very religious, and innocent when we are in affliction, but when we are got out of the net we are as fooliſh, and wanton as before. God by <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>affliction</hi> for the time doth us good, <hi>Subtiliſſima ejus beneficia</hi> (ſaith an ingenious Author) <hi>Sponte dantur ſed non ſponte recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untur.</hi> But for the moſt part, that goodneſs proveth like a <hi>morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-dew.</hi> But in order to the improving trouble, and affliction, let me only commend to you four things with which I ſhall ſhut up my diſcourſe on this argument.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>Meditation.</hi> Affliction is a ſeaſonable time for much Meditation. It is a fit time for thee to meditate wherefore it is that God contendeth with thee, <hi>Job</hi> 10.2. <hi>I will ſay unto God do not condemn me, ſhew me wherefore thou contendeſt with me.</hi> The time of affliction is a fit time, when <hi>man ſits alone, and keepeth ſilence;</hi> and the noiſes and hurries of the World do not diſturb him, to be thinking what he hath done, communing with his own heart upon his bed; and certainly this will have a good influence upon thee, if thy ſickneſs will make thee avoid eating a diſh of meat for the time to come; which appeareth to thee, the proximate cauſe of thy diſeaſe, ſurely it will lay ſome Law upon thee as to the favouring of ſuch luſts, which appear to have been the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote cauſe provoking God in that diſpenſation againſt thee. It is alſo a fit time for thee to <hi>meditate of the vanity of all the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Non domus &amp; fundus non aeris acervus &amp; auri,</hi>
                     </l>

                        <hi>Aegroto domini deduxit corpore febrim.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>Experience then teacheth a man. That <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath;</hi> all a mans houſe, and Land, and Gold, and Silver, will not relieve him in a Fever; what a pitiful thing is <hi>beauty,</hi> or <hi>ſtrength,</hi> which one fit of ſickneſs depriveth us of, what a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table excrement is <hi>well ſet hair;</hi> which a cough turns into baldneſs? what vain things are fine clothes, which in ſickneſs are exchanged for rags? It is a ſeaſonable time alſo for thee to meditate of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs, what a mercy it is that the <hi>Rattle ſnake</hi> hath a <hi>rattle;</hi> The <hi>Tyger,</hi> another beaſt to give warning of 'tis being near? that thou haſt diſeaſes to put thee in remembrance of thy latter end? It is a fit time alſo for thee to meditate of the power of Divine wrath?</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="516" facs="tcp:192227:282"/>2. <hi>Vow unto God in the day of thy trouble; Jacob</hi> did ſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. So did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 132.2. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſamiſt</hi>) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member David and all his afflictions, how he ſware unto the Lord, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob. Jonah</hi> did ſo, <hi>Jonah.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But then <hi>remember to pay thy vows. Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God,</hi> Pſal. 76.11. Better you ſhould not vow, than that you ſhould forget to pay what you have vowed. This were to ſnare thy ſelf in the words of thy own lips.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To this end (laſtly) <hi>Pray that you may keep your ſick bed impreſſions upon your hearts.</hi> In your troubles, you had thoughts of your eternal ſtate upon your hearts, then you were thinking what you ſhould do if you ſhould be called to Gods judgment-ſeat. Then you were ſaying, If I live, I will be another man, I will keep Sabbaths better, be more in Prayer, more in reading, and hearing the word, more watchful over my heart, more careful of my ways, more conſcientious in my dealings, more ſtrict in my Family. If ever I recover, I will by the grace of God never be ſo worldly, ſo carnal as I have been: well thou art recovered, now pray that thou mayeſt fulfil thy vows, and that theſe impreſſions may not be off thy heart for ever.</p>

                     <hi>IS there any evil in the City,</hi> and <hi>I have not done it?</hi> (ſaith God by his prophet <hi>Amos.</hi>) The interrogation is an undoubted <hi>Negation; Vain man would be wiſe, though</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi> ch. 11.12.) <hi>he be born like a wild Aſſes colt.</hi> Hence it employeth it ſelf in traducing the equal ways of God, as if they were unequal. Hence he ſaith how can that God who is infinite in goodneſs, be the Author of evil? <hi>Is it good for him to oppreſs, to deſpiſe the work of his hands?</hi> Job 10.2. In my laſt diſcourſe I ſhewed you that it was conſiſtent enough with the goodneſs of God to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the evil of puniſhment. We look upon a ſtaff in the water, and it appeareth to us crooked, when the fault is not in our ſtaff, but only in the weakneſs and imperfection of our ſight, and the unquietneſs of the water; pull the ſtaff out of the water, and look upon it by a due <hi>medium,</hi> and that is ſtraight. We look upon things with blood ſhotten Eyes, and they appear of ſtrange colours but when our Eyes are rectified, then we ſee them in their true and native colours. We look upon a ſtar at a diſtance, and it appears to us as a ſpark, or a very ſmall body of light, when indeed it is a great Globe; we ſee a little man ſtanding by a Dwarf, or Pigmy, he appeares of a great ſtature to us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the little body from him, and then you ſee his true dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Gods ways of Providence, as apprehended by our imperfect and weak reaſon, are ſeen like a ſtaff in the water.</hi> The ways of God are right ways, but we have a very imperfect faculty of arguing, judging, and concluding; and can ſee them no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:192227:283"/>than our lapſed reaſon repreſents; this makes us call them crooked.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our hearts are alſo <hi>vitiated,</hi> and blood-ſhotten, with <hi>luſt, prejudice</hi> and <hi>paſſion,</hi> and this makes the ways of God appear to us in ſtrange colours; when once a Chriſtian hath cleared his <hi>Eye-ſight</hi> with Gods <hi>Eye-ſalve,</hi> then he ſeeth them as they are; and having quitted himſelf of luſt and prejudice, he findeth no difficulty to conclude them <hi>holy, juſt,</hi> and <hi>good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The wiſdom of God in the ways of his Providence, is like the Sun or Moon in the firmament, which are vaſtly great bodies, but appear to us but ſmall Globes, and full of ſpots, by reaſon of our diſtance from them. <hi>Who can by ſearching find out God? who can find out the Almighty to perfection? it is as high as Heaven, what canſt thou do? deeper then Hell, what canſt thou know? the meaſure thereof is broader then the Earth, and longer then the Sea,</hi> Job 11.7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We look upon the great God <hi>in his ways, and motions of his Providence, as ſtanding by our reaſon,</hi> and <hi>fancy,</hi> and compare his wiſdom with ours, meaſuring the Divine reaſon and actions, by our yard-wand, and the wiſdom of God ſeems to us a deformed crooked thing, but let our natural reaſon be rectified, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limated, and once Sanctified by Divine grace; let our minds be enlightened by the Spirit of God, and we ſhall then ſee things clearly as they are. Theſe are the general cauſes of mens misjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and miſapprehenſions concerning the Equity of Gods ways. But let God be true, and every man a lyar: let him be holy, and let what will become of mans reaſon and judgment. It is bad Logick, but it may be good Divinity ſometimes, to hold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, when we cannot deny the premiſes which ſeem to argue againſt it. There goeth a ſtory of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> that being once preſſed by <hi>Eccius</hi> the <hi>Papiſt</hi> with an argument, to which he had not an anſwer ready, he took time, and ſaid, <hi>Cras Reſpondebo;</hi> that he would the next day give anſwer to it. It may be a Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian may ſometimes be put hard to it in his thoughts to ſolve all the <hi>Phaenomena's.</hi> Which a ſubtle Sophiſter will make appear upon the ways and motions of Divine Providence, but in this caſe let him hold to the concluſion, and ſay I am ſure the <hi>Judg of the whole Earth cannot do unjuſtly;</hi> however it be, <hi>God is holy,</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> I will ſtudy an anſwer to this Objection. <hi>Socinus</hi> ſome where ſaith, that if he ſhould meet with any thing in Scripture
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:192227:283"/>which were contrary to his reaſon, he would not believe it to be the ſenſe of Scripture. Proud man! Muſt he think to meaſure infinite wiſdom with his bucket, and to ſcoop out the Ocean of wiſdom that is in God, with his ſpoon? How much better had it been ſaid I believe what God hath ſaid, and I will ſtudy to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile it to my reaſon if I cannot do it, I will rather deny my own reaſon than the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Divine will and wiſdom. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> I think was in the right when he would have the Chriſtian ſay, <hi>Tu Ratio ſtulta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es, audi verbum Dei &amp; tace:</hi> Thou, reaſon, art a fool, hear the word of God, and hold thy peace. But to proceed yet further in my diſcourſe. You have heard it is not inconſiſtent with the purity, and holineſs of the Divine being to be the Author of evil of puniſhment. Becauſe evils of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are indeed no evils, only ſo miſcalled by us. They are great goods to the people of God. But once more <hi>vain man that would be wiſe,</hi> the man of reaſon that thinks he can ſhew us a mote in the Sun, or a crooked angle in the ſtraight lines of Divine wiſdom, comes forth and ſaith.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Suppoſing it conſiſtent with the purity, holineſs, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, to bring evils of puniſhment upon men, who he knows will be made better by them, and be helped by thoſe little Hells to eſcape greater, and by much tribulation be fitted for the Kingdom of God; yet what is this to thoſe whom God knows will never be made better, never be made conformable to the image of his Son.</hi> If theſe evils of puniſhment, are <hi>true</hi> and <hi>perfect evils how can an holy God be the Author of them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I anſwer. We muſt grant, that there are ſome ſtones in the Earth, that no hewing will fit to make <hi>pillars for the houſe of God.</hi> God by his Providence may knock them in pieces, and by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons break them, but <hi>afflictions</hi> and troubles ſhall never mend them: and indeed this is an ordinary obſervation, as <hi>Fire</hi> ſoftneth wax, but <hi>hardneth clay,</hi> ſo affliction which often makes the people of God better, ordinarily make wicked men worſe, they come out of the fire worfe than they went in, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was ſuch a one, ten plagues one after another, wrought no change in his heart but for the worſe, he was more hardned than he was before, <hi>Ahaz</hi> was ſuch another, who when he was afflicted, yet did more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly; the Scripture ſets a brand upon him for it. <hi>This is that King</hi> Ahaz, and we have too too many inſtances of ſuch in the age, and generation in which we live.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="520" facs="tcp:192227:284"/>2. Again, what if ſome be afflicted, who grow worſe, and get no good by their Afflictions, yet may not God uſe means that have <hi>a rational tendency to their good?</hi> Trouble and Affliction is the voice of God unto the worſt of men, crying to them for repentance and reformation; they will not <hi>hear the rod,</hi> muſt not therefore God uſe it? Or doth it not ſpeak when he uſeth it? What if God knoweth that affliction will do them no good, but give them occaſion further to harden their hearts; is God bound by his Providence to act according to his own Omniſciency or counſel? God deals with men who are reaſonable creatures in a reaſonable way, one while perſwading and exhorting, another while chaſtiſing and corecting; ſhall not God by his Miniſters perſwade all men to repent, and to believe, becauſe he knoweth from Eternity who will or will not obey thoſe precepts? Shall not God by his rod teach men to repent and believe, becauſe he hath determined not to give ſpecial grace to all? certainly it is but reaſonable, that God ſhould allow them reaſonable means in order to what he requireth of them, though he knoweth they will make no uſe of them; in their not doing ſo, they at leaſt render themſelves inexcuſable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Queſtion proceedeth upon a grand miſtake, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>all puniſhment</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for the <hi>amendment of the perſon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;</hi> and that if ſuch an end cannot be propounded, or ſhall not be obtained, Puniſhments are things not reconcilable to the holineſs and goodneſs of God. This now is a very great miſtake, and not only contrary to Divinity, but to the reaſon of human Policy. It will the more Illuſtrate this matter, and make the way of God in this appear more eaſy and plain, if I ſhew you,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>all men agree, that the amendment of the offender,</hi> is not the only <hi>end of puniſhment,</hi> but there are other ends for which the <hi>wiſdom of man</hi> judgeth <hi>puniſhments neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That as to God <hi>Reaſon</hi> holds <hi>much more, and the Scripture hath revealed other ends which he aimeth at in puniſhment, than the amendment of the perſon offending, which are highly conſiſtent with his holineſs and juſtice. Seneca,</hi> a great <hi>(Pagan)</hi> Philoſopher, mentions three ends in puniſhments. 1. <hi>The amendment of the perſon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending.</hi> 2. <hi>The ſecurity of others who may be in danger by his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſinful courſes.</hi> 3. <hi>The amendment of others.</hi> It is true there is a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> the end of which is only the amendment of the
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:192227:284"/>perſon offending. Thus Parents puniſh their Children, Maſters their Scholars and Servants: to this purpoſe Magiſtrates uſe whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, brandings, houſes of corrections, goals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe kinds of puniſhments cannot reach unto death; becauſe there can be no amendment of a perſon after the determination of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is true, <hi>ſinners</hi> by being cut off ſometimes, are ſtopt from further ſinning; but properly, none can be ſaid to be made better by being put to death; and if there were no other end of puniſhments dictated by humane reaſon, than the amendment of the perſon offending, humane Laws could ordain no capital puniſhments: But the wiſdom of the Politicians of the world, we ſee hath ordained capital puniſhments for ſome <hi>offences,</hi> and ſome offenders; yea, and degrees of torment in death, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the degree of the offence. Amongſt us, in caſe of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Malefactors are <hi>hang'd, drawn</hi> and <hi>quartered;</hi> in caſe of <hi>murther,</hi> and other Felonies, they are beheaded, hanged, burnt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we ſhall find this wiſdom of men juſtified by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Wiſdom of God, who ordained capital puniſhments for divers offences, as you read in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Although therefore the amendment of the <hi>offender</hi> be one great end of puniſhments, for as much as deliberate, and ordinary acts of naughtineſs, beget in us a further proneneſs and inclination to them, and beget ill habits in us; puniſhments are ordained, the ſmart of which, may wean us from the pleaſure which ariſeth to us from ſinful acts: but though this be one, and that a great end of puniſhment; yet it is not the only end for which the wiſdom of man teacheth him to make uſe of them. There are others, ſuch as are, <hi>The vindication of the authority of the ſuperior from contempt,</hi> the amendment of others, the <hi>ſecurity</hi> of others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is indeed true, That man not being his own end, can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing rightly, but what he doth for ſome good out of himſelf; there muſt be ſomething out of himſelf, for which he acteth, and that ſomething muſt be good, or his action will be evil and bad: But it is not neceſſary, that this <hi>good</hi> which he makes his end in puniſhment, ſhould be the amendment and reformation of the party puniſhed: If it were, he could never puniſh with capital puniſhment. Beſides, there is a <hi>twofold greater good</hi> than this, which he may aim at. 1. The <hi>glory of God,</hi> and the vindication of the Divine Majeſty. 2. The <hi>good either</hi> of <hi>the whole body of the political ſociety, with which he is betruſted, or ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let me ſhew you, that as to <hi>puniſhments inflicted by God,</hi> Reaſon holdeth much more; and as the Scripture revealeth, ſo Reaſon juſtifieth other ends which he both propoſeth, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in the puniſhment of ſinners, to whom affliction doth no good in order to their amendment and reformation. Let me a little open this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Grotius de jure belli.</hi> l. 2.</note> It is truly ſaid by a learned Author, That <hi>Gods actions may be right, though they have no other end beyond themſelves.</hi> Mans cannot be ſo, he muſt act for ſome end, ſome good end, and that muſt be out of himſelf; but the caſe is otherwiſe as to God; he is his own end, and may punniſh a ſinner for no other end than that he may be <hi>revenged</hi> upon him. <hi>He hath made the wicked for the day of wrath,</hi> Prov. 16.4. and ſaith that Author, The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declaring, that God takes a pleaſure in his vengeance upon ſinners, that he will <hi>mock at their calamity,</hi> and <hi>laugh when their fear cometh:</hi> as alſo the laſt judgment, are all evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of this. Now, ſuppoſing this to be true, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent enough, that Gods bringing evil and trouble upon ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, concerning whom, he knoweth that they will never be amended by their troubles, but made worſe; is reconcilable enough to the purity, holineſs, and juſtice of God. <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>get me glory upon Pharaoh.</hi> I told you in my laſt Exerciſe, that if there were no other <hi>good</hi> that came from evils of puniſhment, than the predication and magnification of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and holineſs of God; yet that were enough to warrant the entituling of God to be the efficient cauſe and Author of them: The making of Gods Power and Juſtice known, the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of his Soveraignty and Holineſs, is a noble effect of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence. Now, where God doth not obtain the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and amendment of the ſinner, yet he obtaineth this, he gets himſelf glory upon the poor wretch which actively refuſed to give him glory. Divines and Philoſophers too truly ſay, That in puniſhments, <hi>Reſpicitur, aut utilitas ejus qui peccavit, cujus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tererat peccatum non eſſe, aut indiſtincte quorum libet;</hi> that is, there is always a regard had, either <hi>to the good of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:192227:286"/>or to the good of ſome others,</hi> whoſe intereſt it had been not to have had the offence committed. Suppoſing God not always in puniſhments, to have a reſpect to the good, and amendment of the ſinner that is puniſhed, which is moſt certainly true, as to the puniſhment; yet he hath reſpect unto another, and that a far greater good, the glory of his own great name. Now certainly, it is conſiſtent enough with the holineſs, juſtice, and goodneſs of God, to act for the glory of his name, though it be to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and ruine of his creature; conſidering that it is ſuch a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as by his rebellions hath reproached the Sovereignty of his maker: but this is but one <hi>good</hi> which God obtaineth by thoſe puniſhments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, God by the <hi>puniſhment of ſinners,</hi> though he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not their amendment and reformation, obtaineth yet another more <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal good;</hi> and that two ways. 1. In the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and <hi>preventing at leaſt the wickedneſs of others.</hi> 2. In the <hi>upholding of the government and diſcipline of the world.</hi> This is one end of puniſhment by mens Laws; therefore are ſome male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors hang'd up in chains by the way-ſide, that all who paſs by, may take notice, and be afraid of <hi>committing ſuch wickedneſs.</hi> God by puniſhing and troubling ſinners, ſtrikes a terror into the hearts of others, that if he pleaſeth not to ſanctifie their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to their ſalvation; yet by it much ſin is hindred in the world, from whence his name had been diſhonoured. Yea, and Laſtly, <hi>Government</hi> and diſcipline is in ſome meaſure kept in the world, and Gods <hi>authority</hi> is upheld: Theſe ends now God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in the puniſhment of the vileſt and worſt of men; though it may be they, inſtead of being reformed and amended, do but <hi>blaſpheme,</hi> becauſe of their plagues; yet others ſeeing them, are afraid, and take heed of ſuch courſes. O! what a place of <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and frauds, and beaſtly luſts, and all ſorts of diſorders would the ſordid paſſions of men make the world, were it not for the troubles and afflictions with which God followeth ſome ſinners! for though ſome are to be corrected and reſtrained by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; yet doubtleſs multitudes of people are at leaſt reſtrained by the exemplary vengeance which they ſee God taking upon ſome ſinners, either immediately by his own hand, or by the hands of magiſtrates, who do not bear the Sword in vain, but are <hi>a terror unto evil doers.</hi> Now let us but conſider the great God, as <hi>willing his own glory,</hi> and that in every attribute, that of juſtice, as well
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:192227:287"/>as that of mercy; or conſider God as the great and mighty ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of the world, whoſe intereſt it is to keep up his authority amongſt men, and an aw and reverence of thoſe rules which he hath pleaſed, to preſcribe for the regulation of mens lives: Or as he is a moſt pure and holy God, offended and injured by the ſins of men, whoſe concern it is to reſtrain the exorbitancies of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; or finally as an only wiſe and prudent governor, to whom it belongeth ſo to carry himſelf (obſerving rules of juſtice ſtill) towards individuals, as may beſt conduce to the peace, good, and tranquillity of the whole. I ſay, which way ſoever an intelligent perſon doth conſider God, it appears but an exceeding reaſonable motion of Providence, that he ſhould plague and chaſtiſe ſome ſinners, though he knows they will get no good; but inſtead of being amended, will be made worſe like <hi>Ahaz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Let us obſerve from hence (in the firſt place) <hi>how juſt and reaſonable the ways of Divine Providence are. O houſe of Iſrael</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?</hi> The reaſon of our quarrellings at the motions of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is our weighing them with falſe weights, and a deceitful ballance, or our ſuperficial and perfunctory conſideration of them. The truth is, we do ordinarily accuſe God as inequal in thoſe things, wherein he acteth after the manner of men, whoſe equity yet we never queſtion; we will allow the Potter to have power over the clay, and to make this piece of clay a veſſel of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and that a veſſel of honour; yet we will not allow the Lord of the whole earth, the <hi>Potter</hi> to the whole world of men, who are but ſo many pieces of clay in his hand to do the like: we will allow a ſoveraign Prince a power to kill, and to ſave alive whom he pleaſeth; but we will not allow that Princes maker to have the ſame <hi>jus abſolutum,</hi> the ſame ſoveraign power, though it be granted, that he never executeth it, but upon the demerits of his creature: we can allow an earthly Prince a power to puniſh Wives for the errors of their Husbands, and to diſinherit Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for the treaſons of their Parents; but we think it much to allow a power to God juſtly to puniſh relations for the ſins of their correlates. We can underſtand the juſtice and reaſonableneſs of men in puniſhing ſome malefactors, with ſuch puniſhments, as leave no room for repentance and amendment; but muſt call Gods juſtice, holineſs and goodneſs in queſtion, if he doth but
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:192227:287"/>the ſame thing we do every day. But O you ſons of men! are not the Lords ways equal? Let us learn under tremendous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of vindicative juſtice, to lay our hands upon our mouths, to acknowledg and confeſs the Lords righteouſneſs, and inſtead of diſputing the iſſues of Divine Juſtice, to adore them, and fulfil the Lords ends in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. This in the ſecond place, may ſhew us one <hi>cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the executions of Divine Juſtice, upon miſchievous, and incorrigible ſinners.</hi> The truth is, it ſpeaketh both an ill temper, and worſe Chriſtianity, to rejoyce meerly in the evils that befall the worſt of men. Charity wiſheth well unto all, and obligeth men to mourn with thoſe that mourn. But upon other accounts, the cutting off of ſinners is matter of joy. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.10, <hi>The righteous ſhall rejoyce when he ſeeth the vengeance, and he ſhall waſh his feet in the blood of the wicked.</hi> Gods coming with <hi>vengeance</hi> is made the matter of a promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.4. It hath been made the matter of Gods peoples prayer, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.20. <hi>But, O Lord of hoſts, that judgeſt righteouſly, that trieſt the reins and the heart, let me ſee thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cauſe,</hi> ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.12. And certainly it is alſo matter of praiſe, and thankſgiving, and that upon more accounts than one.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As God, by it, gaineth the glory of his juſtice, and gets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf honour.</hi> Gods glorifying of himſelf, and making his name great, is what the people of God ought continually to rejoyce in. We ſee ſometimes perſons, and parties in the world, opening their mouths againſt Heaven, and bidding a bold defiance to the God that reigneth there, and daring Divine Juſtice a long time; we cannot but ſtand and tremble at it. The patient God at laſt taketh theſe wretches ſo doing, and cuts them off in the midſt of their bold defiances. They have it may be ſome years, as comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their diſcourſe, challenged God to damn them, and the Devil to take them; God at length falleth upon them, teareth them in pieces, makes them to know there is a God in Heaven that judgeth the earth. Now when the righteous man ſeeth this vengeance, he hath reaſon to <hi>rejoyce,</hi> that God hath made known himſelf, vindicated his glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is matter of trouble to them, to ſee any go down into the pit; but it is matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, that by this they are made to know that <hi>there is a God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="526" facs="tcp:192227:288"/>2. As <hi>God by it fulfilleth his word.</hi> All a good Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and hope is laid up in the Scriptures, and he is highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the truth of them; if they be true, he is well enough; if they be not, he hath truſted in a lye. The Scriptures are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full of threatnings of Divine Vengeance againſt impenitent ſinners. Now it is a great temptation to the People of God, to queſtion all the Scripture ſaith, when they read it full of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and revelations of Divine Wrath againſt blaſphemers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecutors, oppreſſors, and bloody men; and yet ſee the world full of ſuch vile miſcreants, and them proſpering, daring God to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and yet having their houſes ſafe from fear. But when they ſee God after ſome months and years of patience, hanging up theſe wretches in chains, cutting them off it may be in the ſtrength of their years; however in their full career of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and miſchief, with their <hi>oaths, curſes,</hi> and <hi>blaſphemies</hi> in their mouths; there they ſee God <hi>fulfilling his word:</hi> and this is matter of joy and rejoycing, though that ſuch ſouls are gone down into the pit, is a lamentation to them, and ſhall be for a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is matter of <hi>joy and thanksgiving,</hi> as they are <hi>ſecured by it from thoſe evils which they felt from thoſe men:</hi> Every good man hath reaſon to be thankful to the judg, for doing juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as are notorious murtherers, high-way men, firers of houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe his life, his goods are by it in a meaſure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. Every good man hath reaſon to rejoyce, and to bleſs God when he cuts off <hi>Sons of violence, men of blood, perſecutors,</hi> &amp;c. as their peace and quiet is by Divine Juſtice ſecured. Who will not ſay, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had reaſon to bleſs God, when he told him, He might now again return into his own Countrey, <hi>for thoſe were dead which ſought the young childs life,</hi> Mat. 2. It is ſaid of the man according to Gods own heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.39. <hi>And when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid heard that Nabal was dead,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord that hath pleaded the cauſe of my reproach from the hand of Nabal.</hi> An Heathen Philoſopher puts miſchievous men in the ſame rank with Foxes and Serpents, and defends mens natural right to deſtroy them. I am ſure it is matter of rejoycing, when God keeps us from private revenge, and lets us ſee his vengeance upon them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again, It is matter of <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>rejoycing, as God by this means upholds the diſcipline and government of the world.</hi> We ought to rejoyce, and to give thanks unto God for all thoſe acts
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:192227:288"/>of his Providence, by which the world is kept in order, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from running into that confuſion, into which the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies of mens luſts and paſſions, and the remiſſion of the reins of government by Magiſtrates, ſometimes would preſently hurry it, if it were not for ſome extraordinary acts of Divine Juſtice, by which God layeth a law upon men, and ſtrikes a terror into them. It is therefore a great miſtake for any to think they may not rejoyce upon occaſion of the ruine and downfall of the Churches Enemies. It is true, in the ruine of others none ought to rejoyce. But in the Vindication of Gods glory upon them, in the deliverance of his people from them, in Gods fulfilling of his word in their deſtruction, in the preſerving and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peace, government, order, and diſcipline of the world, put out of order by them, they ought to rejoyce, and heartily to praiſe God for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. In the third place, <hi>Hath God other ends to be obtained in the puniſhment of wicked men, beſides their amendment and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Let us <hi>endeavour then, that he may obtain them.</hi> That a ſinner by his trouble and afflictions ſhould be amended, reformed, and made better, muſt be the product of his perſonal endeavour, with Gods bleſſing upon it. But for thoſe other ends I mentioned, we may contribute to Gods obtaining of them, when at any time we ſee any ſuch tremendous diſpenſations, as Gods <hi>ſubverting wretches in their heaps of ſin,</hi> making ſome dreadful examples of his vengeance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us firſt give God the glory of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> reflecting upon theſe Attributes of God in our Meditations, ſpeaking of them unto others. Do you ſee God executing vengeance upon ſome ſinners (for he doth not make all examples of his wrath)? but do you ſee him at any time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably puniſhing ſome notorious tranſgreſſors? Be thinking with your ſelves, Oh how righteous a God is our God? who ſhall not fear before him? how true is his word? I have had ſometimes Atheiſtical thoughts, and been ready to think God is not ſo ſevere againſt ſin, as I have heard; or his word is not ſo certain and faithful: but, as I have heard, ſo I now ſee in the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, he hath ſaid, <hi>Blood-thirſty and deceitful men ſhall not live out half their days.</hi> Lo here men of violence, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty, cruel men, perſecutors of the People of God, cut off in
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:192227:289"/>their youth, in the heighth of their rage, and be ſpeaking to your children, to your ſervants, to your friends, of the Juſtice and Truth of God upon ſuch occaſions: you have heard that God doth many times execute vengeance upon finners, that he might get glory upon them; that being they would not actively glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him, he might fetch his glory out of them; and he may be taken notice of in the world as a juſt and righteous God, and as a pure and holy God, of purer eyes than to behold any ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and as a mighty and powerful God, that is able to break in pieces the proudeſt and ſtouteſt rebels, that ſet themſelves in oppoſition to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us <hi>take example</hi> and <hi>warning from the harms of others.</hi> This is one end that man aims at in his puniſhments, to make others afraid of committing the ſame things: and this is one thing which (as you have heard) God aims at. It was Gods command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.11. that thoſe that tempted others to Idolatry, ſhould be ſtoned to death, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10. God in this could not propound the good or reformation of the perſon ſo ſtoned. Well, what doth he then aim at? <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>And all Iſrael ſhall hear, and fear, and do no more any ſuch wickedneſs:</hi> you have the ſame thing in the caſe of the <hi>Rebel,</hi> that ſhould do any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.13. <hi>And all the people ſhall hear and fear, and do no more preſumptuouſly:</hi> you ſee this is one thing God aims at in puniſhing notorious ſinners; and indeed, what he doth moſt generally aim at, where the puniſhment reacheth to death, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if ſudden; for although it be truth, that that God who had mercy upon the theef upon the Croſs, may have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a profligate notorious wretch in the laſt hour, yet there is little hopes of it: but I ſay, in ſuch puniſhments, undoubtedly next to the vindication of his own glory, the great end which God aimeth at, is the terror and affrightment of others, that they may hear, and fear, and do no more wickedly. Let us therefore make it our buſineſs ſo to improve ſuch Providences, that God may have his end upon us, by our hearing, ſeeing, fearing, and avoiding thoſe ſins againſt which we ſee the wrath of God ſo remarkably revealed: Thou ſeeſt in the world debauched drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, filthy adulterers, profane Sabbath-breakers, prodigious blaſphemers, miſchievous <hi>Nimrods,</hi> great hunters, and perſecutors of ſuch as fear God; ſome of them (it may be) young men, ſome with numerous families, others of fair eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> healthy
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:192227:289"/>bodies like enough to have lived in the world many days. On a ſudden with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 73.18. <hi>Thou ſeeſt them caſt into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> brought into a deſtruction, <hi>as in a moment, utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with the Lords terrors;</hi> thou ſeeſt them <hi>written</hi> childleſs, or with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> ſtruck dead; thou ſeeſt them as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 37. ſaw the wicked in great power, and ſpreading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like a green bay-tree; by and by he paſſed away, and lo he was not; thou ſoughteſt him, and he was not found; thou ſeeſt them, their families, their eſtates, conſuming <hi>like the fat of lambs, into ſmoke conſumed away.</hi> This age (if you obſerved it) hath afforded you many ſuch ſights: how many young wretches have you ſeen cut off in the beginning and ſtrength of their years! Knots of <hi>Hectors</hi> (as this age calls them) in whoſe conſtitution nothing could be ſeen, but that they might have out-lived hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of us, and in a few years they are tumbled into their graves: you ſeek for them, and not one of the old brood found. O let all of us <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and take heed of thoſe leud courſes, which God hath in our ſight ſo revenged upon them. It is one end of theſe ſevere puniſhments of God, that others ſhould learn righteouſneſs. Let us by theſe warnings be ſtartled, and take heed of thoſe ſins in which they lived, and which we may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly judg brought this quick vengeance upon them.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. Laſtly, Doth God ſometimes <hi>puniſh ſinners, who he knoweth will but be worſe, not at all amended by his rod:</hi> And is this conſiſtent with his <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Juſtice?</hi> O let <hi>every one of us then that hath been afflicted, or that ſhall fall under the afflicting hand of God in any kind, make it our buſineſs to ſearch what Gods end was in his afflicting us, whether he aimed at our good, or meerly his own glory, and the good of others.</hi> Let me tell you, it will be a very ſad reflexion for us, to reflect upon Gods viſiting us with ſome grievous ſickneſs, or puniſhing us in our eſtates and relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not to be able to ſatisfy our ſelves, that God aimed at more in his bitter Providences, than the getting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf glory upon us, or the bettering of others; for there is none comes out of an affliction, but he comes out better or worſe, more hardned, or with a more ſoftned and tender heart, more holy, or more profane and ſtupid. But you will ſay to me, How ſhall we be able to make up this Judgment? who knows the aims and intendments of a man in action, but the ſpirit of a man that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:192227:290"/>him? and who knows the aims and intendments of God, ſave only God himſelf? I anſwer, <hi>God is never fruſtrated of his end;</hi> man may, as not being able to accompliſh it, God cannot. 'Tis eaſie therefore to know the Counſels of God concerning thee in this caſe by the effects: <hi>Examine therefore what effects hath thy affliction had upon thee.</hi> Wherein art thou more amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? The amendment of a perſon upon the ſad Providences of God lyes much in theſe two things, <hi>Repentance and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 2. <hi>Having a better heart for duty, and being more diligent in the practice of it.</hi> Search and examine thy ſoul then upon theſe two points. Say to thy ſelf, 1. <hi>My ſoul,</hi> thou haſt drank of the waters of <hi>Marah;</hi> God hath dealt bitterly with thee; I have been at the very brink of the grave: I have loſt a fair eſtate, God hath croſt me in my deareſt relations. What ſins have I the more reflected upon for theſe things? wherein have I been more humbled for the mighty hand of God upon me, or mine? what ſin more have I left? am I grown leſs worldly and carnal? what luſt have I got a further victory over? have I a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter command of my paſſions? am I grown meeker? am I more humble? is my ſpirit more broken? do I ſee more of my own vileneſs than I did? have I learned with <hi>Job,</hi> to <hi>abhor my ſelf, and to repent in duſt and aſhes, to lay mine hand upon my mouth?</hi> Or, 2. <hi>Enquire of thy ſoul,</hi> wherein by this affliction, either thy habits of the grace, or practice of piety and godlineſs hath been advantaged; whether thy faith or patience be improved, thy meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humility improved, or any of thoſe habits of grace which uſe to grow under the rod. Enquire of thy ſelf, wherein thou art improved as to the practice of Piety; whether thou haſt ſince thy affliction learned to keep the Lords ſtatutes, to <hi>walk in thy houſe in a more perfect way.</hi> Give me leave to mind you what you ſee every day. It is the ſign of a decaying plant, not to ſhoot forth, and look more green, after a ſhower, much more to wither, and dwindle after it: Afflictions are Gods ſhowres, almoſt all ſorts of people in this Nation, have had great plenty of them within the age we have lived in; the face of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us at this day, gives little evidence, that Gods aim in it, was the amendment and reformation of the perſons under thoſe troubles and afflictions which they have met with; it concerneth us to look to our ſelves. If Gods end was only to try what we would be, to vindicate his own glory, his power, juſtice, and
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:192227:290"/>holineſs upon us, to deter others from the like practices; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good may by our afflictions be occaſioned to God in the vindication of his glory, or to others in their learning righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, it is but a ſad ſymptom of ruin to our ſelves.</p>

                  <p>I Am opening to you the hard Chapters of Divine Providence, <hi>Actual Providence</hi> juſtifying the Lords ways to be equal, even where they appear leſs equal to our ſenſe and reaſon. I am at preſent diſcourſing the Equity of Punitive Providences. I have here ſhewed you how conſiſtent it is with the Juſtice, Holineſs, and Goodneſs of God, to be the <hi>Author of evil to,</hi> though not in the Sons of men; the Author of the Evil of puniſhment, though not of the <hi>evil of ſin.</hi> I have ſhewed you how conſiſtent it is with the Attributes and Perfections of the Divine Nature, to puniſh and trouble his own people, even ſuch as he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of a ſatisfaction for their ſins at the hand of his Son, whoſe iniquities <hi>he hath pardoned,</hi> &amp;c. How conſiſtent it is with the Wiſdom, Juſtice, Holineſs, and Goodneſs of God to puniſh wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, though he knoweth afflictions will do them no good, but make them worſe, hardening their hearts, and giving them occaſion to blaſpheme, becauſe of their plagues. But we do not only ſee adult, and grown perſons ſmitten of God and afflicted, and thoſe as well ſuch as fear God, as thoſe who have no fear of God before their eyes; but we alſo ſee <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſmitten of God,</hi> ſuch of whom we ſay, <hi>They have neither done good nor evil.</hi> The Queſtion is,</p>
                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:192227:291"/>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How this diſpenſation of Actual Providence is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable to the juſtice and goodneſs of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which blindeth our eyes, and maketh this motion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence appear more hard and difficult to be underſtood by us, is the ſuppoſed innocency of children, they periſh oft-times before they come to exerciſe any acts of reaſon. Concerning the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate</hi> of children, dying in their infancy, I ſhall determine nothing, becauſe indeed the Scripture (that I know of) no-where determines all ſo dying within the <hi>election of grace,</hi> nor that Chriſt as to all ſuch hath <hi>expiated the guilt of</hi> Adams <hi>ſin,</hi> or <hi>original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;</hi> nor <hi>that effectual ſaving grace doth always attend the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Baptiſm,</hi> though they be brought under it, which yet many are not. This is a great ſecret what God doth with the ſouls of children dying in infancy. But this is not what I have to do with, what God doth with the ſouls of ſuch we ſee not; we have no ſufficient means to underſtand, and therefore freely leave them to the good pleaſure of God. But we ſee they are afflicted as well as others, they dye as much as others, if not in greater numbers. Shall we ſay the hand of God is not in this thing? Or that their ſickneſſes and deaths are no effects of <hi>punitive Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> or vindicative juſtice, but the meer product of a diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nature and temper? this were certainly to contradict the holy Scriptures, where we find the afflictions of children made the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of threatnings, the executions of puniſhments upon them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to God. God by his Prophet threatned the death of <hi>Davids</hi> child by <hi>Bathſheba;</hi> and of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> child in this Text, ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. The afflictions and troubles of children riſe no more out of the duſt, nor more ſpring out of the ground than others; their <hi>afflictions</hi> come at his command, work at his command, bring forth the iſſues which he willeth them, and are puniſhments as well as the afflictions of more adult and grown perſons. My bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs muſt be to reconcile this motion of Divine Providence, to Divine juſtice and goodneſs. In order to which, I ſhall offer you ſeveral conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Could I aſſure you, that <hi>all children dying in their infancy, are undoubtedly ſaved,</hi> either as being within the decree of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all of them choſen in Chriſt to eternal life before the foundation of the world, or as having their ſhare in the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin expiated by Chriſt, and their original pollution waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:192227:291"/>away in his blood, this queſtion were determined, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of no value. It is a priviledged ſoul that firſt gets out of the priſon of the fleſh into the liberty, the glorious liberty of the ſons of God. Suppoſing this, it would be no act of juſtice and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, but mercy and goodneſs of God, to cut off our children from the womb, and from the breaſts; to deliver them from the bodily pains and aches, from all other vexations, croſſes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances which they ſhall be ſure to meet with in the world; happy, thrice happy is that ſoul certainly that makes but one leap from the womb into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, that takes but one ſtep into the world, and the next into Paradiſe: and certainly this is the caſe of very many; Chriſt hath told us, that of <hi>ſuch is the kingdom of God:</hi> if all ſuch be not there (as to which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is ſilent) yet many ſuch are there, all <hi>choſen in Chriſt are there.</hi> There is good hopes of the <hi>ſeed of thoſe that fear God;</hi> the Covenant of God is with his people, and with their ſeed: and how happy are they that can get to Heaven with a <hi>groan or two,</hi> with ſuch a degree of pain and aches, as thoſe little bodies can only bear, and that before their reaſon is improved by its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, to make their pains and miſeries more bitter. So that as to all ſuch as are ordained unto life, the caſe is plain; Divine goodneſs is eminently ſeen in giving them ſo ſhort a paſſage through the vale of miſery, and ſhewing them a far ſhorter and nearer way to Heaven, than what more grown perſons muſt go, through much tribulation. Now though I cannot aſſure you this concerning all, yet I can concerning many, which makes the day of their afflictions and death to be much better than the day wherein it was ſaid of them, <hi>There is a child born into the world:</hi> and ſurely if the <hi>Thracians</hi> (who were heathens) upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of no more than the miſeries to which humane life is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, could alter the common cuſtom of rejoycing at Nativities, and mourning at Burials, into a mourning at the birth of their children, and a rejoycing and triumphing at the death of their friends; we to whom a <hi>life and immortality is brought to light by the Goſpel,</hi> and to whom the immediate tranſition of elect ſouls out of a ſtate of mortality and miſery, into a ſtate of happineſs and eternal bleſſedneſs, is matter of faith, have much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to adore the goodneſs of God in the preſent determination of our childrens lives, than to quarrel at Divine Providence for bringing ſuch things to paſs, while it doth us, nor ours, any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:192227:292"/>harm than depriving us of the little pleaſure we take in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding thoſe pictures of our ſelves, dandling them in our laps, hugging them in our boſoms, while alſo this pleaſure is embitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by a thouſand fears, and cares, and ſollicitudes, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, for, with, and concerning them. But becauſe I cannot aſſure you this concerning all, ſomething further muſt yet be ſaid to vindicate the juſtice of God in this diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Therefore, I ſay, the <hi>original ſin</hi> of children is enough to juſtifie God in all his <hi>afflictions of Children:</hi> nor is this, that I know, denied by any valuable or conſiderable party. It was indeed the opinion of <hi>Arminius, That no perſon was damned, meerly for original ſin;</hi> but upon what grounds none of his diſciples have been able ever to tell the world, to any ſatisfaction: and it were ſtrange if they ſhould, when the Scripture ſaith expreſly, Epheſ. 2.3. <hi>That we are by nature the children of wrath,</hi> that is, (cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly) heirs of wrath, and expoſed to the wrath of God: and the Apoſtle tells us Rom. 5.18. <hi>That by the offence of one man, judgement came upon all to condemnation.</hi> Now when-as all men were by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin ſubjected to wrath and condemnation, and by their <hi>original ſin,</hi> children of wrath: what ground hath any to aſſert that none ſhall be eternally condemned meerly for <hi>original ſin,</hi> would poſe the thoughts of any intelligent perſon, I think. I do indeed know that ſome tell us, that Chriſt as to all men expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the guilt of <hi>Adams ſin,</hi> ſome add alſo <hi>original ſin;</hi> others tell us that is all waſhed off in Baptiſm. I want one clear Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for any thing of this, but yet <hi>Arminius</hi> never denied (ſo far as I have read him) <hi>that infants have not upon them the guilt of original ſin,</hi> which God may puniſh certainly, if not with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, yet with temporal puniſhments; for even paſt and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſins may be thus puniſhed, as I have before ſhewed you in my Obſervations upon the motions of Actual Providence. Every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant cometh into the world under the guilt of the firſt mans tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion reckoned to him, as he was in the loyns of <hi>Adam,</hi> and under the want of original righteouſneſs, with an innate pravity and corruption of nature, averſe naturally to all that is good; prone and inclined unto that which is evil. Suppoſing now what <hi>Arminius</hi> would have, and can never be proved, that God will eternally condemn none meerly for this ſin; yet ſurely he may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcourge and correct with the utmoſt puniſhments ſhort of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment, even this guilt in children, which have not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:192227:292"/>finned. It was Gods threatning annexed to his Covenant with <hi>Adam; In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye.</hi> Some queſtion how God juſtified it when <hi>Adam</hi> lived to nine hundred and thirty years before he dyed. Divines therefore expound it, by <hi>eris mortalis,</hi> thou ſhalt be ſubject and liable unto death: in the day in which he did eat, he <hi>became mortal;</hi> from that day he began to dye, and was made liable to that change. Every child aſſoon it cometh into the world eateth of this forbidden fruit, I mean, becomes liable to the guilt of its proparents eating, and ſo is liable unto death. It is true, the Lord doth not cut off all children, how then ſhould the world be repleniſhed and ſtand, but yet he cutteth off ſome for the declaration of his juſtice: as a Prince, when a whole City or Province is in a rebellion, he will not cut them off all, becauſe he will not waſte and depopulate a Country; but he will cut off ſome for the declaration of his juſtice. Thus you ſee this motion of Providence is eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable to the juſtice of God upon this hypotheſis, that <hi>children are ſinners,</hi> and under an original guilt: and if we could be ſo confident, as ſome are, that none ſhall be damned for that ſin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or that it is expiated on the behalf of all, or waſhed away in Baptiſm, as to all born within the pale of the Church: Yet nothing hinders but by the ſame juſtice by which God puniſheth paſt and pardoned ſins, (which I have formerly at large opened to you) God might yet juſtly trouble and afflict little ones: they might be ſick, and they might dye, as <hi>Jeroboams</hi> child men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Text did; though <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. ſaith of him expreſly, <hi>That there was ſome good thing found in him, towards the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> Let this be a ſecond conſideration to ſatisfie you as to the righteouſneſs of God in theſe diſpenſations. But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed yet further.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This motion of Providence ſeemeth very reaſonable, and competent to the wiſdom of God. <hi>That he might declare to the world, that he is that God in whom all breath,</hi> he in whom they live, they move and have their being. If we ſhould ſee none dye but in an old age, we ſhould be ready to think, that our candle never went out but for want of oyl; and ſhould not underſtand how much we were beholden to God for every hour of life: how much we depended upon him for our daily breath, as well as for daily bread. Now it is but reaſonable, that the world ſhould underſtand God to be the <hi>fountain of life;</hi> that ſickneſs
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:192227:293"/>and death do not meerly depend upon ſecond cauſes; but there is a firſt cauſe, that is the efficient, the principal efficient cauſe of theſe changes, though he uſeth a variety of ſecond cauſes: he will therefore ſuffer irregular motions of humours in children, which ſhall in them cauſe ſickneſſes and death, though they never were ſurfeited with meats, nor Inflamed with drinks. He bloweth out Candles newly lighted, to let us know, that <hi>the iſſues of life and death are in his hand,</hi> and that the breath of man is not meerly in his own noſtrils; and it is but reaſonable that God ſhould make himſelf thus known to us as the God of our lives.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again, this diſpenſation of Providence is <hi>reconcileable to the goodneſs of God.</hi> God by this means doth <hi>deliver little ones from the evil to come.</hi> This is the very caſe in the Text, God was bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil upon the houſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> as he threatneth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11, 12. he intended to <hi>take away the remnant of the houſe of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung from the earth. Abijah</hi> falls ſick and dies, and this out of mercy to him that his eyes might not ſee, nor he have any ſhare in the evil which God was about to bring upon his Fathers houſe. God gathereth up the Lambs before the ſtorm cometh. It is ſaid of <hi>Babilon,</hi> Pſal. 137. <hi>That he ſhould be happy, that ſhould take their little ones and daſh them againſt the ſtones:</hi> and we read in Scripture of ſuch famines as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced women to eat their own children. Now God often cuts off little ones in his mercy to them. I might here further add, that God by this diſpenſation preventeth much ſin in thoſe that are thus taken away: But I paſs on yet to ſome further conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, clearing Gods juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is but reaſonable that God ſhould do this <hi>to puniſh the ſins of the Parents, and to do them good.</hi> It was one of my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations concerning the motions of <hi>Actual Providence.</hi> That God doth very ordinarily puniſh Relations in their Correlates, Parents in their Children; and I ſhewed you the reaſonableneſs of Divine Providence in this motion. It was for the puniſhment of <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, that his child by <hi>Bathſheba died;</hi> and the death of it was threatned by <hi>Nathan</hi> as a part of <hi>Davids</hi> puniſhment, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. Poſſibly God may ſometimes do it to abate our affections to our children, and that he might have more of our heart and affections; as the Gardiner cutteth off the ſuckers which draw too much from the root; and the country Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife takes away the Calf when it ſucketh ſo much as it leaveth no milk for the pail.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="537" facs="tcp:192227:293"/>6. <hi>Finally,</hi> Why may not this motion of Providence ſeem rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, <hi>That room might be left in the world.</hi> The world is a great Theatre, in which he hath many to act their parts: God at firſt lengthned out the lives of the Patriarchs to ſeven, eight, nine hundred years, that the world might be repleniſhed with Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. He now ſhortneth the lives of thoſe that are born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, that the world might not be overburdened with Inhabitants. More might be added. By the death and ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of little ones, all are warned to be continually upon their watch, not knowing when the Lord will call for them; every little Bell that telleth us a child is gone ſoundeth to us, would we but underſtand it, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come.</hi> Further yet, God by this diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (in which as you have heard he is juſt) doth mind all of the duty they owe unto their children, to bring them up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures, in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; and particularly not to defer the ordinance of Baptiſm beyond a reaſonable time. It is doubtleſs Gods ordinance as to children, not only a ſign of Gods Covenant, but a <hi>medium</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſalvation, though efficacious only when God is pleaſed to make it ſo, not <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> upon the work done. I have now ſhewed you the equity of God in this particular way of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It is a diſpenſation under which there are few Parents that are not brought. Let me therefore enlarge a little upon ſome practical Application of this Diſcourſe, ſhewing you what may be our duty, reaſonably concluded from this diſpenſation. I ſhall open to you ſomething of it in three or four particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is doubtleſs our duty, yea the duty of all fleſh, <hi>To be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent before the Lord under ſuch Providences.</hi> The loſs of a child, eſpecially if it be a <hi>firſt-born,</hi> or an only child, ſometimes goeth very near us. But oh, let us not be tempted from it to open our mouths againſt the God of Heaven, nor to entertain a thought in our ſouls derogatory to the juſtice and goodneſs of God. Our children are ſinners, and obnoxious to the juſtice of God; God may in juſtice puniſh them for their own ſins, or for our ſins: I hinted to you before, that it was a beam of <hi>Arminius</hi> his new light, <hi>that none ſhould be condemned for original ſin only;</hi> and he is followed in it by all the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> in their Confeſſions, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:192227:294"/>as alſo by others of that tribe: <hi>Socinus</hi> alſo and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers ſhake hands with them in that notion. Yet <hi>Arminins</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> (who to diſprove <hi>Arminius</hi> his doctrine of Gods rejection of any, becauſe he foreſaw they would reject the grace of the Goſpel) had pinched him, telling him this could be no cauſe of the rejection of infants out of the pale of the Church. God could not foreſee they would reject the Goſpel, who he foreſaw ſhould never have the Goſpel preached or tendred to them, anſwereth him thus, <hi>At inquam ego in parentibus, abavis, avis, atavis, tritavis evangelii gratiam repudiarunt, quo actu meru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt ut a Deo deſerantur.</hi> That is, But I ſay (ſaith he) they rejected the Goſpel in their Parents, their Grandfathers, their great Grandfathers, or former Progenitors. Now how this is conſiſtent with his other doctrine, I cannot underſtand: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if God may be juſtified in rejecting the ſouls of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants from eternity, becauſe he foreſaw that their Great-Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers would reject and refuſe the Goſpel, when-as they by no perſonal act ſhould do any ſuch thing; he may be juſtified even in the eternal condemnation of children for the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> or the perſonal obliquity and corruption of their natures; and ſo it is not unrighteous with God eternally to condemn a child for its original corruption only. But we are not now ſpeaking of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condemnation, but of bodily and temporal; yea and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary puniſhments, which may very well conſiſt with the eternal ſalvation of the ſoul: and it is very abſurd for us to think, that for ſuch puniſhments the infant may not be puniſhed (without the impeaching of the juſtice of God) though it hath been guilty of no actual ſin, deſerving ſo early a chaſtiſement of it. Oh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffer not in ſuch caſes your hearts or lips to tranſgreſs, God may do it in righteouſneſs. He may thus juſtly puniſh original ſin in the child; he may juſtly puniſh our ſins upon the backs of our children. Speak not a word againſt God in this Providence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Do what in thee lyeth ſecondly to find out the cauſe.</hi> When the <hi>Jews</hi> queried our Saviour concerning the man that was born blind, for <hi>whoſe ſin it was, whether his, or his parents?</hi> Our Saviour anſwereth them, that it was neither for his ſin, nor yet for his Parents, but that the glory of God might appear in that famous miracle, which our Saviour wrought in reſtoring him to his ſight. It is an hard thing to find out Gods ends in his diſpenſations of punitive Providence; God may ſometimes afflict, and take away
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:192227:294"/>little ones for their own ſins, for the ſin of <hi>Adam;</hi> for the iniquity in which they were conceived, and the ſin in which they were brought forth. God may ſometimes do it for the <hi>Parents ſins.</hi> Sometimes he may do it principally neither for the one, nor for the other of theſe ends, but for the good of the Parents, or for the good of the Children: you have heard that this motion of Divine Providence, is highly reaſonable upon more then one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But yet when we feel the ſmart of ſuch a diſpenſation, we know not how to look upon it otherwiſe than as a puniſhment; but now our buſineſs under ſuch providences is to enquire, what ſin in us God doth in that manner revenge. The Scripture will guide us a little in the finding out of this, and we may poſſibly find out ſome other helps, to make us underſtand theſe diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. It was threatned to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. For his ſins in the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> and his wife, and for that by them <hi>he had given occaſion to the enemies of God to blaſpheme.</hi> It is one of thoſe common ſcourges with which God chaſtiſeth ſome Parents for their ſinful lives; and whoſo is conſcious to himſelf of a ſinful courſe of life, need not enquire much for what cauſe God brings him under ſuch diſpenſations. It is matter of more narrow enquiry why God thus chaſteneth his own people. Poſſibly if they will ſearch narrowly under ſuch a Providence, they may find, if not the very ſin for which God contendeth with them, yet ſome laps of their lives of that nature, as may give them a juſt ground of jealouſy and ſuſpicion, that that is the ſin for which God ſo troubleth them. I ſhall not be poſitive in this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation leſt, I ſeem too boldly to inquire into the ſecret counſels of God: men ſhould do well under theſe Providences to liſten to their own conſciences, which oft times tell them the truth in ſuch caſes. But let me ask of thee, or rather deſire thee to ask thy ſelf, theſe two or three following Queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Didſt thou never ſinfully diſtruſt the Providence of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Children;</hi> And ſecretly repine, at Gods bounty to thee in them? this is now a temptation incident to ſuch as are of meaner condition in the world, and not ſo able as others to maintain their Families. God promiſeth the fruit of the womb as a bleſſing; and bleſſeth him, that hath his quiver full of theſe ſhafts, but now the poor man, knoweth not how to underſtand this; and it is hard for him not to repine at the multiplying of it: a great error doubtleſs, but ſuch as for ought I know good people may
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:192227:295"/>fall into; we cannot truſt God to provide for thoſe which he giveth us, if this hath been thy error, God but pays thee in thy own kind, by ſhortning thy number, and maketh thy own ſecret, ſinful wiſh now to be thy Plague and Torment; but this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily is the ſin of the poorer and meaner ſort of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Didſt thou not let thy heart run out too much upon thy Children?</hi> God is jealous, and it is the nature of jealouſy not to ſuffer a rival in the object beloved, be it a perſon, or a thing. God is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and he will be the prime object of his peoples love, deſire, and delight, It is his Law. <hi>Thou ſhall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy ſtrength;</hi> it may be thy Child had more of thy heart, more of thy love and and delight than God had, no wonder if he hath taken it from thee: this is now uſually the ſin of thoſe whoſe circumſtances in the world are better, they have a fair eſtate in the world, and Children few enough to leave it to, and in ſuch caſes it is a very hard thing to keep our hearts within due bounds; but our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are ready to overflow, eſpecially if there be nothing in the temper, or behaviour of the Child, that takes off the edge of our affections to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Doth not thy heart ſmite thee for the neglect <hi>of thy duty to thy Child,</hi> eſpecially if it were of any years? Thy duty in inſtructing it, or thy duty in reproving and admoniſhing it. <hi>Elie's</hi> Sons were indeed men grown, but God cut off his Children; though their perſonal guilt juſtified God in his ſeverity againſt them, yet <hi>Eli</hi> ſmarted in their puniſhments for honouring his Sons more than God, for dealing too gently with them for their moſt enormous wickedneſſes. Thou mayeſt alſo neglect thy duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in inſtructing them, in making them acquainted with the holy Scriptures; in admoniſhing them to keep the Lords Sabbaths, and ſeeing to their external Sanctification of them. This is undoubtedly a ſecond piece of thy duty upon ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and to be humbled before God for thoſe ſins which thy conſcience ſmiteth thee for, and ſuggeſteth to thee as probable cauſes of this rod of God upon thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is doubtleſs thy duty, whatſoever thou findeſt, to be <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Gods good pleaſure.</hi> Rachel <hi>mourned ſinfully while ſhe</hi> ſo mourned as <hi>that ſhe refuſed to be comforted.</hi> If thou findeſt that probably God hath puniſhed thy ſin, in the ſickneſs, pain, and
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:192227:295"/>death of thy Child, it is indeed matter of humiliation to thee; it offers thee a juſt opportunity to reſolve for the time to come, to amend thy errors as to any ſurvivors which God ſhall lend thee: but yeſterday cannot be called back again, God hath done what pleaſed him. It may be in mercy to thy Child, though it be in judgment unto thee, thou haſt no reaſon to quarrel or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at God for any of his diſpenſations. If it be for thy Childs <hi>Original ſin,</hi> ſtill thou haſt no reaſon to blame God, he is juſt and righteous in what he hath done. But if God hath done it to give thy Child a quicker paſſage to Heaven, to bring it ſooner to a ſtate of perfection, to deliver it from an evil to come, here thou haſt reaſon to admire, and adore the Divine goodneſs rather than to quarrel at Divine Juſtice. There are a great many things that may conduce to the relief of a godly man or woman diſturbed at this diſpenſation of Divine Providence. It is a very ordinary diſpenſation of God; though therefore it may look like a digreſſion from the principal argument of my diſcourſe, yet it may poſſibly be not ſo judged by ſome of you, whoſe caſe it either at preſent is, or may be to inſtance in ſome heads of arguments, which occaſionally you may make uſe of, for the quieting of your Spirits.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſider, what-ever was the moving cauſe on Gods part, yet the will of God is revealed.</hi> The will of God is ſuch a thing to ſatisfy a Chriſtian with, as nothing can be more, nothing greater. We have our <hi>Heaven by the will of God fear not little flock, it is your Fathers will to give you a Kingdom.</hi> We have all our grace, all our glory from the will of God, and ſhall we not thankfully accept a croſs, when it is the will of our Father to lay it upon our necks? We pray <hi>thy will be done,</hi> and ſhall we murmure againſt it when we ſee it done. This ſilenced <hi>Aaron, David, Heli, Hezekiah,</hi> it leaves no room for a good Chriſtians reply to it, it is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, that is enough. It is our Fathers will revealed by an Act of his Providence. <hi>The Lord hath given</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Job) <hi>and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider how many ſadder caſes than thine there have been.</hi> Thou haſt loſt a Child, an infant; <hi>Job</hi> loſt all his Children when they were grown up, feaſting at their elder Brothers houſe. <hi>Aarons</hi> was a ſad cauſe, he loſt his two Sons grown up, in an act of ſinning, yet he held his peace. <hi>Helies</hi> caſe was ſad, to loſe two ſuch wicked Sons in a Battel. <hi>Davids</hi> caſe was ſad, God
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:192227:296"/>had expreſly told him <hi>the Child ſhould dye, becauſe of his ſin;</hi> and that by it, he had made the enemies of God to blaſpheme. What doth <hi>David</hi> do? He faſteth, he prayeth, he humbleth himſelf before God ſo long as the Child lived, and while he had any hope; but when the will of God was revealed, when the Child was dead, he ariſeth, and eateth bread as he was wont to do, he ſaith, that he ſhould go to it, it ſhould not return to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider, <hi>Let the caſe be as ſad as it will, yet if thou lookeſt round about it, there is mercy in it;</hi> either mercy to thy Child, or mercy to thee, or mercy to both: if thy Child be gone to Heaven, there is mercy in that; if it be delivered from evil to come upon the World, or that part of the world where it ſhould have had its portion, there is mercy in that. <hi>David</hi>'s caſe was as ſad as one can well think of any of this nature; yet there was this mercy in it, the living monument and remembrance of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s ſin and ſhame was taken away.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Suppoſe that <hi>God hath for thy ſin taken it away,</hi> and thou canſt not ſatisfie thy ſelf but it is ſo; yet conſider, <hi>God eternally puniſheth none for the ſins of their correlates.</hi> God may puniſh perſons with bodily and temporal puniſhments for the ſins of their Parents, but not eternally; as to thoſe puniſhments, every ſoul ſhall bear no more than its own iniquity. <hi>Arminius</hi> I remember telleth us, that he can ſee no reaſon, but that Children may be equally puniſhed eternally for the ſins of their Parents, as well as the whole poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> for his ſin: but certainly there is a vaſt difference; the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was a <hi>publick perſon,</hi> with whom God made a Covenant for life or death for himſelf, and for his poſterity; and he had a power as well to have conveyed life as death to all his poſterity: but ſurely none will aſſert this, as to any Parent ſince his time.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider <hi>how much comfort there is laid for parents mourning,</hi> in that ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>for of ſuch is the kingdom of God.</hi> Men that have large Gardens and Orchards, have places for ſlips and Inlays, as well as for old Stocks; Nurſeries for Plants, as well as places for full-grown fruit-trees. God hath his <hi>garden of Grace</hi> (that is, his Church) and he hath his <hi>garden of Glory,</hi> to both belong Nurſeries. The Children of believers are (though imperfect members) yet members of his Church; and they may be heirs of Glory, though they go out of this world under age, as to any earthly inheritance: Yet they may be of full age for the
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:192227:296"/>inheritance that is immortal, incorruptible, and which fadeth not away; they will be of age in that Country where is no infant of days, nor old man of years. The poſſibility of little Childrens entering into the Kingdom of God, yea the probability that the ſeed of ſuch as fear God, dying in infancy are ſo entred, ought to be a wonderful relief to Godly parents mourning upon this account. Some Mothers only people the earth with ſinners; God puts an honour upon thee if thou ſtockeſt Heaven with Saints, and bringeſt forth to the kingdom of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider, <hi>Thou canſt never loſe a Child with more hope than in its infancy.</hi> Some have thought that the death of Chriſt hath as to all expiated the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; both the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> ſeem ſo to judge. Others think, that by vertue of the New Covenant, the <hi>water of Baptiſm</hi> waſheth away <hi>original ſin. Auguſtine</hi> was called <hi>Durus pater infantum,</hi> an hard Father to Infants, becauſe he thought all unbaptized Infants were damned; by which it ſeems, he deferred much to Baptiſm: but I do not remember that I ever read in him, or heard from him, that he held, that <hi>all baptized Infants ſhould be ſaved, if dying in infancy.</hi> I durſt not fix the comfort of mourning Parents upon theſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations: But yet this is certain, the Infant within the pale of the Church, the Child of the believing, the true believing Parent eſpecially, is in Covenant with God: It hath not yet been defiled with wilfull preſumptuous ſinning; we cannot ſay ſo of our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they are grown up to years. A godly Parent can never loſe a Child with more hopes of its eternal Salvation, than in its infancy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Again, Poſſibly what God hath done, he hath done in <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to thee, to thy ſoul,</hi> that thy affections may be more entirely upon him. God knew thy heart better than thy ſelf; it may be, by ſuch a ſtroke he hath ſecured thy heart more unto himſelf, it may be in mercy as to the comforts of thy life. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> could better have followed his Children in their infancy to their grave, than have ſeen them ſlain by a barbarous enemy before his face. Thou knoweſt not what evil is coming upon the world.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Laſtly conſider, That for thoſe <hi>that keep the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and chuſe the things that pleaſe him, and take hold of the Lords Covenant,</hi> God hath, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.45, promiſed <hi>a better name than that of ſons, and daughters, even an everlaſting name which ſhall never be cut off.</hi> But I ſhall digreſs no further on this Argument.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="544" facs="tcp:192227:297"/>4. Laſtly, Having ſtilled thy impatience, what haſt thou to do, but to <hi>fulfil the Lords will and ends under ſuch a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Let thoſe do it that are patients under ſuch providences. Let us all do it, who are ſpectators of them.</p>
                  <p>Are any of us patients under ſuch Providences, let us fulfil the Lords ends in them. You will ſay, what are they? I Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Submiſſion to his good will,</hi> is doubtleſs one thing. God by all afflictions of his people, deſigneth to <hi>humble,</hi> and <hi>to prove his people, that he may do them good in the latter end.</hi> Such diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the rod of God upon us, and his rod hath a voice, and we are bound to <hi>hear his rod.</hi> God is now trying thy <hi>obedience; Abraham</hi>'s trial, was a greater trial: he had but one Child, him a Son, the Child of the promiſe, God required him to kill him with his own hand, he ſubmitted, and the Lord accepted his will for the deed. Thy hearing the voice of one rod, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Lords taking of another to ſcourge thee with.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Humiliation for thoſe ſins which thou ſuſpecteſt to have been the provoking cauſe of ſuch a diſpenſation;</hi> that's another end which thou maiſt probably think that God aimeth at. Afflictions are to <hi>humble us, and to prove us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>God calleth aloud to thee to take thy heart off thy creature-comforts.</hi> Thou ſeeſt what gourds, what bloſſoms they are, what ſhadows they are which thou huggeſt, what lyes thou haſt in thy right hand; he calls now to thee to fix thy heart and thine eyes upon him alone, and to make him alone thy portion, to fix all thy delight upon him.</p>
                  <p>For us that are ſpectators of ſuch Providences, let us alſo by them learn wiſdom.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>By taking heed of ſuch ſins, as may provoke God to ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations:</hi> we ſtand concerned if we <hi>love our children,</hi> to love God, and to <hi>fear him,</hi> to walk cloſely with him; the wicked life of a Parent may ſhorten the life of a Child, for that God in judgment may write him childleſs, a man who ſhall not proſper, nor his name out-live a preſent generation. Take heed of thoſe particular ſins, which may provoke God to ſuch a ſtroke. Take heed of murmuring at the bleſſing of a numerous off ſpring, and diſtruſting the Providence of God, as to a providing for them. Take heed if Children be given you, that you do not ſet your heart upon them. Look upon them as fading flowers, and ſuch
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:192227:297"/>flowers as never fade ſooner, than while they are worn too near your heart. Take heed of ſins by which the enemies of God <hi>ſhall be made to blaſpheme. David</hi> for ſuch ſins loſt his new born Child from his beloved <hi>Bathſheba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. More eſpecially, take heed of <hi>neglecting your children. Neglect not the ordinance of Baptiſm as to them.</hi> I do not think that is damnable; but I do think it is provocative of God. I remember God met <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Inn, and was about to kill him for his <hi>omiſſion of Circumciſion.</hi> Circumciſion was in it ſelf a pitiful thing, but it was Gods ordinance, it was his <hi>Covenant in the fleſh with the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> We are not upon a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, to ſay, To what purpoſe is it? or what good can it do? If the Jewiſh Child had dyed before the 8th day, its want of circumciſion doubtleſs did not endanger its ſalvation; but the deferring it beyond that time, might for ought I know, endanger the wrath of God upon the Parent, and that wrath might be executed in cutting off the Child. I take the caſe to be much the ſame under the Goſpel, I am ſure the <hi>Covenant</hi> is the ſame; take heed of neglecting to inſtruct your Children betimes, or to reprove and admoniſh them; God may cut them off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and then your neglects will be a grief of heart to you.</p>
                  <p>Finally, This calleth to all young ones, <hi>not to neglect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their creator in the days of their youth.</hi> O let your tender years be no temptation to you, to put off your duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and your own ſouls; in the morning of your life, be plowing up the fallow ground of your hearts, and ſowing the ſeed of righteouſneſs; indeed, in the evening our hands ſhould not be ſlack; but who knoweth whether he ſhall ſee an evening, yea or no?</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>MY buſineſs is to clear up the equity of the Lord in the ways of his <hi>Actual Providence,</hi> and to vindicate the juſtice and holineſs of God from thoſe, who by the Sophiſtry of their humane wiſdom, ſeek to darken Divine knowledg. I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the difficulties relating to the motions of Divine Providence <hi>in punitive diſpenſations.</hi> I have ſhewed you, how juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable it is, that God ſhould be the Author of the <hi>evil of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> And that 1. to his own people, notwithſtanding the <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt</hi> accepted for them, and the remiſſion of their ſins as to eternal puniſhment. 2. As to thoſe whom yet he knows to be ſuch, as will be worſe for their afflictions, and not better. 3. <hi>As to children</hi> who have not been guilty of actual ſins: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now a ſtep further. God doth not only puniſh ſin with <hi>ſmart,</hi> with pain, diſeaſes, croſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he ſometimes puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>ſin</hi> with <hi>ſin;</hi> for ſin, giving men up to be led captive by their luſts. The Text ſpeaketh of ſuch a Providence. It relateth to the Heathens, of whom the Apoſtle had been before ſpeaking, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19, 20, he had been declaring what means they had to know God; they had not indeed the light of the Goſpel, but they had the light of nature. <hi>That which might be known of God was manifeſt in them, for the inviſible things of him, from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> Then he ſheweth how they abuſed and miſimproved theſe means, for <hi>v.</hi> 21, when <hi>they knew God</hi> (in ſome meaſure, as the light of nature, and works of creation, would diſcover him to them) <hi>they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:192227:299"/>imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned; profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image, made like to corruptible man, to birds, to four-footed-beaſts and creeping things.</hi> The buſineſs was this: The Heathens had indeed but an imperfect knowledge of God, no more than the light of nature, and the works of God in nature ſhewed them; but yet this was enough to have let them know that God could not be like a man, or a beaſt, or a creeping thing; yet ſuch images and repreſentations of God they made, and worſhipped: <hi>wherefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, verſ. 24.) <hi>God alſo gave them up to luſts of uncleanneſs,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo again in my Text, verſ. 26. <hi>For this cauſe, God gave them up to vile affections;</hi> and ſo again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. And even as they <hi>did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things which are inconvenient. Being filled with all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Now the Queſtion is,</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How it can conſiſt with the holineſs and purity of God thus to puniſh ſin with ſin; for their committing of ſome ſins to give them up to commit others?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The difficulty is, becauſe it is hard to conceive how God ſhould do this, without a willing of ſin. Although therefore it is plain enough in the Text, and twice more repeated in the Chapter, it be ſaid, <hi>God gave them up to uncleanneſs,</hi> and God <hi>gave them up to a reprobate mind:</hi> yet it will not be amiſs for us from other Scriptures to take ſome auxiliary help for the proving of this, That there hath been, and doubtleſs are ſtill ſuch diſpenſations of God. Then I ſhall attempt to reconcile theſe Providences to the <hi>juſtice, holineſs</hi> and <hi>goodneſs of God;</hi> after that I ſhall make ſome application of my Diſcourſe upon this Argument. It is a known Text which you have, Iſaiah 6.9, 10. <hi>Go and tell this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hear you indeed, but underſtand not; and ſee you indeed, but perceive not; make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy; and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</hi> It is a Text which you find quoted ſix times in the New-Teſtament, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.40. <hi>Act.</hi> 28.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. In the firſt place <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. it is ſaid that in them is fulfilled the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaias, By hearing you ſhall hear, and not underſtand; and ſeeing you ſhall ſee, and not
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:192227:300"/>perceive. For this peoples heart is waxed groſs, and their ears are dull of hearing,</hi> &amp;c. That Text plainly makes it out, that Gods judicial giving them over to their blindneſs, was conſequent to their <hi>ſinful ſtopping of their ears, and ſhutting of their eyes.</hi> But Chriſt there ſaith, that <hi>for this</hi> he ſpake <hi>to them in parables, Mat.</hi> 13.13. but <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. it is ſaid, <hi>God hath given them the ſpirit of ſlumber; eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and ears that they ſhould not hear;</hi> and certain it is, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had Gods commiſſion, chap. 6. and Acts 28.26. <hi>Well ſpake the Holy Ghoſt, by Iſaias the Prophet to our Fathers, ſaying, Go unto this people, and ſay, Hearing you ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand; and ſeeing you ſhall ſee, and not perceive. For the heart of this people is waxed groſs, and their ears are dull of hearing; and their eyes have they cloſed.</hi> By all which it clearly appears, that God puniſhed the former ſins of the Jews in their wilful ſhutting their eyes, and ſtopping their ears againſt the revelation of the Divine will, by a judicial gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them up to a blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart. To this purpoſe is that, 2 Theſſ. 2.11. <hi>And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lye:</hi> for what cauſe? verſ. 10. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> Many other texts there are, ſpeaking of Gods hardning the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the hearts of others; but theſe are ſufficient to evince, that there is ſuch a dreadful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God. St. <hi>John</hi> reciting the afore-mentioned text of <hi>Iſaiah, Joh.</hi> 12.39. ſaith, <hi>Therefore they could not believe, becauſe that Iſaias ſaid again, that he hath blinded their eyes, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hearts, that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand with their hearts, and be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi> So, as I ſay, it is clear there is ſuch a penal act of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and now that we are upon this argument, it will not be amiſs for us to enquire what ſins thoſe are which provoke God to ſuch a degree.</p>
                  <p>In the general they were <hi>ſins againſt light;</hi> ſins againſt the light of nature. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſuch ſinning, Rom. 1. <hi>When they knew God, they glorified him not as God;</hi> they knew God by the light of nature, and ſinned againſt that light. All the other texts ſpeak of ſinning <hi>againſt the light of Revelation.</hi> God for mens bold and impudent ſinning againſt natural light, or againſt the light of his word, doth many times deliver up men in this manner. But the great queſtion is,</p>
                  <pb n="549" facs="tcp:192227:300"/>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How is this reconcilable to the goodneſs, purity, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God in Scripture doth frequently declare that he delights not in the blood of ſinners, his willingneſs that all ſhould be ſaved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He doth as plentifully declare, that he is of purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquity; that he tempteth no man, and cannot be the author of ſin. Now how can God give up men to <hi>blindneſs of mind,</hi> to <hi>hardneſs of heart,</hi> without <hi>willing it?</hi> and if he willeth it, how ſhall he be excuſed from being the author of it? To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we mean by the goodneſs of God, <hi>his kindneſs unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in order to their converſion and healing, and being ſaved; there is nothing of that nature to be expected from God under this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.</hi> It is the ſeal of reprobation and damnation; thoſe poor ſouls are left to the judgement and condemnation of the laſt day, without any great hopes of mercy; they have had their time, their means, their mercies; the patience of God hath a long time waited upon them; their glaſs is now run out; Gods day of grace is come to an end, as to them: <hi>Leſt</hi> (ſaith God by the Prophet) <hi>they ſhould convert and be healed.</hi> Gods frequent declarations, that he deſireth not the death of ſinners, do not oblige God for ever to ſtrive with <hi>ſinners,</hi> ſhutting their eyes, and ſtopping their ears, and hardning their hearts. It is enough that God hath a long time waited upon theſe ſinners, and hath had no fruit of his patience with them. But now if by the goodneſs of God we underſtand his <hi>juſtice, purity and holineſs,</hi> ſo I doubt not but to evidence to you, that under ſuch tremendous diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, yet God is a <hi>juſt, pure and holy God.</hi> To this purpoſe</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place let us conſider, 1. <hi>What God doth under theſe diſpenſations.</hi> 2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder what circumſtances thoſe ſinners are, whom God brings under them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us underſtand, <hi>What God doth in theſe diſpenſations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> We ſay God doth not infuſe <hi>any malice into a ſinners heart;</hi> this indeed were to make God <hi>the author of ſin.</hi> God putteth no malice into the heart of ſinners; he excites no malice in their hearts; and this both the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (who conſpire together to reproach <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervants of God, with the odious reproach of making <hi>God the author of ſin</hi>) have been told by as many as have treated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:192227:301"/>this argument; but they have a mind to revile, <hi>The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them.</hi> This is the meaning of the Schoolmen, when they ſay, that God doth not harden any, <hi>quantum ad rationem defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi> but only <hi>quantum ad rationem ordinis.</hi> Now how they ſhould make God the <hi>author of ſin,</hi> who freely grant this, they ſhould do well to make us underſtand: and I would fain have them ſhew me, where either <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Beza,</hi> or <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> or <hi>Pareus,</hi> or <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> or any other whom <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Tile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or any other ſo boldly traduce, as making God the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin,</hi> have ſaid any thing of this nature; they all agree with <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in ſaying, that God hardneth none <hi>impertiendo malitiam:</hi> but this only telleth you what God doth not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place, <hi>God doth undoubtedly withdraw thoſe means, which ſhould effectually keep them from ſuch ſins;</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is not unrighteous with God, for he <hi>may do with his own what pleaſeth him.</hi> Had not the Lord with-held this grace from the Angels, and from our firſt Parents, neither had the firſt fallen from their glorious ſtate, nor the ſecond from the ſtate of innocency; by which it appeareth, that this is no more than the Lord might have done if the ſinner had not ſinned: to ſay the contrary, were to make God a debtor to his creature; but this is no more than <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, and all the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> will grant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God doth undoubtedly leave this poor wretch whom he thus puniſheth, to act according to the <hi>impetus of his original luſt and corruption, according to that luſt which is in his heart.</hi> No man can deny but this is conſiſtent with the juſtice, purity and holineſs of God. If for God to leave or ſuffer men to walk in their own ways, not to quench the original luſt which is in their heart, but to ſuffer them to put it forth in actual ſin and wickedneſs, would make God the author of ſin; God muſt be concluded the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all that ſin which is committed in the world. But it is written, <hi>He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> and his grace could not be grace if it were not free. But thus far all are agreed, that God doth harden <hi>negatively</hi> and <hi>permiſſively.</hi> I hope there is none will doubt, but that if a traytor deſerved to dye, and to ſtarve to death, though a Prince had it in his power to pardon him, or ſupply him with bread to keep him from dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that manner; yet the Prince were juſt if he did neither of theſe, but ſuffered him to periſh according to his deſerts; but
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:192227:301"/>(as I ſaid before) this is denied by none. All the diſpute is, whether God doth any <hi>poſitive act</hi> in the hardning and blinding of ſinners: this is denied by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and by the <hi>Arminians</hi> alſo. In oppoſition to which I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though God doth not <hi>poſitively harden nor blind any ſinners,</hi> yet he doth do ſome <hi>poſitive acts, that relate to the hardning and blinding of them.</hi> I ſay he poſitively hardneth none, he doth not make their <hi>ſoft hearts hard,</hi> nor poſitively <hi>blind any;</hi> he doth not <hi>ſhut their eyes,</hi> and of ſeeing make them blind. Here now the difference lies betwixt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with <hi>Arminius,</hi> and thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divines whom they would aſperſe with this imputation, of making <hi>God the author of ſin,</hi> becauſe theſe Divines cannot allow God to be a meer ſpectator, an idle looker upon his works of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: they inſiſt upon this Argument, which certainly is not to be anſwered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In all acts of puniſhment God doth ſomething poſitively.</hi> But the Scirpture mentions <hi>the giving up of ſoms ſinners to vile affections,</hi> to a <hi>reprobate mind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as acts of puniſhment.</hi> Therefore God as to them doth ſomething poſitively. The <hi>minor</hi> is evident from the ſtile of the Scripture. Now for the <hi>major,</hi> Certainly in all all puniſhments God acteth as a <hi>Judge,</hi> and therefore muſt do ſomething poſitively. The infliction of a puniſhment, argueth a poſitive judgement of God. Beſides (which is noted by <hi>Pareus</hi>) God is ſaid ſeven or eight times over to harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, and many others who never had any grace to be withdrawn. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is very obſervable, that the words which the Scripture maketh uſe of to ſignifie Gods penal action in hardning ſinners, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.21. &amp; 7.3. &amp; 10.1. are ſuch as cannot be expounded by a <hi>bare permiſſion or deſertion,</hi> and ſignifie a <hi>vehement intenſion of the action,</hi> being verbs of the ſecond and third Conjugation in the Hebrew. This is a great point in Divinity, let me therefore tell you what our Divines ſay in their own words, and then exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine if it be not reconcileable by our reaſon to the juſtice and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God. <hi>Parens</hi> ſaith, That it is ſufficient that God in theſe tremendous diſpenſations, acting as a Judge, by way of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment (which as the Scripture plentifully affirms, ſo <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himſelf granteth) God muſt act in it not meerly privative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but poſitively; we need not be curious to examine the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how he acteth. <hi>Fit illa traditio explicabili, ſive inexplicabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, occulto quidem, ſed ſemper juſto modo,</hi> whether we be able to
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:192227:302"/>open, or not open the manner; God doth it always by a juſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a ſecret judgment; but, ſaith he, in three things it ſeems to be explicable: 1. <hi>By leaving men to the</hi> impetus <hi>and force of their own luſts.</hi> This, ſaith he, is a general way; for all that periſh, are thus left to themſelves; yet it cannot be ſaid properly of all ſuch, that God hath delivered them up to hardneſs of heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>By giving them means of ſoftning; ſuch are precepts, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, his works,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which they through the wickedneſs of their hearts only uſe to their further hardening.</hi> Thus it was in the caſe of <hi>Pharaoh, Sihon,</hi> &amp;c. This on their part was a ſin, on Gods part a juſt judgment; but it may be this is not the caſe of all, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hardly applicable to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> whom God ſo gave up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 26. 3. A third way (ſaith he) (which is more univerſal) is <hi>by delivering them up to their luſts, and to Satan,</hi> to be further blinded, ſeduced, and hardned, as in the caſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> mentioned in this firſt Chapter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>The God of this world hath blinded the eyes of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not.</hi> Now that Satan ſeduceth ſouls by command from God, appeareth by the ſtory of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.22, 23. <hi>The Lord hath put a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all theſe thy prophets.</hi> Another great Divine opens it in theſe particulars: God (ſaith he) hardneth ſinners,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alesbury de e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno Dei decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> p. 226.</note> By immediately <hi>depriving them of reaſon and counſel, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them, ſo as their rage is increaſod againſt God;</hi> for this he giveth us the inſtance of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whoſe heart was the more hardened by the plagues which he felt; and for this he quoteth <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, one of the Popes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God immediately hardneth the hearts of ſinners (ſaith he) <hi>by giving them up to Satan,</hi> that they may be by him hardned, as in the caſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and thoſe mentioned in the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. (Saith he) he hardneth them <hi>per ſe ipſos,</hi> by themſelves, giving them up, as my Text faith, to <hi>vile affections.</hi> Thus <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> is ſaid thrice to have <hi>hardned his own heart; Pharaoh</hi> by his own free-will hardned his heart, and God hardned it by his juſt judgment. God permitted the Heathens to ſin yet more and more, and by an actual motion moved them to an act of ſin (ſo far forth as it was an act).</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, (ſaith he), God poſitively <hi>hardneth ſinners, By giving occaſions, which through the luſt that is in them, incline them
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:192227:302"/>to evil.</hi> God propoſeth to them what things in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould induce, and perſwade them to that which is good, but they through their luſt and malice make them an occaſion to evil. Thus, ſaith he, God provoked the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>emulation by a fooliſh nation; by ſhewing grace and mercy to the Gentiles,</hi> the rage of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt Chriſt grew greater. Thus Chriſts Preaching and Miracles, were occaſion to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blaſpheming. But (ſaith that excellent Author) if we rightly underſtand it, it is not of ſo much moment, whether we ſay that God hardneth men <hi>poſitively,</hi> or <hi>negatively;</hi> for though as to the execution in the <hi>event,</hi> the act be <hi>negative,</hi> yet this event floweth from the poſitive purpoſe of God. It is therefore all one, whether we ſpeak in the words of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 29.4. and ſay, <hi>God hath not given them an heart to perceive, or eyes to ſee, and ears to hear;</hi> or in the phraſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. <hi>God hath given them the ſpirit of ſlumber, eyes they ſhould not ſee, and ears they ſhould not hear until this day;</hi> for the will of God is as effectual in his negative as poſitive actions. And now I think I have told you the utmoſt our Divines have ſaid in this cauſe, unleſs ſome of them have ſaid, that God is the Author <hi>of his own judgments and puniſhments,</hi> which I think none can with modeſty deny,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Twiſſ. Vind. gratiae,</hi> 3.163.</note> it being no more than the Scripture ſaith of all thoſe things which are of a <hi>poſitive nature,</hi> but not of thoſe things which are of a <hi>privative nature,</hi> which yet he may will ſhould be done by his permiſſion, though not by his efficiency; and this is no more than <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, that God is <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fector actus,</hi> though no more than <hi>permiſſor peccati.</hi> The ſum is, if we underſtand by the <hi>puniſhment of ſin with ſin,</hi> Gods judicial act, by which he withdraweth his grace, or his leaving of ſinners to the ſatisfaction of their own luſts; there is no queſtion, but God for mens former ſins may do this, yea more than this: he may judicially deliver men up to their luſts, and to Satan to be ſeduced at his pleaſure, and offer them occaſions (in their own nature leading to good) which they through their corruption may turn to further ſinning. But God cannot puniſh the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins of any, by putting any luſt or malice into their hearts, by which they become more evil, or otherwiſe than accidentally, ſtirring up that luſt and malice which is in their heart. This is the ſum, ſo far as I know, of what Divines ſay, as to Gods acts in the <hi>puniſhment of ſin,</hi> by delivering them up to farther ſinnings,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:192227:303"/>though I think <hi>Paraeus</hi> ſaith true, that beſides theſe ways in which God acteth <hi>poſitively,</hi> and more than <hi>barely negatively</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively, God hath many other ways which we cannot explicate, by which he puniſheth ſin with ſin; for who knoweth, or is able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold all the ways of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far we have ſeen (ſo far as we are able to comprehend) what God <hi>doth</hi> in this his judicial act of puniſhing ſin with ſin.</p>
                  <p>Let us now conſider under what circumſtances thoſe are whom God bringeth under ſo ſevere a diſpenſation. I anſwer, <hi>They are not only ſinners</hi> (for God doth not deal thus with every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner), <hi>but ſuch as have provoked him to a very great heighth and degree, ſhutting their eyes againſt that light which hath ſhone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and contemning the precepts of God, and the means he hath uſed to reclaim them:</hi> Such was <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> firſt he hardned his own heart, which I think is ſaid three times over; then God ſaith he would <hi>harden his heart:</hi> ſuch were the Heathen, mentioned in this Chapter, they had prodigiouſly ſinned againſt the light and law of Nature: Such were the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom this judgment is denounced, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>Now this being rightly underſtood, I appeal to the reaſon of any one that heareth me, although this be a moſt tremendous diſpenſation of God; yet whether it be not ſuch as is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, both with the Juſtice, and Purity, and Holineſs of God. Is it not juſt with God to puniſh ſinners, eſpecially prodigious ſinners, and ſuch of them as have ſhut their eyes, leſt the light ſhould ſhine upon them? If it be juſt with God to throw ſuch into Hell, why ſhould it not be juſt with him to ſeal them up to that damnation? might he cut them off by death, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn them into Hell? why may he not leave them deſtitute of his grace, and give them up to a reprobate mind, and to vile affections, and an hard heart, which are but the <hi>praeludia</hi> to this damnation? Doth any doubt whether this be conſiſtent <hi>with the purity and holineſs of God?</hi> I ask, why may not God deny his <hi>means of grace</hi> to whom he pleaſeth, and yet be an holy God? and may he not then deny it to, or withdraw it from thoſe that have abuſed his patience, and turned his grace into wantonneſs and laſciviouſneſs? doth he deliver them up to Satan to be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeduced, hardned? Is not Satan Gods inſtrument in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners? may not the juſt and holy God uſe what inſtruments he pleaſeth for the execution of his wrath?</p>

                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>But doth not God by this become the Author of ſin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, If ſin be conſidered in its true nature, as it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, a filthy action contrary to the Law of God, ſurely none can be the Author of it, but either he <hi>who doth it,</hi> or who <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades,</hi> or <hi>commandeth,</hi> or <hi>inciteth to the doing of it.</hi> God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infuſeth that luſt which is exerciſed, nor commandeth, nor perſwadeth the exerting of it. If we conſider <hi>ſin</hi> as the <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin,</hi> ſo the permiſſion of it is but a <hi>juſt diſpenſation of God,</hi> and a <hi>judicial act;</hi> and why God ſhould not be the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of puniſhments,</hi> I cannot underſtand.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>But doth not God in this diſpenſation will the ſins of theſe poor wretches?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, He doth not <hi>will the doing of them,</hi> but he <hi>willeth that they ſhould be done;</hi> and in this ſenſe he willeth all the ſin that is committed in the world; for as nothing could be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his will, ſo he doth not govern the world as an idle ſpectator, only looking on to ſee what his creatures will do. But he is far from <hi>willing the actions,</hi> either ſoliciting, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, or perſwading, or aſſiſting them.</p>
                  <p>Object. 3. <hi>But God giveth occaſions to them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It is true, but it is through the <hi>luſts of mens hearts that they become ſuch occaſions.</hi> They are in themſelves either of ſuch a nature, as they might improve for their good, and ought to have done ſo: ſuch were the Miracles which God ſhewed <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or which <hi>Chriſt</hi> did before the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> which <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preached to them, or at leaſt ſuch as had in themſelves no tendency to produce ſuch an effect. The Governeſs of the houſe doth not think that ſhe is either principal or acceſſary to a ſervants theft, becauſe ſhe ſuffereth pieces of Plate to go freely up and down for the uſe of her family, which poſſibly becometh a temptation to the luſt of her ſervant, to make him or her to ſteal.</p>

Suppoſe a Miſtreſs in a Family did know that her ſervant would ſteal ſome of thoſe things which ſhe ſuffers to go up and down and be commonly uſed in her houſe, is ſhe therefore bound to look them up, and let her whole Family want neceſſary utenſils?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Exho.</hi> And what application can be proper to this diſcourſe but <hi>an Exhortation to all to take heed of preſumptuous ſinnings againſt Light.</hi> That ſort of people amongſt us whom we call <hi>Quakers,</hi> call to all men to <hi>take heed to the Light within them.</hi> I will not profeſs perfectly to underſtand their principles. But they ſeem in ſome of their diſcourſes, to me to think, that <hi>men have Light enough within them to ſhew them the way to Heaven;</hi> and if ſo, that will prove a great miſtake: but thus much is certain, That every man hath <hi>a light within him. That which may be known of God is manifeſt in them,</hi> Rom. 1.19. Every man that is born into the world, hath a natural light, diſcovering ſomething of God, and of his duty to him, and is under a <hi>natural Law,</hi> which obligeth him to ſome duty in proportion to his light. The Apoſtle in this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. ſaith of the Heathens that <hi>they knew God,</hi> and hinteth, that they ought to have glorified him as God, that is, to have paid an homage to God proportionable to the knowledg which they had of his glorious being. But <hi>we</hi> who are within the pale of the Church: <hi>have</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>a more ſure word of Prophecy. Whereunto we ſhall do well to take heed, as unto a light ſhining in a
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:192227:305"/>dark place,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. Beſides this, many have a common illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Spirit, ſo far ordinarily attending the Miniſtry of the word: of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. And the Law of conſcience, ordinarily worketh according to this Light. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed true there are and will be differences, as to all theſe Lights. The light of nature varies according to mens parts and education. The <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Revelation</hi> according to the Miniſtry of the word men ſit under, and the other according to Gods pleaſure who by his Spirit irradiateth ſome more than others; but according to our light ſo doth conſcience lay a Law upon us. Now men and women are highly concerned, to behave themſelves both toward God, and towards men <hi>according to the light they have,</hi> that is, according to the diſcoveries they have either from natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or from the word of God, or the illuminations of the Spirit of God, what God is, and what God requireth of them either as acts of homage immediately towards him, or as acts of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and brotherly love towards their neighbour; eſpecially to take heed of bold and impudent actings to the contrary: for this cauſe it is that God judicially gives many up to blindneſs of mind, hardneſs of heart, vile affections, a reprobate mind, <hi>having the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts, who being paſt feeling have given themſelves over unto laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.18, 19. You ſee both from this Chapter in which my Text is, and from that Text, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. That it is what may <hi>befal poor Heathens,</hi> which have no more then a <hi>natural light,</hi> yet even they for not living up to that, may ſo far provoke God: what do you think Chriſtians may do then, that beſides the natural light, have the light of the Law and Goſpel, the <hi>ſure word</hi> of Prophecy? that have conſciences further enlightened, and under a further Law than the Heathens could poſſibly have? ſuch <hi>as have,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Taſted of the heavenly gift, and been made partakers of the holy ghoſt, as have taſted of the good word of God and the powers of the world to come?</hi> If the Heathens came under ſuch a judgment, becauſe when they knew or might have known by the very light of nature, that the Lord that <hi>made Heaven and Earth;</hi> could not poſſibly be like a man, nor a beaſt, nor creeping things, yet would not attend to the workings of their own reaſon, nor give their conſciences leave to ſpeak, nor hearken to them, but in their

Doth not the light of nature, and the light of Scripture ſhine in mens faces, and clearly diſcover to them, that God is not to be pleaſed with rude and confuſed noiſes, with meer formalities, and lip-labours, but with a ſimple, pure, and Spiritual worſhip, where the underſtanding, the heart and the affections go along with the tongue, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; and where theſe are wanting all the cringings, and bowings, and roarings in the world, are abominable to him, and no better than the howling of a Dog, and grunting of a Swine. O Sirs, take heed of ſinning againſt this light, for fear of being given up of God to ſuperſtitious vanities: for ſo it oft-times falleth out, that as a lyar, though at firſt he knew he told a lie, yet by repeating and telling it often, he hath forgot it was a lye, and poſſibly himſelf thinks he is relating a true ſtory. So I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it falls out with many whoſe conſciences at firſt grumbled a little at what they did, and told them this was no ſervice of God; but through a juſt Judgment of God they ſhutting their Eyes againſt the light, at laſt think there is no other true worſhip of God beſides what they have taken up, as to which it will at laſt appear, that it was none at all; for <hi>who required any ſuch things at their hands?</hi> We can hardly think otherwiſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who at the firſt ſetting up of idolatry by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and that worſer idolatry by <hi>Ahab,</hi> could not but think (many of them) that that was not the true worſhip of God; but by practice in it afterward grew ſo warm for it, that none elſe muſt be true, but they muſt ſlay the Lords Prophets, and perſecute all thoſe who either taught or practiſed any other way of worſhip more according to the mind and will of God.</p>

Yet we have lived to ſee it. I am loth, I tremble to ſpeak what I think; certainly God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken theſe poor creatures; they profeſſed the truth, to have imbraced it in the love of it, but they were hypocrites, they received it not in the love of it, but meerly in a faction, and for ſome baſe ſiniſter ends, and for this cauſe. God hath given them up to ſtrong deluſions, God hath thrown them off his hand of reſtraint, withdrawn his common grace from them, given them up to the <hi>Devil</hi> even in this life; God is now puniſhing upon them their former falſhood. Give me leave to ſpeak my fears, I profeſs they are my thoughts, my ſad thoughts, that we live in an age as full of perſons that have ſinned the ſin that ſhall never be forgiven, as any age ever was ſince our Lord was upon the Earth. <hi>The ſin unto death,</hi> for which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith <hi>we ſhould not pray,</hi> muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be prodigious ſinning againſt light, let but <hi>malicious</hi> be added to it in any Soul; and I then ſhall believe he hath not ſinned the ſin againſt the holy ghoſt, when I ſhall ſee God renewing ſuch a one by repentance, and not before.

You that yet ſtand, O look to your ſtanding, I would have you look upon men, that have had formerly much light, made great profeſſion and are fallen off to open courſes of Sin, as ſad examples of Divine vengeance, as if they were turned into Hell.

                  <p>You muſt know that theſe Chriſtian inhabitants of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> lived in the firſt and moſt furious times for Goſpel perſecutions, when the Heathen amongſt whom they lived, had gotten a law, and by <hi>that law</hi> (as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid of Chriſt) thoſe that owned the name of Chriſt <hi>ought to die,</hi> or to be plundered of their Eſtates, and impriſoned; and amongſt ſo many Heathens it was not poſſible, they ſhould want <hi>Informers.</hi> Nor did they want ſome Judges that would to the utmoſt execute thoſe ſevere Laws upon them. Now in the enduring of all thoſe hard things for Chriſt and his Goſpels ſake, theſe Chriſtians had ſhewed admirable patience; and for this the Apoſtle thinks himſelf bound to bleſs God, <hi>For it is given to us on the behalf of Chriſt to ſuffer,</hi> as well as to believe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 21.9.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Prop. <hi>That thoſe perſons who in this life have not known God, or have not obeyed the Goſpel of Chriſt, when Chriſt ſhall come to judgment ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>That amongſt ſinners, the perſecutors of others unjuſtly for their conſcience toward God, and for the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhall leaſt eſcape this righteous Judgment. Theſe above others ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with everlaſting deſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emphaſis of the propoſition, ſo far as I deſire to handle it, lies in the word everlaſting; <hi>they ſhall</hi> (ſaith the Text) be puniſhed with <hi>everlaſting deſtruction,</hi> which is no more than our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.46. <hi>And thoſe ſhall go into everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the righteous into life eternal,</hi> and <hi>Math.</hi> 9.44, 46, 48.
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:192227:310" rendition="simple:additions"/>Where you read <hi>of a worm that never dieth,</hi> and <hi>a fire that is not quenched.</hi> The Revelation of Scripture in the caſe is plain enough: only here is the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How it can ſtand with the Juſtice, or goodneſs of God, to puniſh momentary Sins, with everlaſting deſtruction?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The grounds of this Queſtion or doubt are.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The proportion which Juſtice</hi> ſeemeth to require betwixt the <hi>offence,</hi> and the <hi>puniſhment.</hi> Juſtice amongſt men requireth a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi> as well as puniſhment it ſelf; and it is with us accounted injuſtice not to keep a meaſure in puniſhment. Every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the <hi>Roman</hi> taking away the life of his Servant, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of a cup-board of glaſſes he had broken, and we count it hardly juſt, to do the like for little things ſtollen from us: now there ſeemeth to be no proportion betwixt momentany ſingings and eternal puniſhments. <hi>Tertullian</hi> rightly calls ſins <hi>vaporata libi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinum momenta,</hi> And the holy ghoſt calls them <hi>the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> It is the ſame caſe as to the profits of ſin, man that is born of a woman hath but a ſhort time to live; and no longer time to ſin in, then he hath to live.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Eternal torments</hi> ſeem to bear no proportion to that <hi>infinite goodneſs and mercy of God,</hi> which we have read of to be in God. They ſay indeed of <hi>Nero,</hi> that having condemned a malefactor to long torments, and pleaſing himſelf to ſee him ſo tormented, when the poor wretch called to him for mercy, he gave him no other anſwer, then <hi>Nondum tecum in gratiam redii;</hi> ſtay Sir, you and I are not friends yet, but is it poſſible without blaſphemy to imagin any ſuch thing of God, of whoſe nature it is to <hi>forgive,</hi> and to <hi>ſhew mercy?</hi> Can he pleaſe himſelf with the eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a creature which he hath made? No, no, (ſaith the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist</hi>) Hell is but a bugbear, there can be no ſuch thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Juſtice and goodneſs of God as Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>But the Scripture affirms it, ſuffer me therefore in general to cry out, O you Sons of men, <hi>are not the Lords ways equal? Are not your ways inequal? who art thou, O man, who reaſoneſt with God? Shall the clay ſay to the Potter why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> Is not our Reaſon debauched think we when it can agree no better with the Reaſon and wiſdom of God, whence it deriveth, and that in
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:192227:311"/>a lefs proportion, than a drop of water beareth to the Ocean, or the Fountain from which it deriveth?</p>
                  <p>Know therefore that all theſe vain and Atheiſtical reaſonings of our hearts proceed upon one, or more of theſe miſtaken prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That Gods compaſſion, goodneſs or mercy, muſt be Eternally extended to, and exerciſed upon, the moſt notorious deſperate deſpiſers and contemners of it.</hi> Now this is indeed to fancy an idol to our ſelves inſtead of God: we have no reaſon ſo to conceive of God, partly becauſe we find no humane nature ſo tame, though we be under a Law of ſhewing pity and compaſſion; partly, becauſe the Scripture no-where teacheth us ſuch a notion of God. Beſides, that ſuch a notion of God as this is would diſarm the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and perfect being of all power to protect it ſelf, from the greateſt injuries which the moſt debauched perſons ſhould offer to it. I would gladly know what reaſon, or what part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can induce any to dream of a goodneſs, and mercy of God towards finners beyond this life?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That the goodneſs and mercy of God muſt be eſtimated, and meaſured by his diſpenſations to individuals.</hi> Amongſt men, mercy to ſome <hi>particular perſons</hi> that are eminent diſturbers of humane Society, is cruelty to thouſands poſſibly. Gods mercy may be exerciſed, and he may be a God in whom all that the Scripture ſaith of that goodneſs, that is in the Divine being, may be verified, and yet hundreds yea thouſands of impenitent ſinners may eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally periſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That the proportion which the Divine Juſtice obſerveth in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſinners, muſt be meaſured by the proportion of time which the ſinner hath to ſin in.</hi> Than which there nothing more falſe, nor (as I ſhall anon ſhew you) is there any ſuch rule kept to in the juſtice of men.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>That the Juſtice of God is to be meaſured by the ſame meaſures as the Juſtice of men,</hi> and nothing which amongſt men is injuſt can be juſt with God; where-as among men, we ſee the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments are not judged juſt as to all men: all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (though the fact be the ſame) otherwiſe puniſh injuries done to ſuperiours than to inferiours, and it is thought but juſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the puniſhment to the quality and greatneſs of the perſon to whom the injury is done.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="565" facs="tcp:192227:311"/>5. <hi>That the condemned ſinner ſatisfies by his ſuffering,</hi> than which there is nothing more falſe. No creditor takes his debtors lying in priſon, whatever miſery he feeleth there, to be any part of payment of his debt. Theſe are ſome of the miſtaken Principles, from which vain man quarrelleth at the Divine Juſtice, in the eternal deſtruction of ſinners. Now theſe things premiſed, I ſhall eaſily ſhew you, that eternal puniſhment is not inconſiſtent with the Juſtice of God, nor doth any way derogate from that infinite goodneſs and mercy which is inſeparable from the Divine Being.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Why ſhould we not</hi> (in the firſt place) <hi>allow that to be juſt with God, which we allow to be juſt and righteous in man?</hi> What doth man leſs than this according to the extent of his power? Doth not the Magiſtrate for his offence deprive the Traytor, the Murtherer, or other Malefactor, of his life, and all the comforts of it for ever? Divines ſay, that in Hell there is a <hi>pain of loſs,</hi> and a <hi>pain of ſenſe;</hi> and the Schoolmen argue the former to be greater than the latter: you ſee man inflicteth an eternal <hi>pain of loſs,</hi> and counts it juſt; he taketh away the <hi>malefactors life,</hi> and all the <hi>ſweet concomitants</hi> of it from him for ever; he impriſoneth him during life, baniſheth him from his Country, never to return, confiſcates his eſtate for ever: Yet who quarrels with him as if he did unjuſtly?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But will ſome ſay, God doth not only adjudge a ſinner to an eternal loſs of his life, eſtate, liberty, this indeed man doth; <hi>but God adjudgeth him alſo to eternal torments, to a never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying worm, a fire that never ſhall be quenched.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, Had man the ſame power, he would alſo do the ſame thing, and yet hope to be acounted guiltleſs: where eminent injuries are done to perſons of great place and power, How many are angry, and will not be reconciled, though they be under a Divine Law obliging them to the contrary? How doth man ſometimes divide a Malefactors laſt puniſhment, and ſuffers him not to dye at once, but by piece-meal, to make his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as long-lived as he can? What will you ſay of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be ſtarved to death? Yet in ſome great crimes, who calleth this cruelty or injuſtice? The greatneſs of the offence is in this caſe judged to juſtifie the extraordinarineſs of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="566" facs="tcp:192227:312"/>2. <hi>What injuſtice can it be in God, to be ever exacting ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to a debt which is never paid,</hi> eſpecially when the debtor hath alſo refuſed his pardon for it? Suppoſe one of us hath a debtor who oweth us a great ſum of Money, we offer him, that if he will come to us, and upon his knees but ask pardon, we will forgive him the debt; he refuſeth, we lay him up in Priſon, ſtill he payeth us nothing; Which of us counteth it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to keep this wretch in Priſon as long as we can? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we do not for ever keep him in Priſon, is becauſe that neither we, nor he, are of eternal duration. If indeed the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the ſinner a Thouſand, Ten thouſand years, did give any ſatisfaction to God; this were unjuſt: But who counteth a debtors lying in a Gaol, any payment of, or ſatisfaction for his debt? There are two things may be ſaid of every ſin, which ſhould make the thoughts of ſin very dreadful to every underſtanding Chriſtian. 1. <hi>That all the holy actions of all the men in the world, cannot make God amends for one ſin.</hi> It is a true ſaying of <hi>Drex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellius, Omnium bonorum ſanctae actiones unius lethalis noxae pondere ſuperantur.</hi> 2. <hi>That the ſevereſt puniſhment which any poor wretch can ſuffer for ſin, cannot give God ſatisfaction for the leaſt ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. What pretence can there be of charging <hi>God with unjuſtice, for continuing a puniſhment upon that ſinner, that continueth his impenitency.</hi> If a ſinner in everlaſting torments indeed either ever could, or did repent, there might poſſibly be ſome pretence for this imputation of injuſtice to God, or at leaſt, ſomething might be colourably ſaid to derogate from the goodneſs and mercy of God, in not delivering him from thoſe torments: Though that Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.9, 11, poſſibly be not to be underſtood of Hell, yet you have in it, a true picture of ſuch as are under the condemnation of it. When the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth</hi> Angels <hi>poured out their vials, and had power to ſcorch men with fire,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, That <hi>they were ſcorched with great heat, and blaſphemed the name of God, which had power over thoſe plagues, and repented not to give him glory.</hi> And again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, <hi>They blaſphemed the God of Heaven, becauſe of their pains, and their ſores, and repented not of their deeds.</hi> I ſay theſe two verſes give you as to this thing, a true picture of Hell. Sinners are there plagued, and ſcorched with heat, but they repent not, to give glory to God. Had they in this life repented, they had never come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:192227:312"/>thoſe flames. In that ſtate indeed, there is no place, no means for repentance, nor hath any ſufferer there any heart for it. <hi>Non decebat juſtitiam dei poenitere non poenitentium injuſtitiae hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae;</hi> It did not become the juſtice of God to repent, as to their puniſhment, who never repent of their own injuſtice, and unrighteouſneſs. What man pitieth a perſon laid in Gaol for contriving Treaſon againſt his Prince, or Country? Becauſe he continueth there, whiles even in Priſon he goes on to revile, and threaten, and act what miſchief is in his power under his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? And will not ſo much as ſay that he hath done amiſs, nor beg his Princes pardon? This is the caſe of the damned ſoul: in this life he ſinned, but refuſed to repent, though he was often called to, and admoniſhed to repent; God throws him for his ſin, continued in impenitently, into Hell; there he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth not, he ſaith not ſo much as, I have ſinned, Lord have mercy upon me: Is God think you unjuſt in keeping this hardened, ſtubborn, and impenitent ſinner in an eternal Priſon? In this the ſinner is like to the Devil, and to his evil Angels; as the Saints in the reſurection are made like to the good Angels: ſo ſinners are like to the evil Angels. The Devils never repent, they never ſay, what have we done, they never ask God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; no more do ſinners that are once condemned to a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſociety with them for ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>What injuſtice can there be in God, never to ceaſe from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing that ſinner, who never ceaſeth from his acts of ſin?</hi> I ſhall not here concern my ſelf in that queſtion, <hi>whether the blaſphemies of the damned be ſins, yea, or no:</hi> For my own part, I ſee no reaſon why they ſhould not be called <hi>ſins,</hi> they are the acts of <hi>rational creatures contrary to the Law of God.</hi> If the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had in this life ceaſed to do evil, he had never come in thoſe torments; if he ceaſed not to ſin in this life, I ask when he ceaſed, or by what other name we can call the blaſphemies of damned ſouls becauſe of their torments, than that of ſins againſt God? If they be ſins, I ſay, damned ſouls never ceaſe to ſin. Are not the blaſphemies of the Devils ſins? And are not the blaſphemies of damned ſouls of the ſame nature? But I will not enlarge upon this, for it hath a great cognation to the former.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>If it were not unjuſt with God to annex the penalty of eternal deſtruction to his threatning againſt ſin, it cannot be unjuſt with
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:192227:313"/>him, having enacted a Law under ſuch a penalty to execute it.</hi> The truth of this dependeth upon this principle, That it can be no injuſtice, to put a juſt Law in execution, which is ſo plain, as that it demonſtrateth it ſelf to every mans reaſon. For what is <hi>Juſtice</hi> in the <hi>execution</hi> or practice of it, but <hi>the putting of juſt laws in execution?</hi> Beſides, what is neceſſary cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. <hi>Hath the Lord ſpoken it, and ſhall he not do it</hi> (ſaith the Prophet)? God having enacted ſuch a Law, and affixed ſuch a threatning to it is concerned in truth, to give being to the execution of it. So that all I have to do, is to evince the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and juſtice of God in making ſuch a Law, which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you, if you pleaſe to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The influence which it hath upon thoſe who ſhall be ſaved,</hi> as a means to bring them to Heaven; this appeareth, from that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11, <hi>We knowing the terrors of the Lord, perſwade men:</hi> as alſo from the frequent uſe which both our Saviour and his Apoſtles make of this argument, to deter men from ſin, and to engage them to that duty which they owe unto God; in the performance of which they ſhall obtain ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life and ſalvation. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> uſeth it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.7. Our Saviour uſeth it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. The Apoſtle uſeth it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10, and in many other places of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such a Law hath undoubtedly a great influence <hi>upon the worſt of men,</hi> and keepeth them in awe, ſo as they dare not be ſo vile, as they otherwiſe would be. I have told you of that Heathen who is reported to have ſaid, <hi>That if God had not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed death by his Law, it was yet ſo neceſſary for mankind, that it had been reaſon that Governours ſhould have eſtabliſhed ſome Law, to have determined mens lives at ſuch or ſuch times.</hi> The Heathens knew nothing of the Revelation of Gods Will, as to the eternal deſtruction of any; but ſaw ſuch a ſanction ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the rule and government of the World, that they figured ſuch a thing, a place where thirſty <hi>Tantalus</hi> ſhould have rivers juſt waſhing up to his lips, and yet he ſhould not be able to drink of them; where weary <hi>Siſyphus</hi> ſhould be always la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to roll a ſtone up the hill, for which he ſhould never be able to find a reſting-place. The Heathens ſaw the neceſſity of frighting the world with a Sanction, for eternal puniſhments, for the puniſhment of wickedneſs. It is a ſaying of <hi>Cicero, Itaque ut aliqua in vita formido improbis eſſet poſita, apud infero ejuſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:192227:313"/>quaedam ſupplicia impiis antique conſtituta eſſe voluerunt, quod videbant his remotis, non eſſe mortem ipſam pertimeſcendam.</hi> Orat. 4. <hi>in Catilinam:</hi> That is, <q>That wicked men might in this life have upon them ſome fear of puniſhment, the Ancients would have ſome puniſhments appointed in Hell; for they ſaw, that without this, even death it ſelf would not be feared.</q> Hence it was that <hi>Origen</hi> (one of the Ancients) though (as he had many other errors) he thought the puniſhment of the damned ſhould one day have an end; yet (as they ſay) he would never openly publiſh his opinion, being aware what a deluge of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs it would let in upon the world. I would offer it to any reaſonable mans thoughts, to conſider, what leſs than a threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of eternal deſtruction could be in prudence judged, to bear any proportion to the impetuous luſt of rage and paſſion, that diſturbeth humane nature. Governors affix to their Laws, the penalties of perpetual impriſonment, baniſhment, whippings, brandings, burning, hanging, hanging drawing and quartering: we ſee this is not ſufficient, hundreds of perſons throughout <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in a year, are cut off, notwithſtanding theſe Laws, and theſe puniſhments: It is true, ſome hope of eſcaping, and not being detected, may a little encourage; but this is not the main, they know if the worſt comes that can come, it is but exerciſing patience for an hour or two, and they are out of their miſery. I appeal to every conſiderate perſons judgment, whether he doth not think, that if the aw of an eternal deſtruction were of the world, the world would not be a Thouſand times more full of Traytors, Murtherers, Blaſphemers, Adulterers, Thieves, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers of all Divine and humane Laws than it is at this day, though it be now full enough; if they do not think ſo, their thoughts are very ſhallow, and they will be at a loſs, to tell us how the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianized parts of the world are more civil, and have fewer of theſe exorbitancies, than are to be found amongſt <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians:</hi> if they do think the world would be much worſe, I would fain know of them, whether the eſtabliſhing a law for the eternal deſtruction of ſinners, were not both juſt, and a piece of infinite Wiſdom in God. Now, if it were juſt for God to eſtabliſh ſuch a Law, I am ſure it muſt be a piece of diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice in God to put it in execution; yea, and his truth muſt be alſo concerned in it: he hath ſpoken it, and he muſt do it; for he cannot alter the thing that hath gone out of his lips.
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:192227:314"/>It is I think reaſonably ſaid by an ingenious Author, <hi>That it more concerneth the glory of God, to keep many from ſin, than to keep a few from Hell.</hi> The Glory of God is far more highly his concern, than the ſalvation of particular perſons. Gods Glory is more advanced by the reſtraint of ſin in the univerſality of mankind, than it is hindred by the damnation of any part of them: And methinks we might without any great difficulty agree this, when-as it appeareth, both by our Laws, and the daily proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our Courts of Judicatory; we agree it to be more for the publick good of a Nation, that the Government and Laws of a Nation ſhould be maintained, than that the lives of hundreds of <hi>Traytors, Murtherers, Thieves,</hi> and other miſcreants, that are diſturbers of humane polities, and ſocieties ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But this is further advantaged from the conſideration, <hi>That this righteous Sanction of eternal deſtruction, is executed under the Goſpel upon none to whom it hath not been a mean before to keep them from it.</hi> I have told you, that as to thoſe ordained to life, it is a means to preſerve them from wrath to come, to hear of it, the Miniſters of the Lord knowing the terrors of the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men; and by the conſideration and the hearing of theſe terrors, as by a partial mean, they are brought into a ſtate oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to it, a ſtate of eternal joy and felicity. To the whole of mankind, it is a mean to reſtrain them from ſin: I now add, that theſe poor wretches, who at laſt drop into the Pit as the demerit of their ſins, continued in without repentance, have, or might have formerly heard of it denounced againſt them, as a means to keep them from it, and to bring them to an eternal felicity. Now doth man judge it a righteous thing, having made, and promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Laws to his Subjects, telling them what ſhall be judged Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and what ſhall be the puniſhment of a Traytor, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promulged his Laws, that they might take heed of <hi>Treaſons, Murthers,</hi> or other <hi>enormous crimes;</hi> If afterwards they will commit them, that his Law ſhould be rigorouſly executed upon them, to the confiſcation of their goods, the depriving them of their liberties, yea, and lives too: I ſay, doth man thus judge? and ſhall we think it an unrighteous thing with God, when he doth not ſurprize ſinners in their heaps of ſin, but publiſheth his Law in his word, promulgeth it by Miniſters, and therefore pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth it, that men and women might be by the terrors of the
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:192227:314"/>Lord perſuaded, and warned to flee from the wrath that is to come, and take heed of having their portion in that place, where the worm never dieth, and the fire never goeth out; yet notwithſtanding, in defiance of the authority of God, and in the contempt of his Law, they will go on, and take no warning to execute this Law upon them? To conclude this Meditation, to execute a juſt Law, can be no injuſtice, no cruelty, and in God it is neceſſary to vindicate both his authory, and truth. This Law of <hi>eternal deſtruction,</hi> as the puniſhment of ſin, conſidered in its firſt eſtabliſhment, was a juſt Law: Juſt, becauſe a means to bring many to Heaven, becauſe an univerſal mean and moſt prudential, and almoſt alone effectual to reſtrain ſin in the world; and becauſe it was firſt a <hi>mean</hi> to preſerve them from the pit, who at laſt through their own choice, ſtubbornneſs, and wilfulneſs, do fall into it. It is therefore impoſſible that it ſhould be any injuſtice in God to put this Law in execution, to puniſh impenitent and incorrigible ſinners with <hi>eternal deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>The proportion which Juſtice is to obſerve, and adjuſt betwixt a puniſhment and an enormous ſinful act, is by no means to be meaſured, by comparing the time, or degree of pleaſure, which the ſinner hath had for his ſinning, or in his ſinful act, but by comparing the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, either with the dignity of the perſon injured and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or with the damage done by the offence, or with the malice, treachery, and perfidiouſneſs of the perſon offending.</hi> It muſt be acknowledged that diſtributive juſtice is to obſerve a proportion betwixt the puniſhment, and the nature of the offence: And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this true principle it is, that this objection, theſe reaſonings of ours, againſt the juſtice of God in the <hi>eternal deſtruction</hi> of ſinners do proceed. But I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This <hi>Proportion is not to be meaſured, either by the time the ſinner hath had to commit his ſins in, or by the degree of pleaſure, which the ſinner hath had in his inordinate ſinful actions.</hi> That's all which the caviller in this point againſt Divine Juſtice hath here to ſay: What proportion is there between the ſins of a few years, and <hi>eternal deſtruction?</hi> being tormented in Hell Ten thouſand times ten thouſand years? But who amongſt men meaſureth thus the proportion of any puniſhment to any kind of offences amongſt men? The Murtherer hath killed his neighbour, the Traytor his Prince, his work was done in a ſmall part of an hour; it may
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:192227:315"/>be very few days were taken up, either in the contrivance or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his deſign. Doth juſtice require, that the time of theſe Malefactors Impriſonment, or torture in Death, ſhould not exceed the time of the contrivance, or execution of their ſin? who ever ſo judged? There is nothing more ordinary in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, than to ſay, that diſtributive Juſtice ought to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Geometrical proportion</hi> between perſons and things, not according to an <hi>Arithmetical proportion,</hi> obſerved in dealings between man and man. The meaſure then of a ſinful action is not to be taken from the duration or continuance of a ſinful Act. But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From the dignity of the perſon offended, injured, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> He that murthereth his Prince is puniſhed otherwiſe, and more ſeverely than he who murthereth his equal. By Gods Law, if the Daughter of the <hi>High Prieſt committed uncleanneſs ſhe was to be burned,</hi> Levit. 21.9. So was not every one who was an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs; but ſhe had <hi>defiled her father,</hi> and therefore was not to dye an ordinary death. It is only ſaid, <hi>he that curſeth his father or mother ſhall dye,</hi> Levit. 20.9. In our Law, If a perſon mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth his equal, or inferiour, he or ſhe ſhall be hanged, they ſhall dye the ordinary death of malefactors; but if the Woman murthereth her Husband, the Child his Parent, the Servant his Maſter, they ſhall be burned; if the Traytor murthereth his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, he ſhall be hanged, drawn and quartered: The injury is done to their ſuperiors. Now there is not ſo great a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt the greateſt Emperor, and the meaneſt Villain in the world, as there is betwixt the great God of Heaven and Earth, and his creature: Nor is there ſo great a diſproportion betwixt hanging, burning, and torturing to death, and eternal puniſhment, as there is betwixt an infinite and a finite being. Sin taketh an infiniteneſs, from the infiniteneſs of that God againſt whom it is committed. And ſo is <hi>objective infinitum,</hi> objectively infinite; ſo as there is no diſproportion, though the puniſhment be as they ſay <hi>durative infinita,</hi> infinite in duration. The durative infiniteneſs of the puniſhment, is adequated to the objective infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Sin is to be meaſured by the damage it doth to the perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, or to the publick.</hi> Upon this principle of Reaſon proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another reaſon of different puniſhments: He that meerly curſeth or ſpeaketh evil of his Prince, ſhall not be puniſhed as
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:192227:315"/>he that murthereth him. Now ſin wrongeth God infinite ways. <hi>In his Soveraignty.</hi> The ſinner ſaith, God hath no Authority over me, no power, no right to command me; my thoughts are free, I will think what I liſt; my tongue is my own, I will ſpeak, God hath nothing to do with me; it wrongeth God <hi>in his holineſs,</hi> it ſays the Laws of God are not holy, it wrongeth him in his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, Omnipotence, All ſufficiency,</hi> in his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> in all his Attributes: It were a great work to ſhew you how many ways ſin wrongeth God; it is <hi>intenſive infinitum,</hi> intenſively infinite, and therefore a puniſhment of an infinite extenſion, is but proportioned unto it. I paſs over the injury done by it to man, as not to be compared with this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sin is to be meaſured by the <hi>falſhood, treachery, malice and perfidiouſneſs of the perſon offending.</hi> Hence the traytor, the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous child, the bloody wife and ſervant are more ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than others that do the ſame things to other perſons, becauſe they violate a truſt, and ſhew the greateſt treachery and perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs. Iniquity takes the greater heinouſneſs from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt obligations to the contrary duty. Now in all ſinning againſt God there are the greateſt failers of faith and duty, the greateſt abuſes of love and goodneſs imaginable. So as if we thus take our meaſures, juſtice keeps but a due <hi>geometrical proportion</hi> in the eternal puniſhment of the momentary ſins of ſinners; for as is the <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to the <hi>offence,</hi> ſo is the <hi>party offended to the party offending.</hi> As the puniſhment is without end, infinite, whereas the ſins were momentary and temporary: ſo the party offended was infinite, and the ſinner who dared to defie infinite Majeſty, and diſobey an infinitely great and glorious God was but a finite worm. As is the <hi>injury in ſinning</hi> to a man, ſo is the vengeance in puniſhment to the ſin. Man is a poor pitiful worm, but by ſin he doth an infinite wrong to God; it cannot be expreſſed how he diſhonoureth God: there is no meaſuring the depth of the guilt in ſin. Sin is indeed a finite thing, but it is puniſhed with an infinite puniſhment; proportioned well enough to the infinite wrong done to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine being by it. Let this be a ſixth Demonſtration of the juſtice of God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The juſtice of God in the eternal puniſhment of finite tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ſins, is cleared in this, <hi>That the ſinner hath ſinned, in ſuo aeterno, in his eternity.</hi> There is in every ſinner <hi>infinita voluntas peccandi,</hi> a will to ſin infinitely and without end. This I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:192227:316"/>a learned Author calleth <hi>peſſimam adhaeſionem peccati,</hi> one of the worſt circumſtances of ſin. That the ſinner doth not ſin eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, is from Gods quicker cutting aſunder the thred of his life: had the thred of a ſinners life run out to eternity, he would have ſinned to eternity. Suppoſe one amongſt the damned who had not ſpent above twenty or thirty years in the world in ſinning, I would appeal to the judgement of any deliberate man, whether this man would not willingly have lived fifty, ſixty, or an hundred years, and if he therefore did not deſire to live ſo long, that he might take his fill of ſin, ſatiate himſelf with his luſts; he who ſaith otherwiſe muſt charge God with damning a ſoul, who, he knew would have repented, if God would have ſuffered him to have lived long enough; and can any entertain ſuch a thought of God? If the ſinner had lived for ever he would have gone on in his ſins for ever; then there was in him a kind of infiniteneſs in willing ſin. This account of the juſtice of God in the eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſinners, is given us by <hi>Greg. Mag.</hi> I will give you his words in Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>They who cavil (ſaith he) at the juſtice of God in this ſpeak right, if the juſt Judge of the whole earth did not proceed againſt men, as well for their thoughts as their actions: wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mens ſins are therefore finite, becauſe their lives are ſo. They would have lived eternally, that they might have ſinned eternally;</q> for they more deſire to ſin than to live, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſire to live always, that they might never ceaſe to ſin. <hi>Gr. Mag. mor. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore righteous with God that their puniſhment ſhould never end, whoſe ſinful hearts knew no end in their willingneſs and luſtings to ſin. The ſinner hath no end as to Divine Vengeance, becauſe as long as he could he would know no term in ſinning. It is not juſt with man to puniſh the intentions and motions of the heart, becauſe he can but gueſs at them; he cannot certainly know them till they appear by ſome overt actions. Our Law makes it treaſon to imagine the death of the King; indeed the Traytor is not puniſhed till his imagination be diſcovered by ſome overt words or actions, by which alone man can judge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and imaginations: but to ſhew us how juſt even man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times judgeth it, eſpecially in ſome great crimes, to puniſh intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; very ſmall overt actions will ſometimes ſerve to judge of the counſels, deſignes and intentions of a malefactors heart.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="575" facs="tcp:192227:316" rendition="simple:additions"/>8. <hi>The juſtice of God in puniſhing ſinners with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, is apparent by his propoſal of an eternal reward to the greateſt ſinners, if they will repent and turn unto him.</hi> God ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before every ſinner an eternal life, as well as an eternal death; the ſinner maketh his choice, he chooſeth death rather than life; ſo as the proportion of Juſtice in the puniſhment, is juſtified by the proportion of the reward offered, in caſe the ſinner would leave his ſins and turn unto God. This account <hi>Aquinas</hi> gives of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God in this particular. <hi>The ſinner</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>refuſeth and putteth from him an infinite good, and deſpiſeth an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able good for things that are mutable.</hi> Gods puniſhments are no greater nor of longer duration, than his rewards are which are propoſed to the ſame perſons, if they would have turned from their ſins, that they might have lived.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Who can ſo much as in a ſecret thought charge God with injuſtice, in the eternal puniſhment of a ſinner, who remembreth <hi>that God for the ſin of man laid a puniſhment upon an infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was the Son of his eternal love:</hi> and this the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 3.26. <hi>Was to declare his righteouſneſs: To declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of him who believeth in Jeſus.</hi> Now in this we are ſo far from quarrelling at the juſtice of God, that there is no Chriſtian that doth not adore and admire it: what is the difference? There God puniſhed an infinite perſon for a time; here he puniſheth finite perſons in an infinity of time, that what they cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the intenſion of their ſuffering, they might be ever doing in the extenſion of time: yea and this difference more is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, God in puniſhing his Son, laid our iniquities upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; here the ſinner beareth none but his own burthen, and doth but ſuffer the puniſhment due to his own iniquity. Now if we will quarrel at Gods righteouſneſs in this loading of his own Son with the burthen of his wrath, we quarrel at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt contrivement of Divine and Infinite Wiſdom for the ſalvation of men: yet it is much more reaſonable to diſpute that than the juſtice of God, in the eternal perſonal puniſhment of a ſinner. It is the ſaying of <hi>Nierembergius.</hi>

                     <hi>Illud mihi videtur ridiculum, mirari Divinam ſeveritatem in aeterna ſceleſtorum punitione, nec intendere infinitam illam juſtitiam in innocentia unigeniti dilecti ſui: Quid mirum torqueri in aeternum ſceleſtos pro peccatis ſuis ſi paſſus eſt pro alienis juſtiſſimus Dei fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius?

                     <q>It to me (ſaith he) ſeemeth ridiculous to admire at Divine ſeverity in the eternal puniſhment of wicked men, and not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that infinite juſtice in the innocency of his only beloved Son. What wonder is it that wicked men ſhould be for ever tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for their own ſins, if the moſt righteous ſon of God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the ſins of others. He that without a reproach to his goodneſs could endure his moſt dear Son to ſuffer ſo long as one hour, will much better endure unjuſt ſinners to be tormented with eternal puniſhment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Laſtly, <hi>It is the greateſt error and madneſs imaginable for any ſoul to dream of mercy in God, after the contempt and deſpiſing of his goodneſs and mercy, to a final impenitency.</hi> What is Divine goodneſs and mercy, but the will of God inclining him to do good to miſerable creatures. This, we ſay, is to be found in God, and that to an infinite degree; and is abundantly ſeen in his long-ſuffering and forbearance of them, and patience to them; in his waiting upon them all the days of their life, giving them his Goſpel, ſending them his Miniſters, beſeeching them to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God, knocking by his Spirit at the doors of their hearts. Thus the merciful God extendeth his goodneſs unto all ſinners, a long time he declareth that he deſireth not the death of any ſinner, but is willing that all ſhould be ſaved, by coming to the acknowledgment of the truth. The vile ſinner through the pride of his heart, will not ſeek after God, but vexeth, grieveth, reſiſteth his holy Spirit from time to time, refuſeth to repent and to turn unto God, defieth him, mocketh at the tenders of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace: thus he liveth, thus he dieth, yet hath heard of, and knoweth the threatnings of eternal deſtruction: he looketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as bug-bear things, not to fright ſuch men as he is, but children only: he drinks, he ſwears, he curſeth and blaſphemeth God; lyes, breaketh Sabbaths, he will venture it. Who is that God that ſhall reſtrain the luſts of his heart? He will try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be ſuch an Hell, ſuch an eternal deſtruction yea or no. What do we talk of mercy after this, to ſuch a bold defier of the Divine Majeſty? What kind of being muſt we fancy the eternal God, if we ſhould imagine him to have one drop of mercy for ſuch a contemner and defier of Divine goodneſs? Surely he that
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:192227:317"/>made this man will have no mercy on him, he that formed him can ſhew him no favour, without a dethroning himſelf, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf the contempt of his creature. This every ſinner doth, one more openly and boldly, another more ſecretly and tacitly. Every fool, if he doth not ſpeak it with his tongue, yet <hi>ſaith in his heart, there is no God.</hi> Whiles vain man talks of mercy in God in this caſe, I am afraid he fancieth mercy in God to be a paſſion as it is in us, which neceſſarily ſtirs to compaſſionate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry object of miſery. Alas! it is no ſuch thing, it is nothing elſe but the good will of God to do good to ſinners if they will be made partakers of his goodneſs: The ſame will moveth, and that juſtly too, otherwiſe after this life the red flag is then held out. The laſt grains of ſand in the glaſs of mercy are dropt out, when this life is determined. There is no more ſacrifice for ſin remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a dreadful looking for of Judgement and fiery indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſhall devour the adverſaries. <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes law, died without mercy;</hi> of how much <hi>ſorer puniſhment ſhall they be thought worthy, who have trodden under foot the blood of the Son of God, and have counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, as an unholy thing, Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27. Theſe men have done deſpight to the Spirit of Grace, and we know who hath ſaid <hi>vengeance is mine, and I will repay it, I will recompenſe</hi> (ſaith the Lord) and again, <hi>the Lord ſhall judge his people.</hi> I conclude then with the Apoſtle in that place, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> There is a time for all things, and as it is ſo with men, ſo it is with God: There is a time for mercy, that is the time of this life; and there muſt be a time for the execution of Juſtice, when God ſhall declare his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs upon ſinners who have deſpiſed his goodneſs and patience, that is the time after this life. The inch of Candle is out when the ſinners life is expired: no more coming to the waters, and buying then what before was offered without money, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price. Mercy hath done its utmoſt as to ſuch ſinners: no more mercy is to be found in God for them, no more compaſſion in that God who is full of mercy and tender compaſſion. Nor ſhall we need at all to ſtumble at this, for to oblige Magiſtrates to be always pitiful to them that are in miſery, though they have been the cauſes of it to themſelves, and have brought themſelves into miſery by the higheſt contempts of Authority and Government; yea and of the clemency and patience of the
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:192227:318"/>Magiſtrate, were quickly to proſtitute all Government, and to expoſe thoſe that manage it to the baſeſt contempt and ſcorn imaginable: and if the Princes and Judges of the earth, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of Armies upon the proſpect of this, ſee a neceſſity of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting limits to their bowels of compaſſion, and no one judgeth them either unjuſt or cruel in ſo doing; why may not the ſame be allowed to the holy and righteous God? But I have ſpoken enough to convince thoſe who obſerve the principles of juſtice allowed in the practice of all States and Governments, with the general obſervation of the wiſer ſort in the world, That God is neither cruel nor unrighteous in puniſhing with an eternal deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thoſe that know not God, and obey not his Goſpel, although their time and pleaſure of ſinning hath born no proportion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the time or degree of their torments. I ſhall apply it but in a word or two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt, <hi>To ſinners who are yet impenitent, who have not yet by repentance and faith ſaved themſelves from this wrath to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond to thoſe who <hi>through grace</hi> have ſaved themſelves from this wrath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To the firſt I ſhall only ſpeak after the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles. <hi>We knowing the terrors of the Lord, perſwade you.</hi> 1. <hi>Not to ſtand diſputing with God about the juſtice and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his ways.</hi> 2. While your time laſteth to ſave your ſelves <hi>from theſe eternal burnings,</hi> from this <hi>worm which never dieth,</hi> this fire <hi>which never goeth out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Diſpute not then Divine Juſtice, as to the eternal Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinners.</hi> You ſee if you do, you will fall in judgement, though you ſhould be tried by the common laws of men, by the cuſtoms and practices of all Nations. Flatter not your ſelves, that whatever your Miniſters tell you, the goodneſs and mercy of God will not allow him to ſee his creatures eternally tormented; or that the juſtice of God cannot allow him to puniſh the ſinnings of a few hours, or years with an eternity of torments. What have they to do with mercy who have out-ſinned their days and years of mercy, and deſpiſed the long-ſuffering, patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God, that for twenty, thirty, forty years together was leading them to repentance, and waiting for their converſion, and turning to him; who had a day and time of repentance, but
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:192227:318"/>repented not; an eternal life and happineſs offered them, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, and have judged themſelves unworthy of eternal life? O let all ſinners ceaſe diſputing Divine Juſtice, and preſuming upon I know not what mercy in God, and let them to day, while it is called to day, not harden their hearts, but ſtudy to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from this wrath that is to come! Let me but offer you one or two Meditations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider with your ſelves, <hi>how often you have deſerved this eternal deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his power;</hi> and how many are dropped into it, who never lived ſo long, nor ſinned ſo much as you have done? Do not you think that an High-way-man, or ſome other notorious villain, as he paſſeth by a pair of Gallows upon the road, hath many ſuch a cold thought as this: <hi>How many have periſhed upon this tree for ſtealing but a few ſhillings, or ſome things of little value? how often have I deſerved the ſame puniſhment, though I as yet eſcape?</hi> Oh that you who are yet in a ſtate of guilt and impenitency, would reflect upon your ſelves, and ſay, Lord! how many are dropt into the pit of eternal deſtruction, who never lived ſo long as I have lived, nor ſinned to that degree that I have ſinned! yet they are periſhed, and for ever periſhed, yet I live, and am out of that pit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>what an hairs-breadth there is betwixt you and this eternal deſtruction.</hi> You ſee ſome in a moment going down into the pit, ſome in an hours time, ſome in a weeks time; you ſleep over it every night, you tread over it every day; you need not be told how little there is betwixt us and death every day: How ſuddenly do you ſee ſome ſnatched away on your right hand? others ſnatched away on your left hand, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> drop into the pit with a lye in their mouths? What know you what this day, what the next night may bring forth upon our ſouls? Let me conclude this with an Exhortation much of that nature, which <hi>Daniel</hi> uſed to that great King.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, O Sinners! let my counſel be acceptable unto you, break off your ſins by a true repentance, and your iniquities, by a coming unto Chriſt; if ſo be you may ſave your ſelves from this wrath to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. In the ſecond place, Let the People of God, who are delivered from this wrath, and by grace tranſlated into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:192227:319"/>of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>look back with thankful hearts upon this danger which they have eſcaped.</hi> They tell a ſtory of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who being diſordered with drink, and riding over a bridg, where he very narrowly, but inſenſibly eſcaped the danger of his life; coming back the next day, and viewing his danger, he was ſo aſtoniſhed, as that he dropt down dead: your reflexion upon this eternal deſtruction, which (through grace) you have eſcaped, ought to have no ſuch influence upon you. But from the ſight of this dreadful wrath to come, which you have eſcaped, reflect theſe two more profitable Meditations upon your ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What hath God done for me, delivering me from ſuch a death?</hi> Oh how patient was God with me? how many nights did I ſleep over hell? how many days? how many years did I tread over theſe endleſs torments? Oh! what hath God done for me, in plucking my foot out of this ſnare, as a brand out of this fire?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>What ſhall I do? what, can I do enough for that God, who hath ſaved me from ſuch a death?</hi> how often might he have thrown me into Hell? <hi>O Lord, I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant, thou haſt ſaved me from that wrath which is to come.</hi> What an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement ſhould this lay upon us? <hi>in noſtro aeterno, to ſerve the Lord while we have any being.</hi> Let us therefore go away ſinging with <hi>David, We will extol thee, our God, our King we will praiſe thee for ever, and ever; every day we will bleſs thee, and we will praiſe thee for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 145.1. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me, bleſs his holy name; bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? who healeth all thy diſeaſes? who redeemeth thy life from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> [yea from eternal deſtruction] <hi>who crowneth thee with loving-kindneſs and tender mercies,</hi> Pſal. 103.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>

                     <q>Behold theſe are the ungodly who proſper in the world, they increaſe in riches. Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocency: For all the day long have I been plagued, and chaſtned every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>

                  <p>I Am indeavouring (as I have before told you) to make the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly rough ways of <hi>Actual Providence</hi> plain, expounding to you the hard Chapters of Divine Providence; I am ſtill ſpeaking to ſuch queſtions as relate to diſtributive juſtice, conſidered as in the hand of <hi>Actual Providence;</hi> and here alſo I have already ſpoken to ſeveral things: I am now come to the laſt which I intend to ſpeak to. It is the great queſtion which hath poſed the great Philoſophers of the world, and hath made ſome of them deny the <hi>being of God;</hi> others deny the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>Providence of God,</hi> or at leaſt reſtrain it to ſome particular objects; <hi>How it ſtandeth with the juſtice of God to puniſh and chaſten his own people, whiles in the mean time he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the way of the wicked to proſper.</hi> To handle this, I have made choice of this Text: it is no wonder that the greateſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have been poſed here, when we find the moſt eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God whoſe names ſtand upon Sacred Record, at a loſs to find out this riddle, and finding it a ſad temptation to them. You ſhall find that <hi>Job</hi> ſtumbled at it, <hi>Job</hi> 21.7. and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> though he humbly prefaceth his complaint, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1. with, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, in thy judgements;</hi> yet he muſt, he muſt <hi>talk with God about his judgements in this thing. Habbakuk</hi> was alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſturbed at it, Hab. 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:192227:320"/>endure any iniquity: wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deal treacherouſly, and holdeſt thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is better than himſelf?</hi> In my Text you find the man according to Gods own heart ſtumbling alſo at this ſtone, you have an account of <hi>his fall</hi> by this temptation, from the firſt <hi>ver.</hi> to the 16. 2. <hi>His recovery of himſelf,</hi> verſ. 17, 18, 19, 20. The Propoſitions which may be obſerved from this verſe, are two.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 1. <hi>That in this life ungodly men often proſper, and increaſe in riches, when in the mean time holy men are plagued and chaſtened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>That this is often a temptation to the beſt of men, to think that they have cleanſed their hearts in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay firſt, God in this life doth often meaſure out <hi>proſperity</hi> to the worſt, and <hi>afflictions to the beſt of men.</hi> The truth of the Propoſition as to matter of fact is evident, both from the Records of Scripture, and the whole courſe of Divine Providence in the diſpenſations of it, as through all ages, ſo in our preſent age, ſo as I ſhall not need ſpend any time in the proof of it. The Queſtion is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How this is conſiſtent with the <hi>Juſtice, Wiſdom,</hi> or <hi>Goodneſs of God, that the ungodly ſhould proſper in the world, and increaſe in riches, when his people are viſited with afflictions every night, and chaſtned every morning?</hi> I ſhall add further, <hi>to make uſe of the moſt vile and wicked men in the world, to chaſten thoſe that are more righteous than they are.</hi> This was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who (you know) were his great Enemies, were both moſt vile and wicked perſons, and that which <hi>Habbakuk</hi> expreſly complained of, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>And ſuffereſt the wicked to devour the man that is more righteous than he;</hi> The <hi>Caldeans,</hi> a vile and wicked people, to devour the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were the only peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple God had upon the Earth at that time. Here are three Queſtions to be ſpoken to:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>How it ſtandeth with the Juſtice of God to meaſure out good things to the vileſt and worſt of men?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>How it ſtandeth with the Justice and Goodneſs of God, by his Actual Providence to diſpenſe out evil things to the best of men?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>How it is conſiſtent with the Juſtice of God, to ſuffer the wicked to devour the man that is more righteous than himſelf?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="583" facs="tcp:192227:320"/>
                  <p>I will begin with the firſt, where we muſt enquire, 1. <hi>What good things wicked men have.</hi> 2. <hi>We muſt vindicate the Juſtice of God in the diſtribution of them to them.</hi> The good things which a wicked man hath, can be only <hi>the good things of this life;</hi> for the good things of another life, they have no part nor portion in that matter. 2. They can be none of the <hi>good things of grace,</hi> ſpecial grace; they are <hi>without God, without Chriſt, without hope.</hi> Hence muſt follow, that the good things of which alone they are capable, are either <hi>bona corporis,</hi> the <hi>good things of the body;</hi> ſuch are <hi>life, health, ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c. or the good things of <hi>fortune,</hi> as the Heathens call them, ſuch are <hi>riches, honours, pleaſures,</hi> or the <hi>good things of the mind,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>learning, wit,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe good things wicked men are capable of, the wicked may <hi>live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come old, be mighty in power,</hi> Job 21.7. There may be <hi>no bands in their death,</hi> their ſtrength may be firm, they may not be in trouble as other men, as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſpeaketh here in this Pſalm. Now this being firſt premiſed, I come ſtrictly to ſpeak to the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place I deſire that may be remembred, which in ſome of my former diſcourſes I commended to your obſervation, <hi>That as adverſity is not the portion of every child of God, ſo proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is not the portion of every ſinner:</hi> nay if you fix your eyes upon any certain number of good men that live up to the rule of Gods word, and a like number of leud and wicked men, who live without a God in the world; you will find that as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity is on the ſide of them that fear God: <hi>Wiſdom hath riches and honour in her hand,</hi> as well as grace and glory; that which cheats us, is the odds that is in numbers betwixt men who fear God, and ſuch as fear him not, but fix your eye upon any number of certain perſons on either ſide, and you will ſee that Gods fulfilling of his promiſes to good men for the things of this life, ſuch as health, long-life, riches, honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſuch as fear him are not made in vain, and the juſtification of Gods truth in them, doth not ſtand in need of thoſe diſtinctions which we ordinarily make uſe of, they are only ſome that God proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As there is no godly man but hath ſin enough to juſtify in his afflictions; ſo there are many <hi>wicked men, who may have done ſome ſervice for God,</hi> which will juſtify God in ſuch rewardings of them. It is but juſt with God (as I have ſhewed you) for
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:192227:321"/>God to reward men for the ſervice which they have done for God; he rewarded <hi>Jehu, Aſſyria,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I have ſhewed you, <hi>that God with the rewards of this life, doth often reward, and with the puniſhments of this life doth often puniſh relations in their correlates;</hi> ſo God may reward, if not the <hi>perſon,</hi> for ſome ſervice he hath done for God; yet he may reward a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Grandfather</hi> in the riches, and honour, and outward good things which the preſent ſinner doth enjoy: it was thus you know in the caſe of <hi>Jehu,</hi> the proſperity of <hi>Joaſh</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and another or two deſcended from <hi>Jehu,</hi> was but the reward which <hi>Jehu</hi> had for his ſervice againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab.</hi> But I have enlarged my diſcourſe upon all theſe things before, and do only hint them here.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>good things of this life, are not truly good;</hi> they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called by us good, becauſe of their <hi>gratefulneſs to our ſenſe;</hi> they are in themſelves but things of a middle nature, good or bad, as we uſe them well or ill. It is the ſaying of <hi>Nierembergius</hi> (an acute Author, though a <hi>Jeſuite), Fortunantur improbi larvatis hujus vitae bonis ad correctionem noſtrae opinionis, ne putemus illa bona poſthumae noſtrae foelicitati comparanda.</hi> Wicked men, ſaith he, are inriched with the ſpecious good things of this life, to correct our judgments, that we may not judg that thoſe things are worthy to be compared with that felicity, which we after this life ſhall enjoy. The wiſer Philoſophers, in their diſputes about the happineſs of man in this life, which they rightly enough determined muſt lye in the enjoyments of the greateſt good, and their further queſt, what that <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> was, determined it could not be the <hi>good things of the body,</hi> nor the good things of <hi>fortune</hi> (as they call them, we ſpeaking more like Chriſtians, call them the good things of Common Providence), but at laſt determined (the wiſer of them I mean) that it was the goods of the mind in conjunction with a competency, or a moderate portion of the good things of the other natures. But Religion teacheth us to conſider man in another notion than they by the conduct of meer natural reaſon could conſider him, as a <hi>creature</hi> under an <hi>ordination to an eternal exiſtence,</hi> and capable of an <hi>union</hi> with, and an <hi>enjoyment</hi> of God. Now upon theſe two <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes,</hi> it is impoſſible that the good things of this life ſhould be <hi>vere bona,</hi> truly good things, and that upon theſe two grounds:
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:192227:321"/>1. <hi>They reach not to another life.</hi> What is our inch of time to Eternity? Now all theſe things leave us in the very hour that our ſoul goes out into an eternal ſtate; Riches, honours, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſtrength of body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all leave us when the body dyeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>While we are in the poſſeſſion of our breath, all theſe things do ſignify juſt nothing to the felicity of the ſoul,</hi> which is far the better and nobler part of man: the intereſt of the ſoul ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in its union and communion with God, to which none of theſe contribute any thing, ſo that the objection proceedeth upon an hypotheſis that is meerly falſe; it ſuppoſeth that God diſtributeth things truly and properly good to wicked men, he only diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſuch things to them as have a ſhew and appearance of good, ſuch things as to their palats and ſenſe are good, but have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of goodneſs in them, further than that they are a <hi>viaticum,</hi> things of neceſſary uſe to ſupport us in our way to eternity, and to uphold our beings in the world, while we are here doing the work which God hath given us to do, and finiſhing our courſe; and for that, what our Saviour ſaid is true, Our life doth not lye in the abundance of that which we poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though they be not things in themſelves good, nor abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and compleatly good; yet having ſomething of goodneſs in them, and a great goodneſs relative to the fancy, apprehenſion, and deſires of ſinners (for there be many that will ſay, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good)?</hi> underſtanding nothing elſe but corn, and wine, and oyl, a long-life, an healthful body, a great eſtate, honour and power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is but equal that God ſhould gratify their ſenſes, and pleaſe them with ſome ſuch things as they account the goods, the greateſt goods, <hi>That they might not be without ſome experience of the riches of divine liberality and bounty.</hi> God muſt be allowed to have a relation, unto the vileſt men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; he is not indeed their Father by <hi>Adoption,</hi> but he is their Father by <hi>Creation.</hi> It is not reaſonable that any of Gods Creatures, <hi>Abſque ulla liberalitatis experientia elabantur,</hi> ſhould go out of the world without ſome experience of the divine libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and goodneſs. I remember it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that for the Children he had by Concubines, he gave them portions, and ſent them away, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.5. <hi>Abraham gave all that he had unto Iſaac: but unto the ſons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and ſent them away,</hi> &amp;c. We may ſay the
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:192227:322"/>ſame of God, he gives <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> to his <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the promiſe; but as for others, he gives them gifts of the good things of this life; <hi>feſtinat largiri,</hi> ſaith an acute Author, God makes haſt to give out his largeſſes of mercy to them, becauſe they are not capable of the mercies of another life. God hath time in eternity to reward his Saints, but after this life he hath no time to give ſinners any thing. And this appeareth the more reaſonable, becauſe the worſt of men are not only Gods Creatures, but may be in ſome things Gods Servants, as the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> were Gods Servants: there are very few wicked men but God maketh ſome uſe of, if it be but to ſcourge his own people, for that was the ſervice which the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> did God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. But this I have before ſpoken to more largely.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is very reaſonable, if we conſider <hi>what there is in theſe good things of this life, which God giveth out to ſinners, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of means on Gods part, to allure and perſwade them to turn unto him.</hi> The Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>That the goodneſs of God leadeth men to repentance,</hi> Rom. 2.4. It doth ſo <hi>ex natura ſua,</hi> of its own nature, though through the wickedneſs of their heart, it but makes them worſe; ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. <hi>He left not himſelf without witneſs, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſs:</hi> and this he did, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>to nations whom he ſuffered to walk in their own ways.</hi> The buſineſs is not what theſe things prove eventually to ſinners, ſo indeed they prove but ſnares to their ſouls, that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally through the miſimprovement they make of them, by reaſon of the luſt and corruption that is in their hearts: nor is Gods intention and deſign in giving them the thing to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <hi>but what they are in themſelves,</hi> and of their own nature; ſo they are things which they deſire more than better things, which are grateful and pleaſant to them, and ſhould therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to ſerve, and pleaſe that God, who ſo gratifyeth and pleaſeth them in things which they make their delight, and the matter of their choice.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. What in the laſt place, if we ſhould ſay, that it is reaſonable God ſhould give them theſe things, as one expreſſeth it, <hi>In in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortuniis apparatum; that if they will not uſe them to their own good and advantage, yet they might give Gods glory an advantage by juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him in their condemnation upon their abuſing the goodneſs of
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:192227:322"/>God.</hi> They tell us a ſtory of <hi>Philip King of Macedon,</hi> and of ſome noble <hi>Romans,</hi> that they were wont to pray to their Idols, that they would mix their proſperity with ſome grains of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. It is a dreadful ſpeech, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. <hi>Wo to you that are rich, for you have received your conſolation.</hi> It is a ſaying of an ingenious Author, a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inſignitur ſolum titulus opulentiae ad juſtitiam damnationis, quia licet ipſa crimen non ſit multis fundatur criminibus, aut fundat multa; vel ſceleribus paritur, vel ſcelera parturit—ſolitarius ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus fortunae infamis eſt, niſi aliquid pietatis agnomen purget; Merem.</hi> That is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Riches is only a famous title to juſtify God in the damnation of a ſinner, for though they in themſelves be no crime, yet they are a building founded on many ſins, or they lay a foundation for many; they either are bred of many ſins, or elſe they bring forth many—The title of outward proſperity alone,</q> is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous title, if it hath not ſome addition of Piety. The wrath of God ſmoaked againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whiles the fleſh was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their teeth. God tells them by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> chap. 13. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>He gave them a King in his wrath.</hi> There is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wiſdom of Divine Providence ſeen in the proſperity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, their long-life, health, ſucceſſes, riches, honours: for one of theſe two things follow; ſome of them are by them made better, and brought home to God, as children by ſome ſlighty rewards are won unto their duty; or if the Providence of God obtaineth not this effect, it faileth not in another, <hi>viz. The juſtification of God before Angels and men, in his righteous condemnation of them:</hi> He hath given them time to repent, and they repented not; he hath given them mercies alluring them to their duty, but they have not been won by them; he hath <hi>piped unto them, but they have not danced:</hi> and thus much may ſerve to have juſtified the Providence of God, and ſhewed you the reaſonableneſs of its motion, in the diſtribution of the good things of this life to ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>It remains in the ſecond place to ſhew you, how it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth with the righteouſneſs and goodneſs of God to diſpenſe out evil things to his own people. Job</hi> complaineth of his ſad tryals, and <hi>David,</hi> that he was <hi>viſited every morning, and chaſtened eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment;</hi> and we ſee in our daily experience, that many are
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:192227:323"/>the tryals of the moſt righteous ſervants of God, and thoſe of all ſorts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay in the firſt place, This is not the lot of <hi>all the ſervants of God,</hi> it is only the portion of <hi>ſome of them;</hi> ſome of thoſe who fear God are rich, honourable, mighty in power, men of good eſtates, proſpering in the world: there was a rich <hi>Abraham,</hi> a rich <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a great man in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and a rich <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea; David,</hi> the man according to Gods own heart was a great Prince, ſo was <hi>Solomon;</hi> nay, as I ſaid before, were we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the odds in the number of Sinners and Saints, I doubt whether we ſhould not find that God with the good things of this life, doth not more univerſally bleſs his own ſervants than he doth others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſe that ſome, yea that many of the People of God in this world are toſſed with tempeſts, and afflicted; yet ſurely there is <hi>none of them but hath ſin enough to justifie God in their puniſhments of this nature.</hi> I have in my former diſcourſes proved to you, that notwithſtanding the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> which Chriſt hath paid to the Juſtice of his Father, and the <hi>Covenant of Grace made betwixt Christ and his Father, on the behalf of his Elect,</hi> and the <hi>pardoning of their ſins;</hi> yet it is conſiſtent enough with Divine Juſtice, to puniſh the ſins of Gods own People, with the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and puniſhments of this life: <hi>they may be chastened of the Lord, that they may not be condemned with the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.32. Now the moſt righteous man ſinneth ſeven times a day; nor doth any know how often he offendeth: <hi>and why ſhould a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his iniquity?</hi> Lam. 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you could imagine any perſon to have lived ſo innocently, as that he had not by his perſonal ſins deſerved thoſe temporal afflictions with which God viſiteth him; yet (as you have heard) <hi>God may viſit the ſins of Parents, of proparents, upon Children,</hi> and afflictions of this nature, may come upon good people, although not for their perſonal ſins, yet for the ſins of their Parents; and this is but righteouſneſs with God, as I have heretofore ſhewed you in a ſet diſcourſe upon that Subject.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But there is yet a fourth thing, which I would ſpeak to a little more fully in anſwer to this Queſtion, and that indeed takes away the Subject of the queſtion upon the point. As I ſaid of the good things of this life, they are not truly good, ſo I may ſay of
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:192227:323"/>the evil things of this life, they are not <hi>truly evil:</hi> as the other are but <hi>larvata bona,</hi> ſuch things as have but a <hi>Vizard</hi> of goodneſs; ſo theſe are but <hi>larvata mala,</hi> ſuch things as have but a ſhew and appearance of evil in them; they are only ſenſible evils, and our ſenſes do but cheat our Souls in judging them evil. This I will ſpend a little time to evince to you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, <hi>Theſe are not thoſe things which deſile the Soul.</hi> It was a ſaying of <hi>Auguſtines, There is a great deal of difference betwixt a mans being evil, and ſuffering evil.</hi> Many a Soul is made better by affliction, none is made worſe by it, unleſs it be by accident. Nothing but ſin defileth a Soul: a man may be poor in this world yet rich in grace, he may have a ſickly body, yet an healthy Soul he may be ignoble in the world, yet have the honour to be called the Child of God; thoſe things alone are evil, which make the Soul filthy, and unclean in the ſight of God. Afflictions tend to make the Soul white, to purge it and to cleanſe it, they are therefore compared to fire, and help to make our faith to appear more precious than Gold that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; they do not prejudice a Soul as to its grace, nor yet as to its glory; none was ever condemned by God becauſe he was ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or low in the world: Afflictions are only ingrateful to our ſenſe grievous to our fleſh; but as to our Soul and inward man, they touch it not, they do only ſully the ſurface of a man, they do no injury to all to his better part.</p>
                  <p>This Argument is plain, <hi>what doth the Soul of a Chriſtian no hurt is no evil.</hi> Why ſhould I call that evil which neither ever did me any hurt nor ever will?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Afflictions of this life are ſuch things as the beſt of Gods people have choſen and preferred before the contrary ſuppoſed good.</hi> This is a piece of that anſwer which <hi>Salvian</hi> long ſince, gave to this difficulty of Providence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Humiles ſunt Religioſi? hoc volunt: pauperes ſunt? pauperie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectantur? ſine ambitione, ambitum reſpuunt; in honore ſunt? hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem reſpuunt: lugent? lugere geſtiunt: infirmi ſunt? infirmitate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectantur,</hi> Salvian. de Prov.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Are good people (ſaith he) in a low condition? they deſire to be ſo. Are they poor? they are pleaſed with poverty; they without ambition refuſe the objects of ambition, hunt not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter great things. Are they without honour? they refuſe the honours of this world. Do they mourn? they rejoyce to mourn.</q> Are they weak? they triumph in their weakneſs,
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:192227:324"/>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24. <hi>By faith Moſes refuſed to be called the Son of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's daughter, chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt, greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt.</hi> The Apoſtle refuſed <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his mony, and that with a more than ordinary deteſtation. <hi>Agur</hi> indeed prayeth againſt extreme pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as a condition expoſing him to temptation; but he alſo upon the ſame account prayeth againſt <hi>Riches. Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>give me neither poverty nor riches. Moſt glady</hi> (ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10.) <hi>will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me; therefore I take pleaſure in my infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake, for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</hi> The Apoſtles ſing in Priſon, and <hi>rejoice that they are counted worthy to ſuffer for the name of Chriſt.</hi> The primitive Chriſtians <hi>ſuffered joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods.</hi> No man chuſeth what he apprehendeth evil, but thoſe things the world call evils have very ordinarily been the choice of the beſt, and moſt judicious ſervants of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How can thoſe things be called <hi>evils, which have a tendency to make the man better.</hi> Afflictions both from Gods intention, and their own nature, have a <hi>tendency</hi> to the making of the Souls of Saints better. God intends them for that purpoſe, for they are his fatherly Providence for them; all thoſe <hi>twigs</hi> which make up the <hi>rods</hi> with which God laſheth his people, grow out of the <hi>root</hi> and ſtock of <hi>Divine love.</hi> The rods with which God ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Sinners, are gathered of a Tree that ſtandeth upon the brink of the bottomleſs pit; but thoſe with which God chaſtiſeth his people, are gathered of a Tree that ſtands in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God. Nay afflictions have in themſelves a tendency to better the Souls of Saints. They are but like a warm wall to the fruit-Tree, which makes the fruit fairer; you obſerve that young Children ſhoot out in ſickneſs, you may obſerve the Saints too ſhooting out upon their afflictions; O how many of them have we ſeen ſhot out, in <hi>humility,</hi> in <hi>faith,</hi> in <hi>patience,</hi> in <hi>heavenly-mindedneſs,</hi> and <hi>contempt of the world,</hi> &amp;c. It is a ſaying of <hi>Salvian</hi> upon this Argument, <hi>Ideo Sancti viri ſunt infirmiores, quia ſi fortes fuerint vix Sancti eſſe poterint.</hi> 
                     <q>Saints, ſaith he, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore weak, becauſe it is an hard thing to be ſtrong and Saints too:</q> we may ſay it is hard to be rich in Gold and Silver, and rich in grace too; to be great in the world, and great with God too; to have an healthy body, and an healthy Soul too. It is
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:192227:324"/>true there is not an abſolute inconſiſtency, betwixt worldly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and grace. <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> were rich, <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were both honourable, and had great places; Our Saviour doth not ſay that it is ſimply impoſſible, for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God; but he ſaith, <hi>It is eaſier for a Camel to go through the Eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Let the word be underſtood of the beaſt called a <hi>Camel,</hi> or for a <hi>Cable-rope,</hi> and by the <hi>Eye of a Needle,</hi> whether you underſtand what we call ſo, or a gate, a little gate in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> which ſome ſay had that name; It is not ſimply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a <hi>Camel,</hi> or a <hi>Cable rope</hi> to paſs through the Eye of a Needle: it is a thing may be done, if you cut the one into pieces ſmall enough, or ſufficiently untwiſt the other; but it asks a great deal of labour, it muſt be done with a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.</p>
                  <p>There are three things in which the felicity of the Soul lieth, 1. <hi>In its favour with God.</hi> 2. <hi>In its conformation to God.</hi> 3. <hi>In its beatifical viſion of God.</hi> I ſhall ſhew you that ſome of thoſe things, which we call evils, have an influence upon all theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They do indeed none of them merit the love and favour of God, but <hi>they are teſtimonies and indications of this love,</hi> and this is eminently true of ſuch as are ſufferings for <hi>the name of Chriſt:</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Afflictions in general, <hi>whom he loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Child whom he receiveth.</hi> Chriſt ſaith particularly of the ſufferings of his people for him, <hi>They ſhall turn unto you for a teſtimony, Luk.</hi> 21.13. And the bleſſed Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. ſaith of them, that <hi>they are manifeſt tokens of the righteous judgment of God,</hi> that, ſaith he, <hi>you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which you ſuffer.</hi> It is a ſaying of <hi>Salvian; Quis tam profundi Cordis,</hi> &amp;c. He means, who is ſo ſhallow as to think that the rewards of the Saints are <hi>carnes &amp; fortitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines,</hi> abundance of the good things of this life; the love of God, ſaith he, is ſeen in higher things than theſe, and in things of a quite different nature from theſe. It is a paſſage of <hi>Auguſtine, Surgunt procellae hujus ſtagni, vides malos florere, bonos laborare, tentatio eſt, fluctus eſt, &amp; dicit anima tua, O Deus! Deus! Haeccine eſt juſtitiae tua, ut mali floreant, &amp; boni laborent: Deus tibi reſpondet, Haeccine eſt fides tua? Haeccine tibi promiſi, aut ad hoc factus es Chriſtanus, ut in ſaculo floreres?</hi> Aug. <hi>in</hi> Pſal. 25. <q>The ſtorms (ſaith he)
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:192227:325"/>of this Pit ariſe, you ſee ſinners flouriſh and Saints in adverſity, this is a temptation; it is a wave, and your Soul ſays, O God! O God! Is this thy Juſtice, That Sinners ſhould proſper, and thy Saints ſhould be oppreſſed? God anſwereth thee, is this thy faith? wert thou made a Chriſtian for this that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt flouriſh in this life?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the rich glutton in the Goſpel, who had his good things in this life. Gods <hi>Lazarus</hi> had evil things; far be it from us, ſaith <hi>Salvian,</hi> to think that an Argument of Gods neglect of us, which is an Argument of Gods further love to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Doth the happineſs of a Soul lie in its <hi>conformation to God?</hi> to <hi>the image of his Son?</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) Afflictions high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conduce to this end.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is peculiarly true of <hi>ſuch Afflictions as a Chriſtian ſuffers for the goſpel and for the name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle triumpheth in this, 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 20. That Chriſt ſhould be <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in his body, whether by life or death;</hi> and therefore ſpeaks of his ſufferings of this nature, as the matter of his expectation, his hope, his boldneſs, and what he was confident he ſhould not be aſhamed of: and he prayeth for a fellowſhip with Chriſt in his ſufferings, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Ignatius</hi> is reported after all his ſufferings to have ſaid, <hi>Now I begin to be a diſciple. Now</hi> (ſaith <hi>Anthony Perſon</hi> a Martyr of our own Nation) <hi>I am dreſſed like a Souldier of Chriſt,</hi> when he had put ſome of the ſtraw that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to kindle the wood which was to burn him, <hi>on the top of his Head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But, <hi>All ſorts of afflictions have an influence upon the Soul to make it more like to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Sufferings in the fleſh for <hi>Chriſts ſake</hi> make us conformable to Chriſts fleſh, to Chriſt in his ſtate of humiliation, to Chriſt upon the Croſs, but all the Afflictions of the Saints conduce to make them like unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his holineſs, and purity, that now belongeth unto Chriſt, and is inſeparable from him in his eſtate of glory, and exaltation: in that he died, he died once and but once, and ſhall hang on the Croſs no more, wear a Crown of thorns no more, but his purity and holineſs, that is eſſential to him: now the Afflictions of Gods people make them like unto Chriſt in this. This is an argument which I have had occaſion before to touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore I ſhall be the ſhorter in it now.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="593" facs="tcp:192227:325"/>1. <hi>They wonderfully conduce to take the hearts of the people of God off from the Earth, and to ſix them upon Heaven.</hi> Poverty takes off the heart from the love of riches, and delivereth it from an evil covetouſneſs; <hi>ſickneſs</hi> weaneth the Soul from the <hi>love of this life.</hi> Now holineſs lieth ſo much in the Sequeſtration of the heart from the world, that in <hi>Greek,</hi> an <hi>holy man</hi> ſignifies a man that is not earthly. it is an hard thing for a man to be poſſeſſed of much of the Earth, and not to have his heart buried in it: it is true we ſhould <hi>rejoyce as if we rejoyced not,</hi> and <hi>poſſeſs as if we poſſeſſed not;</hi> but this is <hi>an hard ſaying</hi> to fleſh and blood, Who is there almoſt who can hear, who can learn it? how rare is that Soul which liveth in the full fruition of the things of this life, that can yet keep his heart looſe from them, and ſequeſtred for God? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, plenty, a great affluence of the good things of this life are as birdlime to a Souls wings, and keep it from mounting up to God. I remember it is a ſaying of <hi>Salvian, Repugnanti corporis valetudine quae optamus facere non facimus;</hi> many a time, the want of ſtrength, and health in our bodies, hindreth us from doing that ſin which we have a mind to commit. The great enjoyments of the world are not only the things which make men unwilling to die, but both they, and the great buſineſſes and employments of the world, are thoſe things which keep Chriſtians fettered; they cannot pray, they cannot wait upon God in ordinances, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faſt, they cannot ſolemnly worſhip God as others leſs intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led can: amongſt other advantages therefore of a poor and afflicted ſtate an ingenious Author reckons this for one, he ſaith it is <hi>purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis condimentum,</hi> the pickle of purity and holineſs. They are the very ſalt of the Earth, without which the beſt of men would putrify in their full enjoyment. They are (you know) ſharp, and acrimonious things, that are the Enemies to putrefaction: ſalt ſeaſoneth things, vinegar makes a good pickle preſervative of things <hi>Sugar</hi> quickly corrupteth. It is true there are too too many that have little enough of theſe things, and as little of any gracious habits, poverty, and afflictions will not give grace; but that is a rare Chriſtian that abounds with the affluences of this life, and yet keepeth his integrity, is as pure, as holy, as full of duty, as others who have leſs of this worlds goods; they are no fountains of grace, but they are great preſervatives of it.</p>

Nay this is not all; in the ſecond place, <hi>they conduce much to the improvements of grace, eſpecially of faith and patience.</hi> They are two habits of grace, that like <hi>Solomons</hi> brother and friend are made for adverſity. <hi>Tribulatio patientiae Robur operatur, patientia fidei probationem parit.</hi> Tribulation addeth to the ſtrength of patience; and patience <hi>bringeth forth the tryal of Faith.</hi> If the people of God never met with affliction, how ſhould the trial of their faith appear <hi>more pretious than that of Gold which periſheth?</hi> How ſhould <hi>their patience have its perfect work?</hi> Faith is never ſeen till we be out of ſight of the thing which we pretend to truſt God for. <hi>Hope which is ſeen is no hope, but if we hope for that which we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it. Job</hi>'s faith in God, and love to God, was ſeen in his truſting in him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to him while God ſeemed to be killing of him. Practical habits are improved by exerciſe. The Souls of the Saints or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily come out of their trials, more ſtrong in faith, more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in hope, more exerciſed in patience, more flaming in love to God; how then ſhall we call thoſe things evils which inſtead of depraving the Soul and making it worſe, do tend to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul and making of it <hi>better?</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, the higheſt good which the Soul is capable of is, <hi>the beatifical viſion, and enjoyment of God to all Eternity.</hi> To this the low eſtate of the people of God doth exceedingly conduce, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Our light Affliction, which is but for a moment, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Thoſe who ſhall ſit with God upon thrones, are thoſe <hi>which continue with him in tribulations.</hi> The <hi>great multitude</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. which no man could <hi>number, of all Nations, kindreds, people, and tongues, which ſtood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes and palms in their hands,</hi> upon inquiry were found to be thoſe <hi>who came out of great tribulation, and had waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,</hi> v. 14. Our ſufferings in this life do not merit glory, alas there is no <hi>perfection</hi> in our ſuffering, and ſufferings are but our duty; nor is there any proportion, betwixt <hi>light and momentany afflictions,</hi> and a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; but they work for us a far more exceeding weight of glory. Thou art miſtaken then, O Chriſtian in thy Judgment. God doth not (as thou dreameſt) diſtribute good things to his Enemies, nor yet
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:192227:326"/>evil things to his friends: the buſineſs is no more than this, <hi>Deus per ficta mala punit ſuos, &amp; per larvata bona impios remunerat. Nierem.</hi> 
                     <q>God indeed by things in appearance good rewardeth wicked men, and by things in appearance evil he puniſheth thoſe that are his own people.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor let any one think to quibble here, as if God mocked either the one or the other, for although theſe things which the wicked enjoy, are not <hi>real</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial good things;</hi> yet as they are the things which they deſire, delight in, which they chuſe above other things more ſolidly, and ſubſtantially good, they are to them really good, and they have a tendency to make them better; and the afflictions of the people of God, as they have in them an enmity to their fleſh, and are ingrateful to their ſenſes, ſo they have ſomething of real evil in them; but comparatively with other evils, or the greater good things which God hath prepared for his people, they have nothing of evil in them. In ſhort, every obſerving man diſcerneth the difference betwixt the love of an indulgent cockering mother, and a wiſe, and prudent father. The father ſheweth his love to the Child, by fitting it to live in the world another day, learning it to be a man, to know the world, and to converſe with it: to this purpoſe, he inureth it to hardſhip, he ſends it to ſchool, and keepeth it under a ſevere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: thus he ſheweth his love to his Child, and when the Child cometh to years of diſcretion the Child thanks him for it, though under the diſcipline of its youth poſſibly the Child thinks the father its worſt enemy. The mother poſſibly ſheweth her love by cockering the Child, dandling it upon her knee, providing fine clothes for it, giving it ſweet-meats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which things indeed have nothing of true love in them, and do only tend to emaſculate the Child, and make it of an effeminate temper, and more unfit to converſe with, or live in the world another day. <hi>Patrium Deus habet in bonos animum,</hi> (ſaith an ingenious Author) God loves good people, not like a mother but like a father: <hi>whom he loveth he chaſtneth, and ſcourgeth every Child whom he receiveth;</hi> he keeps them at the ſchool of affliction, and educateth them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſcipline of the rods, and <hi>ferulaes</hi> of many trials, and afflictions: he ſuffereth not the world which is their natural mother according to the fleſh, to hug them in her boſom, nor to dandle them upon her knees; he chaſteneth them that they might not be
<pb facs="tcp:192227:327"/>condemned with the wicked; he hath ſaid, <hi>bleſſed is he whom thou chaſteneth, and teacheſt him out of thy Law.</hi> This is but a fatherly dealing of God with his people. God thus fitteth them for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, poliſheth them for ſhafts in his own quiver, by this darkneſs makes them fit for the Saints in light. Why ſayeſt thou, O Chriſtian, that the Lords ways are not equal, or that the Lord dealeth hardly with thee? God dealeth with thee, but as every wiſe and prudent father dealeth with the Child of his deareſt love: and thus I have ſpoken to two of the Queſtions which fall under this head. But there is yet a third would be ſpoken to, and the rather, becauſe it may be a temptation that ſeized the hearts of many of Gods people in former times, that is, <hi>How it conſiſteth with the juſtice, wiſdom, and goodneſs of God in the motions of his Providence to make the vileſt, and worſt of men his Inſtruments to chaſten the beſt, and deareſt of his own people:</hi> it was <hi>Habbakuks</hi> complaint, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>why holdeſt thou thy peace, when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he, and maketh men as fiſhes of the Sea, as the creeping things which have no ruler over them?</hi> But that will be my next Text, where I ſhall ſpeak ſomething rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to that diſpenſation of God, and afterwards ſhall more largely apply both what I have ſpoken, and what I ſhall further ſpeak on this Argument.</p>

                     <q>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookeſt thou on them that deal treacherouſly and holdeſt thy Tongue, when the wicked man devoureth the man that is more righteous than he; And makeſt men as the Fiſh of the Sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Begin (as you ſee) where I left in my laſt exerciſe. I left with a quotation out of the prophecy of <hi>Habbakuk</hi> which is now my Text, nor could any thing be more proper; for you ſee it containeth in terms the Queſtion I am this day ſpeaking to. In the beginning of this Chapter and Prophecy, the Prophet had been complaining unto God of the exceeding wickedneſs, and incorrigibleneſs of the <hi>Jews.</hi> God replying to him had told him, what poſſibly he did not expect (deſiring not the ruin but refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his people) that he was about to put an end to their wickedneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 6. Raiſing up the <hi>Caldeans a bitter and haſty nation, which ſhould</hi> march through the breadth of the land, to poſſeſs the dwellings which were not theirs; <hi>terrible,</hi> and <hi>dreadful,</hi> &amp;c. An enemy every way qualified to execute Gods utmoſt vengeance upon this people. This quite ſurpriſeth and aſtoniſheth the good prophet, and ſends him in haſt unto God again, <hi>v.</hi> 13. ſaith he, <hi>Art not thou from everlaſting, O Lord my God, mine holy one? we ſhall not dye, O Lord, thou haſt ordained them for Judgment, and O mighty God thou haſt eſtabliſhed them for correction;</hi> then follow the words of my Text, <hi>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity: wherefore lookeſt thou on them that deal treacherouſly, and holdeſt thy tongue, when the wicked devoureth the
<pb facs="tcp:192227:328"/>man, that is more righteous then he? Habbakuk</hi> lookt upon this as a very ſad diſpenſation, and what ſtumbled him as to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, therefore he puts it in that phraſe, <hi>the man that is more righteous than he,</hi> and addeth, <hi>and makeſt men as the fiſhes of the Sea, as creeping things of the Earth which have no ruler over them.</hi> Thoſe brute ſenſitive creatures are not ruled by any rules of juſtice or righteouſneſs; thoſe of them that have moſt natural <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> devour thoſe who have leſs: but now men are reaſonable creatures, and ſhould be acted by principles of reaſon and juſtice amongſt them, <hi>might</hi> ſhould not overcome <hi>right.</hi> But, O Lord, in this diſpenſation of thy Providence thou ſeemeſt to govern the reaſonable part of the world like the brutiſh, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive part of it. The <hi>Jews</hi> though they be a ſinful people, yet they are more <hi>righteous</hi> than the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> they are a brutiſh people and have no right againſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> ſhall thy Providence ſo order the affaires of the world, that thoſe who have moſt power in their hand, though they have no right, ſhall trample down thy people, and eat them up like bread? Lord! this were to make men like <hi>the fiſh of the Sea, like the creeping things</hi> of the Earth, which have none over them, to govern them by any rules of juſtice or righteouſneſs. Lord, why doth thy Providence thus govern humane affaires? This I conceive the ſenſe of the words. The queſtion which remains to be ſpoken to is this.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How it can conſiſt with the Juſtice of God in the motions of his Actual Providence to ſuffer wicked men to devour thoſe who are more righteous than themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am the more willing to ſpeak to this becauſe it is a diſpenſation under which many, of thoſe that fear the Lord in this nation have ſuffered: we have ſeen good men rifled, their goods taken from them, we cannot ſay but they have deſerved this, and far more than this from the hand of Divine Juſtice; but though they have deſerved this, yet we are ready to think it is hard that they ſhould ſuffer this from ſuch <hi>miſcreants</hi> as take the Spoil, and God will certainly one day fetch <hi>the blood of his people and their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations out of their mouths.</hi> We are prone to think that God ſhould not ſuffer his people to be devoured, by thoſe who are more unrighteous then they are. The Text gives you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="596" facs="tcp:192227:328"/>1. <hi>Of a great diſorder in the world,</hi> at leaſt a diſpenſation of Providence which <hi>Habakkuk</hi> thought ſo. <hi>Men dealt treacherouſly; the wicked devoured the men who were more righteous than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It gives you an account of Gods carriage under this diſorder. God looked upon men,</hi> that is, he ſeemed to <hi>look upon the men that dealt treacherouſly, and to hold his peace</hi> while <hi>Sinners devoured the more righteous perſons.</hi> God by the motions of his Providence ſeemed rather to favour, than frown upon theſe diſorders. Hence might be obſerved theſe two propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Prop. <hi>That it is no unuſual diſpenſation of Providence for God to ſuffer the wicked to devour thoſe that are more righteous than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>That this diſpenſation hath been matter of ſtumbling, and a very ſore temptation even to the ſervants of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt as to matter of fact there is nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable, look over the whole Hiſtory of Scripture, the Hiſtory of all times, you will find it true; the world began with <hi>Cains</hi> killing <hi>Abel,</hi> it went on with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the <hi>Babilonians</hi> devouring of the only people which God had in the world. Now I ſay this hath been heretofore, and doubtleſs is at this time a great temptation to Gods people. <hi>Habakkuk</hi> complains of it in the Text. <hi>Job</hi> complained, <hi>Job</hi> 30.1. <hi>That thoſe who were younger than he had him in deriſion, even thoſe whoſe Fathers he would have diſdained to have ſet with the dogs of his table. Shemei</hi> a dead dog, as he called him, curſed <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Informer</hi> prevails againſt all the Lords Prieſts, <hi>Judas</hi> another <hi>Informer</hi> devoureth him who is the Lord of life. It is a diſpenſation that hath often put the ſervants of God into unſeemly paſſions, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> would have had <hi>fire come down from Heaven</hi> as in <hi>Elijahs</hi> time, to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the <hi>Samaritans. Peter</hi> was out of patience to ſee the <hi>Informer</hi> come with a company, with <hi>Swords and Staves to take his Maſter,</hi> and in his paſſion draweth a Sword, and with it cuts off the ear of the ſervant of the high prieſt. <hi>David</hi> himſelf when God offered him the choice of three Judgments, deſired <hi>rather to fall into the hands of God than into the hands of men.</hi> I ſay it is
<pb facs="tcp:192227:329"/>and hath often been a very ſore temptation, advantaged partly from Nature, partly from ſome Religious reflections.</p>
                  <p>That which in <hi>humane nature advantageth this temptation, is,</hi> 1. The <hi>diſdain every man naturally hath to ſuffer an injury from one beneath himſelf:</hi> when <hi>Gideon</hi> would have had his Son <hi>Jether,</hi> have fallen upon thoſe two Eaſtern Princes <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalmuna,</hi> they ſaid riſe thou up, and fall upon us; men have a natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and ſcorn to ſuffer from their inferiours, we ſee it in every days experience. Now although every child of God is low in his own eyes, and in honour preferreth every Saint before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes <hi>magnified his office</hi> againſt the falſe Apoſtles, and counterfeits of his age, though he judged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the leaſt of the Apoſtles, and unworthy of that great Name: ſo they cannot but <hi>magnifie themſelves,</hi> in compariſon of open profane miſcreants, that are the ſcum, and off ſcouring of the place in which they live; ſuch as are common drunkards, lyars, ſwearers, Sabbath-breakers, and guilty of other debaucheries, the very ſcabs of the body politick, and ſpots of the Aſſemblies to which they are united.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Every man naturally hath a <hi>regret at the receiving of injuries from thoſe from whom he hath deſerved no ſuch thing.</hi> Now the People of God are perſons of innocence, who have done no wrong to their worſt Enemies; they have loved their Enemies, prayed for them, been ready to do any offices of love to them, and know not how to bear an injury from thoſe to whom they have done no wrong. This was that which troubled <hi>Davids</hi> Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.12, 13. <hi>They rewarded me evil for good to the ſpoiling of my Soul, but as for me when they were ſick, my cloathing was ſackcloath, I humbled my Soul with faſting, and my prayer returned into my own boſom; I behaved myſelf as though he had been my friend, or brother, I bowed down heavily, as one that mourned for my mother. But in mine adverſity they rejoyced, and gathered themſelves together, yea the abjects gathered themſelves together againſt me, and I knew it not; yea they did tear me, and ceaſed not, with hypocritical mockers at feaſts they gnaſhed upon me with their teeth. Lord how long wilt thou look on? Reſcue my Soul from their deſtructions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This temptation is likewiſe advantaged from ſome <hi>Religious reflections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. From a reflection upon the purity, <hi>and holineſs of God. O Lord</hi> (ſaith our Prophet in my Text,) <hi>thou art of purer Eyes
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:192227:329"/>then to behold iniquity.</hi> How a juſt and pure and holy God ſhould <hi>look on,</hi> and <hi>hold his peace</hi> to ſee a company of vile wretches tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and devouring his own people, this is a knowledg (at firſt view) too wonderful for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From a reflexion <hi>upon the promiſes and threatnings of God;</hi> they look into the holy word of God, and find that full of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of good to Gods People, of threatnings of wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to wicked men; inſtead of this, they ſee vile men building up Palaces to themſelves upon their ruins, and adorning themſelves with their Ornaments; the houſes of the profane furniſhed, and adorned with that which is not theirs; inſtead of the wicked mans preparing garments, and the juſt mans putting them on (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh) they ſee good and righteous men preparing garments, and leud and ungodly men put them on; they ſee the ſpoil of ſuch as fear the Lord in the tents of leud and ungodly men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From a reflexion upon the Decrees of God: <hi>O Lord,</hi> (ſaith our Prophet) <hi>thou haſt ordained them for deſtruction; O mighty God, thou haſt eſtabliſhed them for correction:</hi> they conſider leud and wicked men, as men whom God by a fixed act of his Will hath ordained to judgment, as perſons who by the <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> counſel of God are to be deſtroyed, and they cannot expound the Providence of God into a conſiſtency with his eternal purpoſe, when they ſee them not only live, proſper, and grow old, but alſo live by the death of ſuch as fear God, and build their neſts on high with feathers which they have plucked from their wings. From theſe, and other cauſes, ariſeth this trouble and coil in the ſpirits of Gods people. <hi>Fluctus eſt, Tentatio eſt</hi> (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) it is a great wave, a great temptation and trouble; and even Gods own people here, are ready to think they ſee a knot in the thred of providence, a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in the even ways of the Lords dealing. Let me indeavour in a few words to unty this knot, to remove this ſtone. Four or five things I ſhall ſpeak, one or other of which, or all together, will make this way of the Lord plain to every ſober and underſtanding Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>How is God to his people more hard, or unrighteous in ſuch a diſpenſation, than he was to the ſon of his deareſt love?</hi> Our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord hath taught us, <hi>That the Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the ſervant above his Lord; it is enough for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple that he be as his Maſter, and the Servant as his Lord,</hi> Matt.
<pb facs="tcp:192227:330"/>10.24, 25. 'Tis true, the chief <hi>Informer</hi> againſt our Lord, was one of his hoſhold, <hi>Judas;</hi> but he was <hi>a ſon of perdition,</hi> the only ill member of all the 12. Who were <hi>his witneſſes,</hi> but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of perjured wretches, who could not agree in their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? Who mockt him and ſcourged him? <hi>Herod,</hi> a monſter for all manner of wickedneſs. Who were they that ſpit upon him; that cried out <hi>crucifie him, crucifie him;</hi> that gave him Gall and Vinegar to drink? were they not the <hi>abjects of the people?</hi> Thou art not able to conceive of Gods righteouſneſs, in giving thee over, and thy eſtate over to a Renegado, an apoſtate from his former profeſſion, to wretches who make no conſcience what they ſay, what they ſwear, what they do: How was he righteous in giving over the Son of his love to ſuch wretches? We are never ſo like to our Lord and Maſter, as when we are betrayed by a <hi>Judas,</hi> informed againſt, and teſtified againſt by falſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured wretches, mockt and abuſed by the abjects and off ſcouring of the people: If God might be a juſt and righteous God in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering theſe things to be done to the green tree, ſurely he may ſuffer them to be done unto us who are dry trees. Thou art troubled that God ſhould ſuffer profane ſcoffers to call thee hypocrite, and haſt a temptation to think God is not juſt to thee in ſuffering it; knoweſt, or remembreſt thou not <hi>what contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſinners Chriſt endured,</hi> how they ſaid of him, that he did caſt out Devils, by <hi>Beelzebub the Prince of Devils?</hi> When thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit riſeth againſt thy adverſaries, oh think of Chriſt who was the Captain of all our Salvation. But further yet,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Before thou in thy thoughts paſſeſt ſentence againſt God and his righteouſneſs, conſider with thy ſelf <hi>by whom wouldeſt thou have God to chaſtiſe his people?</hi> It is written That <hi>all who will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi> Now ſuppoſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution one of thoſe <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kinds of affliction which, God hath a liberty to Scourge, and chaſten his people by; Who ſhould be the perſecutors? couldeſt thou expect that the <hi>ſeed of the woman</hi> ſhould <hi>break the womans head?</hi> That ſuch who have taſted of the love of God, ſhould bite and devour one another? Indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (through the prevalence of luſts and paſſions) it proves ſo through miſtakes, and ſuch miſapprehenſions as the beſt are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to and this but in particular rare caſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But it <hi>ſuteth not the ingenuous nature of Gods people to do injury to others:</hi> Indeed it ſuteth not any perſons (though of
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:192227:330"/>little acquaintance with God) if they be perſons of any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ingenuity of nature; you ſee amongſt us, none but one ſaved from the Gallows for that purpoſe, will be a common hangman: we ſee how ordinary perſons they muſt be that will be perſwaded to be Bayliffs; but now to fall upon the Lords Prieſts is a work only fit for an accurſed <hi>Edomite.</hi> The Child of God is yet under a further Law than that of a good nature, he is here taught of God to do good to all, to love his enemies, to do good to them that hate him; to love and pray for thoſe who hate him and deſpightfully uſe him; he is ſo far from requiting <hi>evil</hi> for <hi>evil,</hi> that he taketh himſelf obliged to return good for evil: Now it is not reaſonable to think that God ſhould make uſe of his own people, who are by himſelf taught the clean contrary; and are obliged by a contrary law, which they have ſo far imbibed, that it is written on their hearts, and ingraven in their ſouls, to puniſh and chaſten his own children. Who ever ſet a Sheep to worry a Sheep? The work of informing againſt, accuſing, chaſtening, ſcourging the people of God, is a work fit for none but profane wretches, drunkards, ſwearers, the debauchees of the world, who have in them ſuch a radicated hatred of God, and ſuch an antipathy to that holineſs which is fountain'd in him; that like as the Baſilisk, they ſay, will fly upon the picture of a man, out of its antipathy to humane nature, they will fly upon every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that hath the image and ſuperſcription of God upon his ſoul, and is called by the holy name of God: it is a work that only fitteth thoſe whoſe hearts are poſſeſſed with the poyſon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, and all ſuperfluity of wickedneſs. To do injury to others, ſuteth not an ingenious nature in any perſon; but it much leſs ſuteth the Sanctified nature of a Child of God: few creatures will prey upon their own kind. If a Child of God be to be rent and torn in pieces, to be chaſtened and ſcourged by men, that he may not be condemned in the world; there are none ſo fit to do it, as the Dogs and Swine in the world. I would ask of thee (ſaith an excellent Author) who art under ſuch a temptation as this, Wouldſt thou have the Saints of God perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, impriſon, plunder, deſtroy one another? Surely they would then loſe their Majeſty of vertue, their title of Saints. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing then the work muſt be done; it is as reaſonable to conclude, that it muſt be done by thoſe who are leſs righteous then they are;

                  <p n="2">2. Give the Lord, I beſeech you, leave <hi>to make ſome uſe of the very worſt of men.</hi> It is the ſaying of an acute Author, <hi>Cur non ex perditis hominibus hoc lucraretur Deus, &amp;c.</hi> Why ſhould not God make this profit of the vileſt men? It is true, it is not all the ſervice which God makes wicked men do; but give me leave to tell you, it is one of the greateſt pieces of ſervice God hath from them; they are left in the Land, as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were left in <hi>Canaan, Judg.</hi> 2.3, to be <hi>Thorns</hi> in the ſides of Gods <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to keep the Lords Gaols and Bridewell, his houſes of correction for his people. Take a profane vile wretch, he hath his being from God, and his well-being he hath from God, he eateth Gods bread, and is clothed with Gods wool and flax; What hath God for all this? He ſwears profanely, he blaſphemeth God prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, he breaks the Lords Sabbaths, God is diſhonoured by him every day. This ſervice he hath from them, when he hath a Child to be whipped, he turns him over to him; God makes the ſame uſe of wicked men he doth of the <hi>Devils,</hi> they are his peoples <hi>tempters</hi> and <hi>tormentors.</hi> Wicked men are to God, as the Dog to the <hi>Shepherd,</hi> as the <hi>Hawk or Bird of prey to the Faulkener;</hi> God uſeth them, to let them fly at his own people ſometimes, and to pick out the eyes of them who are as dear to him as the Apples of his eye. The <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> in the world ſignifieth little to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, but as as he ſerveth well enough to make a <hi>Rod for his anger,</hi> and a <hi>ſtaff for his indignation,</hi> to be ſent againſt an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Nation, which God can no longer bear with, but is at laſt reſolved to make the people of his wrath.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The worſt of men muſt be ſuffered <hi>to fill up the meaſures of their iniquities;</hi> you know God told <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the iniquity of the <hi>Amorites was not yet full;</hi> God will have ſinners fill up their meaſures. Now, there is no ſuch way for wicked men to fill up the meaſures of their ſins, and make themſelves ripe, full ripe for Divine vengeance, as for them to fall upon this work of devouring the Servants of God, who are more righteous than themſelves are. I have a good authority for it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.34, <hi>Wherefore, behold, I ſend unto you Prophets, and wiſe men, and ſcribes, and ſome of them you ſhall kill and crucifie, and ſome you ſhall ſcourge in your ſynagogues, and perſecute them from city to
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:192227:331" rendition="simple:additions"/>city, that upon you may come all the righteous blood that hath been ſhed upon the Earth, from the blood of Abel, to the blood of Zechariah,</hi> &amp;c. Mark what went before, verſ. 32. <hi>Fill you up then the meaſure of your Fathers; you Serpents, you generation of Vipers, how can you eſcape the damnation of Hell.</hi> As the Child of God muſt finiſh his work which God hath given him to do; ſo the reprobate muſt fill up his meaſures too. It may be a poor wretch hath been a ſwearer, a Sabbath-breaker, a drunkard, an unclean perſon, many years; God hath born with him, let him alone, there want yet ſome drops to fill up the meaſures of his ſin, he falls upon the people of God, turns a perſecutor, ſmiteth his fellow-ſervants with the fiſt of violence and wickedneſs; then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the maſter of that ſervant in an hour when he looketh not for him, and preſently giveth him his portion with Hypocrites, where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth: of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences muſt come, they will come, but wo be to thoſe by whom they come. Methinks there is a great <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>That upon you may come all the righteous blood that hath been ſhed upon the earth, from the blood of</hi> Abel, &amp;c. There was a great deal of righteous blood ſhed from the time of <hi>Abel</hi> to the time of <hi>Zechariah:</hi> what had God let it all ſleep? had God in thoſe hundreds of years reckoned with ſinners for none of it? Yes, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God had revenged himſelf of many a blood-thirſty man. But yet <hi>Abels</hi> blood was not expiated in Chriſts time; there was yet an arrear of reckoning for <hi>Abels</hi> blood. Well, who ſhall pay for it? even every one that was <hi>Cains</hi> ſucceſſor in that kind of ſin. You read no ſuch expreſſion in Holy-writ with reference to any other ſin. This ſin, this devouring of perſons more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous than our ſelves, hath many grains of guilt in it more than any other ſins have; men by it fill up the meaſure of the ſins of a Nation, and they fill up the meaſure of their own perſonal ſins. It is a ſaying (as I remember) of <hi>Auguſtines, Nemo habet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtum lucrum ſine juſto damno, lucrum habet in arca damnum in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia.</hi> 
                     <q>No man getteth any unjuſt gain without a juſt loſs; his gain is laid up in his cheſt, but his loſs is in his Conſcience; he gets a penny or two into his purſe, but a ſeal of damnation in his ſoul.</q> I am ſure all the gains any get by devouring the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are more righteous than themſelves, is an unjuſt gain. Yea, though God gives it them, it is unjuſt gain; God is but permiſſive in the caſe, and Gods permiſſion doth not ſalve them, but that
<pb facs="tcp:192227:332"/>they are <hi>poſſeſſores malae fidei.</hi> God gave the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> and other enemies of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the prey they took from the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet he often calls it by his Prophets, <hi>that which is not theirs:</hi> the loſs is in their Conſciences, they are hardned to deſtruction, ſealed up to the condemnation of Hell: they fill up the meaſures of their iniquities by their violence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But laſtly, <hi>Why ſhould not God be righteous, in ſuffering wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men to do his people good?</hi> This is a point I have ſomething largely before ſpoken to, and therefore may be ſhorter in this Diſcourſe: <hi>proſunt &amp; gelu, &amp; nix quia incommodant</hi> (ſaith one); they do them good, by doing them hurt, as ſnow and froſt do good to the Corn. The Apoſtle tells the people of God, that <hi>all things are theirs,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21. that is, for their good, profit, and advantage; and again, <hi>All things work together for the good of them that love God.</hi> The dignity of the people of God is ſuch, that not only <hi>bruit beaſts,</hi> but bruitiſh men (St. <hi>Pauls Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an beaſts</hi>) ſhall be harneſſed for their ſervice in order to their eternal ſalvation; and if the Angels be miniſtring ſpirits for the good of Gods elect, it is no wonder if the children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil be beaſts miniſtring for their ſervice too. They ſay <hi>Veſpaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> had a wretched ſaying, that the <hi>ſmell of mony was ſweet from whenceſoever it came.</hi> I am ſure the odor of grace is ſweet, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever be inſtrumental for the ſending it forth. The truth is, what the wiſer Philoſophers ſaid of a <hi>morally good</hi> and <hi>wiſe man,</hi> is much more true of one ſpiritually wiſe and good; <hi>He is out of the jurisdiction of evil. Seneca</hi> ſaith, that a <hi>wiſe man cannot be contemned of any, quia magnitudinem ſuam novit, becauſe he knoweth his own riches.</hi> A gracious man can be impriſoned by none, becauſe he knows his own liberty, and will enjoy it when the world hath done what it can: he can be plundred by none, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth his own riches. It were a vaſt work to open to you how many wayes the perſecutions of the ſaints advantage and profit the people of God; but I have in ſome meaſure done it before, and ſhall not again further enlarge upon it. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle telleth you much in ſhort, when he telleth you, that <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope.</hi> I ſhall add no more to the Doctrinal part of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.</p>

Now hear, O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hear all you ſons and daughters of men, <hi>are not the Lords ways equal?</hi> Is not your judgment of them unequal? This is the great argument againſt Divine Providence, becauſe in the world there appeareth ſuch a confuſion of things, <hi>The wicked walk on every ſide, while vileſt men are exalted:</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane leud perſons, live, grow old, are rich, and great in power. The Sun (which ſeemeth to go down upon the Tabernacles of ſome that fear the Lord) ſhineth bright upon the Tabernacles of the ungodly; the people of God are afflicted, plundred, nay and (which ſeemeth hardeſt of all) the holieſt and beſt of men are devoured by the vileſt and moſt prophane wretches; this is that which is a ſore temptation to men, and makes them think that certainly there is no God who judgeth the world, or that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth not the affairs of the world; there is no ſtrength in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, no reaſon for ſuch a concluſion: the love or hatred of God is not to be concluded from any thing which is before us in this life, as with reference to actions, we call good evil, and evil good; ſo through the deceitfulneſs of our ſenſes, we miſcall things; we call thoſe things evil which ſeparate them from the affection of our ſenſe, have no evil in them; and things good which have no real goodneſs. Now the judgement of ſenſe is a very fallible judgement: do you ſee the wicked proſper, the godly man viſited every morning, and chaſtned every moment? come but up into the ſanctuary, and you will be able to unrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle this Providence: <hi>Job</hi> ſaw the wicked flouriſhing and taking root, but ſuddenly he curſed his habitation. You ſee the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent children of God impriſoned, plundred, <hi>&amp;c.

What you have heard upon this argument, <hi>looketh ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſtly upon every proſperous ſinner which this day heareth me, and boaſteth in his large poſſeſſions of the good things of this life.</hi> The ſum of what you have heard is, that the things which you glory in are not truly good; that they are but temporary rewards or gifts of God; that they are means to bring you to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of God; that oft-times through mens corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they prove the means of their greater ruine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, How ſhould this <hi>take down a ſinners plumes.</hi> Let not the great man glory in his greatneſs, nor the rich man in his riches. Let not any ſay in his heart, if God had not a favour to me, he would never give me ſuch an eſtate, ſuch a ſucceſs in my trade, ſuch an healthy body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The method of Providence is quite contrary. I have ſomewhere met with a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that anciently according to the laws of <hi>Perſia,</hi> a malefactor had liberty for an hour before he died to ask what he would, and it was not denied to him. One they ſay condemned to dye, and being according to their cuſtom askt what he would deſire, anſwers, Neither this nor that, but only <hi>That I may ſee the Kings face;</hi> which being granted, he ſo plied the King in that hour, as that he obtained his pardon; whereupon they ſay that the <hi>Perſians</hi> altered their cuſtom, and <hi>covered</hi> the Malefactors face as ſoon as he was condemned, that he might ſee the King no more. God to thouſands of ſinners gives what their hearts could wiſh, riches, honours, pleaſures, they are poor condemned wretches by the law of God for all this, veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when the hour-glaſs of their life in this world is run out, they are to be <hi>turned into Hell,</hi> to depart from God as accurſed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into thoſe everlaſting burnings that are prepared for the Devil and his Angels. Only God, that all his creatures might taſt ſomething of his bounty, for that hour giveth them all good things of this life; had it not now been a ſilly and unreaſonable thing, ſuppoſe the Malefactor had asked for, and had a Houſe full of Gold or Silver, or all the great titles the world could have dignified him with, to have <hi>gloried</hi> and boaſted of them as tokens of the Kings love, when in the mean time he knew he was a poor condemned wretch, and by and by to be cut off from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them all. Is not this the very caſe? thou knoweſt thy ſelf to be a drunkard, a ſwearer, a liar, an unclean perſon; thou
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:192227:333"/>knoweſt that for theſe courſes the righteous law of a righteous God hath condemned thee; it ſaith ſuch perſons ſhall never ſee God, ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God, but be thrown into the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone: God out of his bounty gives thee for the few hours thou haſt to live out of Hell, health, riches, honours, pleaſures, all thy heart can wiſh in the world: haſt thou any reaſon to boaſt thy ſelf in theſe things, or to be proud of them? thy condition is infinitely worſe than the <hi>Philoſopher's,</hi> that could eat no dainties at the Kings Table, becauſe he ſaw a naked ſword hang over his head by a twine-thread. Certainly (poor wretch!) it were thy wiſdom for this little time of thy life, to do as it is ſaid that Malefactor in <hi>Perſia</hi> did, deſpiſe all things, and only deſire thou mighteſt apply thy ſelf for the little time of thy life with tears, faſting and prayer to God, that thou mighteſt ſee his face, and obtain the pardon of thy ſins through the blood of Chriſt. Poor wretches! what (in the mean time) have you to glory in? what have you to be proud of? What ſhould make you walk with a ſtretched-out neck, or a lofty eye? thou art not maſter of one good thing; thou calleſt them good, becauſe they are grateful to thy ſenſe, and pleaſe thy ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive appetite; and they are ſo far good as they ſerve thy outward neceſſities, but of no ſignificancy at all, either to thy ſpiritual or eternal happineſs. Yet theſe are the things which make the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man proud, ſwelling in an high opinion of himſelf, deſpiſing others. Oh! that God would make you underſtand, that you have not only periſhing fleſhly bodies, to be covered with ſoft and gay cloathing, but immortal ſouls; that you are creatures under an ordination to an eternal exiſtence, and that nothing can be worth naming as <hi>good,</hi> but what will profit you as to your immortal capacity, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man if he ſhould gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> Or what can a man give in exchange or ranſome for it. You have heard of a Prince that in his extremity of thirſt, cried out, <hi>a Kingdom for a draught of water.</hi> The time will come when every impenitent ſinner ſhall wiſh that he had not had a foot of land in the world, nor a rag to cover his nakedneſs, ſo be it that he had had the pardon of his ſins, and the robes of Chriſts righteouſneſs to cover the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſoul. Let him therefore that glorieth, glory in this, that God is his Lord, and Jeſus Chriſt is his Saviour.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:192227:334"/>2. This ſpeaketh to the proſperous ſinner, as <hi>not to be high-minded,</hi> becauſe he hath nothing to be proud of; <hi>ſo to fear,</hi> and to keep, and enjoy what he hath with fear and trembling. <hi>James</hi> would have the <hi>Rich man rejoice when he is brought low;</hi> Jam. 1.10. <hi>Becauſe as the flower of the graſs he paſſeth away:</hi> and when he hath loſt his riches, his honour, his outward felicity, he hath loſt all: but here are greater reaſons yet, <hi>becauſe by a proſperous condition,</hi> oftentimes, <hi>poenalis nutritur impunitas,</hi> a penal impunity is nouriſhed. <hi>Proſperity ſlayeth the fools,</hi> and ſinners are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily by it fatted and prepared for the day of ſlaughter. <hi>David</hi> ſaw that God ſet the proſperous ſinner in <hi>ſlippery places:</hi> upon <hi>Pinacles</hi> and <hi>Towers;</hi> but ſlippery places: you obſerve that the bloughtineſs (as you call it of the body) is but an ill ſign of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthineſs; the ſinners growing fat in outward enjoyments, I am ſure, is no good ſign, Pſal. 73.17, 18, 19. <hi>Surely thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery places, thou caſteſt them down to deſtruction; how are they brought to deſtruction in a moment? they are utterly conſumed.</hi> If a child of God hath reaſon to rejoice when he is brought low, ſurely a ſinner hath reaſon to tremble when he is up on high. Godly men have uſed to be afraid of proſperity; it is an hard thing for the moſt watchful Chriſtian to keep his feet, when he is ſet upon the ſlippery mountain of riches, honour, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, <hi>&amp;c. David</hi> himſelf never had a ſlip like that he had when he came into the higheſt ſtate. Even the beſt of Gods people have great reaſon to rejoice with trembling in the midſt of full cups; but ſinners have far more reaſon; when they are not pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued as other men, when there are no bands in their death, when their eyes ſtand out with fatneſs, and they have more than heart could wiſh; that is the time when their mouths are <hi>ſet againſt Heaven,</hi> then <hi>their day of deſtruction is not far of;</hi> and indeed thoſe are the two dreadful conſiderations, and therefore they have reaſon to fear and tremble. 1. Leſt <hi>their proſperity ſhould ſlay their ſouls.</hi> There is a latent poyſon in ſinners hearts at all times, but poverty and adverſity keeps it in. <hi>The poor man uſeth intreaties</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon),</hi> but the rich man ſpeaketh proudly; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and power are great temptations to <hi>oppreſſion:</hi> Riches and abundance to all ſorts of <hi>Luxury.</hi> So as if a man be a <hi>fool,</hi> and hath no ſpiritual wiſdom to rule and to govern himſelf in a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſtate; his proſperity ſlayeth him, giving advantages to thoſe luſts that are in his heart to diſcover themſelves. It is the
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:192227:334"/>proſperous ſinner that oppreſſeth his neighbour, that does acts of injuſtice, and thinks by his power to defend himſelf. 2. Again, <hi>Proſperity bodes ill;</hi> The ſinner is never ſo near a fall as when he is upon a pinacle of honour and power. When the worldling ſaith, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for many years;</hi> then comes the voice, <hi>Thou fool! this night ſhall thy ſoul be taken from thee;</hi> and one reaſon of this is becauſe that is the time when his ſin ripeneth, when he lifteth up his heart higheſt, and openeth his mouth wideſt, and lifteth up his hands moſt fiercely againſt the God of Heaven. O then let the proſperous ſinner fear and tremble.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> You have heard that it is but a righteous thing with God, to give unto the worſt of men, the good things of this life, becauſe <hi>they have</hi> ſomething in them of <hi>the nature of means to convince ſinners, both of their ſins againſt God, and alſo of their duty to God:</hi> Indeed, they ordinarily prove the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but this is not of themſelves, or from their own nature; but from the luſt and corruption of ſinners hearts. <hi>O then let the goodneſs of God lead you to repentance,</hi> Rom. 2.4. The Apoſtle lets us know, that the patience, long-ſufferance, and goodneſs of God leads us to repentance. The long-ſuffering and patience of God, if there were no more, ought to do it: And certainly were there any ingenuity in the heart of a ſinner, it would do it. For him to ſit down and think, I have been a drunkard, a lyar, a ſwearer, a Sabbath-breaker theſe Twenty, Thirty, Forty years; God hath ſeen, and known me all this time, there hath not been a thought of my heart but hath been naked before him; I have not told a lye, nor ſworn an oath, but as ſoon as the word hath been out of my mouth, the news of it hath been in Heaven, and it hath been written in Gods Book of remembrance: God hath all this while been an Almighty God, and hath had it in his power every moment of this time to throw me to Hell. He could have ſtruck me dead with my lye in my mouth, as he did <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> Acts 5, or with my oath, my curſe, my blaſphemy in my mouth; but God hath been long-ſuffering and patient with me, willing that I ſhould at laſt be ſaved: Shall I yet go on in my ſinful courſes? Shall all this patience of God be loſt upon my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate ſoul? Surely I am bound humbly to acknowledg thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years of patience, and to ſin no more, leſt I turn Divine pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience into fury. But then the <hi>riches of Gods goodneſs,</hi> though
<pb facs="tcp:192227:335"/>it be but in the things of this life, adds great weight to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for a poor creature to ſit down, and think that he hath not been plagued as other men, he hath not had ſuch a ſickly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor ſuch a ſcant eſtate; but God hath made his cup to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, he hath had ſucceſs in his trading, whiles others have been blaſted. O ſhall not this goodneſs of God lead thee to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of God? Shall it not lead thee to a repentance for thy ſin? wilt thou treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the Revelation of the moſt righteous Judgment of God? Conſider that <hi>the good things thou haſt enjoyed,</hi> have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency to change thee, if thou hadſt not baniſhed that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ingenuity which teacheth all to love thoſe that love them; and moſt certainly it will make thee worſe, if not better: if it doth not ſoften thy heart, it will harden thy heart; if theſe things tend not to make thee more holy, they will certainly make thee more leud and profane. And think with thy ſelf what an aggravation of thy eternal miſery it will be, to fall into it, out of as high a ſtate of content and external felicity as thou wert ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. I would have every proſperous ſinner ſay with himſelf, <hi>What hath God done to me</hi> that I ſhould be thus vile, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly ſin againſt him? There are very many, that if they would liſten a little to their own conſciences, might hear God by them, ſpeaking to them, and ſaying, <hi>What could God have done more for you than he hath done?</hi> Would you have ſtrong and healthy bodies? God hath given you them. Would you have large poſſeſſions? great and plentiful eſtates? God hath given you ſuch. Would you have deſired a loving Wife, hopeful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? You have had them. God aggravateth the ſin of <hi>David</hi> from the outward bleſſings he had bleſſed him with; he had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> from following the ſheep; he had given him his Maſters Houſes, and his Maſters Wives into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. Will not God, think you, from hence aggravate your ſins another day? Will not this make Hell twice more Hell to you? will it not add more heat to the fire that never ſhall go out? and pain to the gnawings of that worm that ſhall never dye? Oh harden not your hearts; to day, while it is called to day hearken to God ſpeaking to you, not only by the voice of his Word, but by the voice of his Mercies. O let not that riches of Divine goodneſs make you worſe, which in reaſon ought to make you better. Let not your honours, your riches damn you.
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:192227:335"/>Take heed that there be not cauſe to ſay of you, that if God had not been ſo good to you, you had not been ſo leud and profane, ſo wicked and abominable in his ſight. Thus far I have applied this diſcourſe, as to wicked men; it remaineth yet, that I ſhould apply it as to the people of God, ſhewing them their duty under ſuch diſpenſations of providence; but it is a point fit in our times to be further enlarged upon, than my time will now allow me to do.</p>

                  <p>THe point I am upon, is to clear up the juſtice, equity, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of the motions of Gods Actual Providence, in the proſperity of wicked men, his afflictings and chaſtiſeings of his own people, and delivering them up into the hands of thoſe, who although the beſt of Gods People are ſinners, and deſerve the ſeverities of God, yet are more wicked, more unrighteous than they. This I have cleared, and made Application of my diſcourſe, ſo far as may concern wicked men; That which only yet remains, is to inform the People of God of their duty under ſuch a diſpenſation: This has been the caſe of God's people in former times; the eſtates at leaſt of many who truly fear God, and deſire to worſhip him according to his Will, have been expoſed to the vileſt men; and this may be a ſore temptation
<pb facs="tcp:192227:336"/>to Gods own people. I will therefore enlarge this diſcourſe a little, ſhewing you <hi>the duty</hi> of Gods People at ſuch a time, and for this I have choſen this Text. No other portion of Scripture ſo fully ſetting it out together, as the 7 or 8 firſt verſes of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which partly ſhew them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What they are to avoid.</hi> 2. And then <hi>what they are to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The prohibitive directions are three. 1. <hi>They muſt not fret,</hi> this is repeated three times, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of evil doers.</hi> v. 7. <hi>Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of him that proſpereth in his way, becauſe of the man that bringeth wicked devices, to paſs,</hi> v. 8. <hi>Fret not thy ſelf in any wiſe to do evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They muſt not be <hi>envious.</hi> v. 1. <hi>Neither be thou envious at the workers of iniquity.</hi> 3. They muſt not be angry. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Ceaſe from anger, forſake wrath.</hi> The inſtructive directions are four.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the <hi>exerciſe of faith.</hi> v. 3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord.</hi> v. 5. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord,</hi> truſt in him. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Reſt on the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is the practice of holineſs. 1. They muſt not do evil. <hi>v.</hi> 8. ſo <hi>v.</hi> 27. They muſt depart from evil. 2. They <hi>muſt do good.</hi> v. 3. v. 27. The ſame is repeated.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third is, They muſt <hi>delight themſelves in the Lord.</hi> v. 4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf alſo in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They <hi>muſt wait patiently for God,</hi> v. 7. You have it again repeated. <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>Wait patiently for him. Wait on the Lord and keep his way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe 6 or 7 particulars I ſhall open to you, and preſs upon you your duty under ſuch diſpenſations as theſe. I will put the three firſt together, becauſe they have a great affinity, and cogna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one with another.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is your duty under ſuch a diſpenſation, <hi>Not to fret, to be envious or angry.</hi> The words in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſignifie to inflame, to kindle, to burn, and in a ſecondary ſenſe to be <hi>angry,</hi> becauſe anger puts a man into an heat; the heating of the blood about the heart by the diſorder and diſturbance of the gall, is aſſigned as the natural cauſe of it. The moral Philoſopher, calleth Anger the irrational perturbation of the mind: others tell us it is a deſire of Revenge, and uſe to diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>ira</hi> and <hi>iracundia,</hi> making the firſt to be where we have a juſt cauſe, the
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:192227:336"/>other where there is no cauſe; but in ſhort, as to our purpoſe, anger is to be conſidered,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As <hi>a paſſion,</hi> a natural paſſion; and ſo is not in it ſelf ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it is a power created in us by God, which we may uſe well or ill.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As a <hi>Vertue</hi> when it is uſed in a good and juſtifiable cauſe when a man is troubled and deſireth the puniſhment of another <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ordinem rationis,</hi> where according to Gods will he ought to be puniſhed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As a <hi>Vice,</hi> ſuch the exerciſe of this paſſion proveth, <hi>when a man is angry either for no juſt cauſe,</hi> or <hi>in an irrational and undue manner.</hi> When wicked men proſper we are commanded not to be angry, not to fret wickedly and ſinfully, ſo as either to be <hi>diſpleaſed at Gods Providence,</hi> as <hi>Jonah</hi> was for the gourd, when God asking him if he <hi>did well to be angry,</hi> plainly implieth that he did ill and not well; or to deſire an <hi>unjuſt,</hi> and <hi>undue revenge upon him,</hi> either when the perſon hath not deſerved it, or in an undue order or meaſure. This <hi>Anger</hi> firſt boileth in the heart, and there diſcovereth it ſelf in evil wiſhes, and thoughts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful revenge; then breaketh out at the lips, and ſheweth it ſelf in uncomely ſpeeches, reproaches, and revilings; and laſtly ſheweth it ſelf in rendring evil for evil. The anger which is here forbidden us under this diſpenſation of God is ſuch as tendeth to the <hi>diſhonor of God,</hi> to the diſturbance of our own Spirits, wiling them, and putting them into diſorder; and to the unjuſt diſturbance of others. From this anger it is the will of God that his people under ſuch diſpenſations ſhould ceaſe. This is the <hi>wrath</hi> they ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake.</p>
                  <p>The word tranſlated <hi>[envy]</hi> ſignifieth to <hi>envy</hi> or emulate. <hi>Envy</hi> is properly an hatred of or a trouble for the felicity of another, whether the cauſe of it be a fear of ſome hurt to our ſelves, or a diſcontent that it is well with them, or that they are in a better eſtate than our ſelves. Hence is hatred, detraction, rejoicing in the evil of our neighbour, Affliction at their proſperity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is a juſt anger at the proſperity of wicked men as, God is diſhonoured by reaſon of it, and the intereſt of God in the world ſuffereth by it; for the heart of a man to be hot and zealous for God, yea and to deſire Gods juſt revenge of his own name and glory upon ſinners, is but what he may and ought to crave and do. Thus we find <hi>Moſes,</hi> the meekeſt men on the Earth often
<pb facs="tcp:192227:337"/>angry, and executing the vengeance upon God but for a man to be diſpleaſed and diſcontented at Gods Providence for it, or to be angry at their Bretherns good, this is ſinful, the firſt is againſt the <hi>love</hi> which <hi>we owe to God,</hi> the ſecond againſt <hi>the love which we owe unto our Neighbour.</hi> To deſire an undue or unjuſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, is a ſin againſt Juſtice, that Juſtice which we owe unto all men; this envying at the proſperity of ſinners, is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den alſo in other Texts. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Envy not thou the oppreſſor, chuſe none of his ways,</hi> Prov. 24.1. <hi>Be not envious as the evil doers, neither deſire thou to be with them.</hi> In ſum, God in this precept, forbiddeth his people under ſuch diſpenſations: all diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at their own low eſtate, all diſpleaſure at Gods dealings with others, all accuſations of God of injuſtice or hard dealings with his people whatſoever, as a fruit, or indication of any of thoſe paſſions, is certainly here forbidden us, under the notions of fretting, being angry, or envious. Let me now preſs this nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or prohibitive part of your duty upon you by ſome few argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I beſeech you to conſider the <hi>exceeding ſinfulneſs of it:</hi> when God ſaid to the Prophet <hi>Jonah. Doſt thou well to be angry,</hi> it is certainly implyed that he did not well. It is in this <hi>Pſalm</hi> twice forbidden us, twice in the Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> at leaſt. <hi>Envy</hi> is by the Apoſtle reckoned up as one of the <hi>fruits of the fleſh;</hi> now certainly if no more could be ſaid than this; It is the will of God, that if thou ſeeſt the wicked proſper, grow rich, and great, thou ſhouldſt not be diſpleaſed at God, nor envy them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſhould be enough to engage the people of God to take heed to their Spirits in this thing; and indeed we had need watch, for we ſhall find our Souls under very great temptations in the caſe, and that it is a very hard thing for a good man to look with a good Eye upon the proſperity of wicked men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But I ſhall ſhew you, that it is a ſin which receiveth more than ordinary aggravations. 1. As firſt, <hi>it is againſt the expreſs letter of the Divine Law,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.9, 10. It is ſaid, <hi>that the Lord was angry with Solomon, becauſe his heart was turned from the Lord God of Iſrael, who had appeared to him twice, and had commanded him concerning this thing that he ſhould not go after other Gods.</hi> God hath commanded us <hi>concerning</hi> this thing, this particular thing, and hath been pleaſed to make it the matter of a precept many times repeated. If God had commanded us ſome great thing,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:192227:337"/>ſhould we not have obeyed him in it? How much more in the forbearing of a little Iuſt, or paſſion! It is not concluded a ſin, meerly from conſequence of Scripture, or to be concluded from ſome precepts that are laid down there, it is the expreſs letter of Scripture, he that runs may read the will of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, by how much the more precepts are violated by any ſinful action, by ſo much the ſin is greater: you have heard this is a Sin againſt both Tables; a ſin againſt the duty which we owe unto God, and the duty which we owe to our Neighbour; that which we are forbidden in many Scriptures, thoſe ſo plain that he who runs may read them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, <hi>Some ſins are in their own nature more heinous than others, amongſt others the ſin of Murther is a very great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.32. <hi>Men do not deſpiſe a thief if he ſtealeth to ſatisfy his Soul when he is hungry,</hi> but, <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>whoſo committeth adultery with a woman lacketh underſtanding,</hi> he doth injury to his neighbour of an higher nature. But now <hi>Murther</hi> that is an higher tranſgreſſion; St. <hi>John</hi> tells us <hi>no Murtherer hath eternal life.</hi> Our Saviour reduceth <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> under the commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> and makes him that is angry with his Brother without a cauſe no leſs than a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Further yet, <hi>a ſin that breaketh out at the lips in ſinful words, or in the converſation by irregular actions, is greater, than that which is only in the heart defiling that;</hi> Now it is a very hard thing for men to keep the fire of anger and envy within the chimney of their corrupt hearts: Even the beſt men have not been able to keep it in.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Finally by how much any ſin is more the mother of Sin, and brings forth more ſins, by ſo much the greater it is.</hi> This fretting, and envying at the proſperity of ſinners, beſides the diſcontent, and impatience of the Spirit which conſtantly attendeth it, bringeth forth a world of ſin at our lips, and in our converſation, reviling ſpeeches, detracting words, ſpightful thoughts, words and actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, this ſin receiveth an aggravation from the <hi>perſons offending.</hi> In that Text, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.4, 9. I obſerve two aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Solomons ſin of Apoſtacy.</hi> The firſt, that he did it <hi>when he was old,</hi> ſo had he great experiences of God. <hi>v.</hi> 9. there's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſion, it was after <hi>God had appeared to him twice:</hi> for men
<pb facs="tcp:192227:338"/>that know not God, nor have had any experience of his ways, to fret and vex that others have more of the world than they have, is not ſuch a guilt as for the people of God to do it. They are called the <hi>Children of Light,</hi> and that not only in reſpect of grace, and mercy, which may be compared to light of which they are Children, but with reſpect to knowledg; they are a people who know better things than others and ſhould know the riches, the honours all the good things of the world are not worth valuing, now for you after that you have been thus far enlightened, ſtill to be ſo enamoured upon them as to <hi>fret, vex,</hi> and be <hi>envious,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others have more of them than you have; muſt be a great tranſgreſſion; Eſpecially to conſider that you are the Children of God, hears of grace, yea and of glory too. Thus I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Father of the Prodigal, rebuked his Son fretting for the fatted Calf ſlain for his Brother; Son (ſaith he,) remember thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine, for thoſe whom God hath made the heirs of grace and glory, the heirs of the Kingdom, to whom God hath ſaid <hi>All that I have is thine.</hi> I ſay for theſe to fret, vex and repine that wicked men proſper in this world, and have a little of this worlds goods, muſt be a great provocation. And to this, there are not many of Gods people but in one degree or other, have had an experience of the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and vanity of all theſe things, enough to depretiate them, and render them invaluable to any good and gracious heart.</p>
                  <p>Further yet, what doth any man get by <hi>fretting, vexing,</hi> or being <hi>envious</hi> at the <hi>proſperity of ſinners?</hi> as our Saviour ſaid of thought-fulneſs, none can by thinking add one cubit to his ſtature. So I may ſay, none by fretting, vexing, or envy, can either detract a cubit from the ſtature of a ſinner in proſperity, nor add a cubit to his own, it is a ſin, that can end in nothing but murmurings and repinings againſt God, in tormenting and macerating of our ſelves, and in the diſcompoſure of our Spirits. To ſhut up this diſcourſe <hi>by how much any ſin is more cauſeleſs,</hi> by ſo much the greater it is, there is neither ſo much good in the higheſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity a ſinner is capable of, nor ſo much evil in the loweſt and moſt afflicted eſtate of the people of God, as to give a reaſonable ground or occaſion for a Child of God, to give himſelf the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance ſo much as of one hour, or to wile his Spirit, for—<hi>tollun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in altum, ut lapſu graviore ruant,</hi> they are ſet in ſlippery places, they are mounted up to Heaven, but they ſhall be thrown down to Hell. It will be a great piece of a ſinners infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:192227:338"/>in Hell, that he hath had an external felicity upon earth. But I have ſhewed you this largely in the opening of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. This is enough to have ſpoken to the firſt thing in a Chriſtians duty under ſuch a diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I proceed to a ſecond thing, wherein the duty of a child of God lieth under ſuch a diſpenſation of Providence, as I have been diſcourſing of; <hi>That is, living a life of faith.</hi> This is called <hi>Truſting in the Lord,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>Committing our way unto the Lord,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>Reſting on the Lord,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>Truſt in the Lord,</hi> verſ. 3. and <hi>verily thou ſhalt be fed:</hi> it may be read, and is read by ſome, <hi>Feed upon truth:</hi> the words are <gap reason="foreign">

I will turn you to ſome other texts where the ſame word is uſed, Pſal. 25.2 <hi>O my God, I will truſt in thee, let me not be aſhamed.</hi> Prov. 28.26. <hi>He that truſteth in his own heart is a fool.</hi> Jer. 7.8. <hi>Behold you truſt in lying words, that will not profit.</hi> Pſal. 118. <hi>It is better to truſt in the Lord, than to put confidence in man.</hi> In ſhort, it ſignifieth to repoſe a confidence in another for the effecting of ſomething for our advantage; from which act of the mind proceedeth another, which is <hi>hoping,</hi> which is the ſouls motion in expectation of a thing. The ſecond expreſſion, as we tranſlate it, is <hi>verily thou ſhalt be fed,</hi> as others feed on truth. It is the word that is ordinarily uſed in Scripture, and tranſlated <hi>truth:</hi> the word tranſlated <hi>feed,</hi> is alſo what is ordinarily ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated; thoſe that tranſlate it <hi>verily,</hi> take it adverbially: but how <gap reason="foreign">

You have heard the words expreſſive of the Act; there are two words in theſe verſes, that expreſs the object of this Act; <hi>Truth, The Lord Jehovah.</hi> God is the <hi>objectum quod:</hi> Jer. 17.3, 4. <hi>Curſed be he that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm.</hi> God is the object which the ſoul is to truſt in. The word of truth is the next object, the object by and through which, and upon the account and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which, we truſt in God at ſuch a time. The object of faith is the <hi>truth, power</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God revealed to the child of God in the word. There are uſually mentioned two <hi>acts of faith.</hi> The firſt is called <hi>Aſſent,</hi> by which the ſoul agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the <hi>Propoſition</hi> of the word, as a <hi>true ſaying.</hi> The ſecond is an <hi>Act of recumbency,</hi> a reſting upon the promiſe, a reſting upon Gods truth, power and goodneſs, as declared and held forth in his word. This is that which prophane perſons in our age (to ſhew their Atheiſm as well as wit) call a lolling upon Chriſt and his promiſe. Rolling our ſelves and reſting upon <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> and upon the <hi>word of truth,</hi> are (as you ſee) Scripture-terms of which we need not be aſhamed. Hence if you ask me, what it is for the ſoul of a Chriſtian to live <hi>by faith</hi> in an evil time. I anſwer it lyeth in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In the ſouls fixed and ſteady aſſent unto thoſe Promiſes which God hath made to his People, ſuted to ſuch a diſpenſation.</hi> Theſe are many and more than one ſort: they are written in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and brought to our minds by reading and by hearing the word of God: the buſineſs of faith is to unite the ſoul to theſe words, and to command the ſoul into a fixed and ſteady aſſent to them, that the ſoul ſhall no more doubt of the fulfilling them, than of any thing of more ſenſible demonſtration. Theſe Promiſes
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:192227:339"/>might be brought under ſeveral heads: I intend not to inlarge this diſcourſe ſo far as to treat of all. I ſhall only inſtance in two ſorts, and ſpeak ſomething to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is thoſe promiſes which God hath made <hi>for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of wicked men, though ſet upon the higheſt pinacle of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, power and proſperity:</hi> of which you have divers in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pſalm, verſ. 2. <hi>For they ſhall ſoon be cut down like the graſs, and wither like the green herb:</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>For evil doers ſhall be cut off:</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>Yet a little while and the wicked ſhall not be: yea thou ſhalt diligently conſider his place, and it ſhall not be.</hi> So verſ. 13, 15, 17, 20, 22, 28, 38. Pſal. 1.4. <hi>They ſhall be as the chaff, which the wind bloweth to and fro.</hi> The Scripture is full of ſuch words as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort are <hi>thoſe Promiſes which God hath made for the protection and preſervation of his people, under the preſſures of ungodly men.</hi> Pſal. 125.3. <hi>The rod of the wicked ſhall not reſt upon the lot of the righteous.</hi> Pſal. 46.5. <hi>God is in the midſt of his Church, therefore it ſhall not fall.</hi> Mat. 16.18. <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> Pſal. 94.14. <hi>For the Lord will not caſt off his people, neither will he forſake his inheritance.</hi> Mica. 4.4, 11, 12. So quite through this Pſalm there are many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſame import. Now the work of faith is to perſwade the ſoul, of the certainty, and undoubted verity of theſe words of God, to ſettle the ſoul in this perſwaſion. That ſooner ſhall Heaven and earth paſs away, than any of theſe things ſhall fail which God hath ſpoken. Then the work of faith is further to carry out the ſoul without any carping, trouble or diſputing, to reſt wholly upon theſe words. A Chriſtian ſeeth the word of God what he hath ſaid for its relief: now faith teacheth the ſoul to agree this as the word of him <hi>who cannot lye or repent:</hi> and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the ſoul to truſt in God for the fulfilling of it, to roll it ſelf upon the promiſe, and to commit it ſelf, its cauſe, its way unto the Lord: the ſoul of a Chriſtian is very ſolicitous and careful for the concern and intereſt of God in the world: faith teacheth the ſoul to caſt its care, the burthen of its ſpirit upon the Lord, aſſuring it that God careth for it. Faith ſpeaketh to the ſoul in the language of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.8. <hi>If thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poor, and violent perverting of Juſtice, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a Province; marvel not at the matter, for he that is higher than the higheſt regardeth, and there be higher than they.</hi> I ſay, this is a great piece of the Child of Gods duty in ſuch a time when
<pb facs="tcp:192227:340"/>the vileſt men are exalted, and the wicked walk on every ſide, and the people of God are troden under foot, as the mire in the ſtreets. It is the Will of God concerning them, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> This is the proper time for the exerciſe of Faith, when the eye of ſenſe faileth; Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen, the ſubſtance of things hoped for: The proper operation of Faith is, where ſenſe faileth, where God is truſted, and not ſeen: <hi>Bleſſed are they,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>who have not ſeen, and yet believe.</hi> This is <hi>Opus diei in die ſuo.</hi> Though the people of God ought to be careful of all duty at all times, yet they ought to have a ſpecial regard to the duty of their day; the ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of a duty, addeth much to the weight and importance of it. <hi>The foundations are ſhaken</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt) Pſal.</hi> 11.3, 4, <hi>What ſhall, what can the righteous do?</hi> Mark what follows: <hi>The Lords Throne is in Heaven, his eyes ſee, his eye-lids try the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men.</hi> This is that life which the Saints have lived, yea, and they have lived well upon it. When <hi>David</hi> had loſt all, the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had taken <hi>Ziglag,</hi> and in it all that he had, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6, the Text ſaith, <hi>David encouraged himſelf in God,</hi> the Truth, Power, and Goodneſs of God; nor did he hope in God in vain, as you ſhall read in that ſtory. What had <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to live upon but Faith, when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> had beſieged him with his mighty Army, and ranted againſt him, and the God of Heaven too after that rate you read. What had all the Patriarchs, all the Saints and Servants of God to live upon but Faith? of whom you read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Nor is there any life which ſo glorifieth God as this; it eminently glorifieth three Attributes of his, his <hi>Power, Goodneſs and Truth.</hi> No man will truſt in a bruiſed Reed, or lean upon a broken Staff; therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. ſaith, <hi>He believed that God was able to raiſe him from the dead:</hi> and again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, <hi>He believed that he who promiſed was able to perform.</hi> It giveth God the glory of his <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> for the expectation of his ſoul, is the Mercy and Goodneſs of God; and it alſo giveth God the glory of his truth, for the proximate object of Faith, is the Word, and Promiſe of God. O therefore let this be your care, when you cannot live by ſenſe, live by Faith. It is the happineſs of a Child of God, he hath ſomething to live on in the worſt of times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10, <hi>The young Lions ſhall be hunger-bit; but there is no want to them that fear the Lord.</hi> One would think that of all creatures the Lion ſhould be moſt out of danger of being hunger bit. The Lion
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:192227:340"/>the King of the Foreſt, all other Beaſts are ſubject to this Beaſt: yet if an old Lion, that cannot run for its prey, that hath loſt much of its ſtrength may be hunger-bitten; one would think a <hi>young-Lion</hi> that is in its full ſtrength ſhould not. Yes, ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> a <hi>young Lion</hi> may be hunger-bitten: thoſe that have moſt of the world, wicked men that have greateſt honours, greateſt power, great advantages to provide for themſelves, they may be hunger bitten, they may come to want; but there ſhall be no want to them who fear the Lord, there ſhall be no time ſo ill, but they ſhall live; if they cannot live upon bread, they ſhall feed upon truth. How much better is the eſtate of a godly man, than that of his neighbour? It is a great point this, a great piece of duty: Let me therefore a little further enlarge upon it three ways; 1. Shewing you how a Chriſtian may know if he liveth this life. 2. Directing you in order to it. 3. Perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Will ſome Chriſtian ſay, how ſhall I know if I live this life? Suffer me to give you five or Six Characters of it. 1. It is a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life. Our life</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> What Chriſt ſometimes ſaid to his Diſciples when they would have had him to have eaten ſomething, that a Child of God may ſay to all the world; <hi>I have meat to eat you know not of.</hi> His life is a ſpiritual life; ſuch is the life of Faith, both with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſubject, and to the object of it. As to the <hi>ſubject</hi> of it, it is the ſoul that lives; the <hi>body lives by bread,</hi> the ſoul lives <hi>by truth,</hi> by the <hi>promiſe.</hi> There are many that in evil days, their bodies have enough to feed upon, but their ſouls have nothing; hence their hearts become like <hi>Nabals,</hi> dead as a ſtone: yea, and as to the object <hi>it is ſpiritual</hi> too, he that feedeth upon <hi>truth,</hi> feedeth upon <hi>Jehovah:</hi> It is the truth of God in the word, which the ſoul liveth upon; the ſoul of a Believer can no more live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Words and Syllables, than another ſoul. No but it is the truth of God in theſe words, his power and ability to perform what he hath ſaid, his inclination and good-will to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and his truth and faithfulneſs. Every life in an evil day, is not a life of faith; ſome may live upon fancy and fooliſh hope, ſome may live upon means, with which their eye feedeth them; another may live upon a <hi>Roman</hi> ſpirit of his own. <hi>Tu ne cede ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, ſed contra audentior ito.</hi> Theſe men may live at Sea, in the midſt of troubles, and never think of God and Chriſt, nor upon the power, goodneſs, and truth of God, but upon an,

                     </q> or ſome ſuch thing; but this is not to live upon faith, if thy ſoul liveth the life of faith, thy heart is alive in an evil time; and the life and courage of it is maintained from God, thy heart is maintained from the Truth, Power, and Goodneſs of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This life of Faith is a <hi>quiet life:</hi> It is a quiet life <hi>as to paſſions.</hi> Faith hath a wonderful power, to keep the mind in a calm ſerene temper: It is the unbelieving ſoul that fretteth, and ſumeth, and vexeth; all turbulent paſſions upon Gods providence are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of unbelief. The Prophet telleth us, <hi>He that believeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not haſte:</hi> Faith dryeth up immoderate tears, ſcatters the ſtorms of fears, maketh the ſoul to ceaſe from anger, and forſake wrath: It quieteth the tongue, ſo as it doth not charge God fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly; it keeps a man from all murmuring and flyings out againſt God, from all indecent and extravagant flying out againſt men, who are Gods inſtruments; <hi>I held my peace, becauſe I knew it was thy doing. David</hi> believed that God had done what was done, he duſt not mutter or repine, becauſe the Lord had done it. And ſo as to action, I mean irregular actions, Take an unbeliever, and let him be in any ſtreight or diſtreſs, he is unquiet, and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and makes no conſcience what means he uſeth to ſet himſelf at liberty, but <hi>he that believeth maketh not haſte,</hi> he who by faith eveth the promiſe, gives credit to it, and hath committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Power, Goodneſs, and Truth of God for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it: as he is not <hi>haſty</hi> with his ſpirit, to murmur, fret, and vex, becauſe it is not preſently made good to him; ſo he is not haſty with his tongue to charge God fooliſhly, nor in his action: He dareth not uſe any ſiniſter or unlawful means, to quit himſelf of any difficulty in which he is entangled; he believeth that God will preſerve, uphold, deliver him, and in his own time find out ſome lawful way and means, and the belief of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth him from impatience, or any thing which ſhould be a fruit, and indication of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, <hi>The life of Faith,</hi> is an <hi>expectant life.</hi> The Apoſtle telleth us, that <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen:</hi> Hence Faith hath always two daughters which are its genuine off ſpring. 1. <hi>Hope,</hi> which is the ſouls <hi>looking up,</hi> or <hi>looking out</hi> for thoſe things of which Faith giveth an evidence or aſſurance. <hi>Faith</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth, hope expecteth, and this is ſo inſeparable from <hi>Faith,</hi> that it is often in Scripture put for Faith, and only differeth in
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:192227:341"/>this, that Hope is an <hi>expectancy</hi> upon faith's evidence; and the certainty which it giveth the ſoul of the thing promiſed in the word. Every hope indeed doth not ſpeak faith, but every ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope doth; there is an hope of an hypocrite which groweth up <hi>like the ruſh without mire, and the flag without water. Patience</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother daughter of Faith (I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak to that more fully hereafter). <hi>Faith</hi> aſſureth the thing to the ſoul, <hi>Hope</hi> looketh out for it, and expects it; <hi>Patience</hi> keeps the ſoul ſtill, and waiting for it: If you ask me what the ſoul expecteth, what it waiteth for; it muſt needs be that, of which Faith hath given the ſoul an evidence, that is the Promiſe. The Promiſes are of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious natures, for outward mercies, ſuch as <hi>Protection, Deliverance,</hi> &amp;c. Spiritual mercies, ſuch as inward <hi>Support, Strength, Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Eternal happineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Again, <hi>The life of Faith is an active life:</hi> The operation of Faith doth not terminate in a meer ſpeculation. The activity of Faith lieth,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In the diligent uſe of all natural and rational means which God hath appointed, in order to the obtaining of the mercy, of which faith hath given the ſoul an evidence and aſſurance.</hi> As Faith doth quiet the ſoul, and reſtrain it from the uſe of all unlawful means; ſo it doth quicken and engage the ſoul in the uſe of all lawful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means. The reaſon of which is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> becauſe Faith can aſſure the ſoul of no mercy, but in that manner and order, and under thoſe circumſtances, in, and under which, God hath promiſed to beſtow it. Now God hath promiſed mercies in the uſe of means; ſo it quickeneth and engageth the ſoul to the uſe of means, as a piece of the Will of God, in order to the obtaining of our deſired mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It lyeth in the uſe of all <hi>ſpiritual means;</hi> and here <hi>Prayer</hi> in a ſpecial manner, <hi>Prayer</hi> being the general ſpiritual means to be uſed for the obtaining of any mercy. <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 9, <hi>underſtood by Books,</hi> that the time was come, for the fulfilling of the 70 years captivity; and this faith of his, as to what he read in the Books, quickned him up, to pour out that fervent prayer unto God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The life of Faith is <hi>a cheerful</hi> and <hi>joyous life:</hi> you read in Scripture of a joy and peace which attendeth believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. <hi>Believing the glory of God,</hi> is a great means to make the ſoul to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the hopes of it: Now the reaſon of this joy, is the ſtrength of that evidence which faith doth give the ſoul; for joy is nothing elſe but the complacency of the ſoul, or rather the expreſſion of this complacency, upon the ſouls union to its deſired object. Now according to the <hi>nearneſs</hi> and <hi>fulneſs</hi> of this union, ſo is the joy.
<pb facs="tcp:192227:342" rendition="simple:additions"/>Faith giving the ſoul a great and unqueſtionable evidence of the thing, doth alſo give unto the ſoul a proportionable joy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The life of Faith is <hi>a crucifying, dying life to the world. This is the victory</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>by which we overcome the world, even our faith.</hi> Faith looketh up to the <hi>Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> and by it, the heart of a Chriſtian is crucified to the world, and the world is crucified to his heart. The proper operation of Faith is to work againſt hope; for indeed, if once the mercy cometh in ſight, ſo as ſenſe cometh in play, <hi>faith ceaſeth</hi> as well as <hi>hope:</hi> Hence the operation, and exerciſe of Faith, muſt needs crucifie the heart of a Chriſtian, to the world, to ſenſe, and to all <hi>ſenſible objects.</hi> Faith made <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> overlook <hi>his own body, which was now dead,</hi> and <hi>Sarahs dead womb;</hi> it made him to overlook the <hi>Knife</hi> and the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the loſs of <hi>Iſaac's</hi> natural life, and only to conſider, that <hi>God was able to raiſe him up from the dead;</hi> it maketh a Chriſtian overlook all ſeeming difficulties, in regard of ſenſe, and all contrarieties whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever indeed ſeemeth to be in his way: Now by theſe things, you may try your ſelves whether you live the life of Faith, under ſad and dark Providences, yea, or no. By this time methinks I hear ſome of you ſaying to me, But how ſhould we come to live this life? what ſhould we do, that in dark and troubleſom times we might live this life of Faith? Let me give you ſomething of advice in the caſe, and then conclude with two or three Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Study the Scriptures,</hi> and obſerve the promiſes repoſited in that ſtorehouſe for the people of God at all times, and for all ſorts of mercies. The promiſes are thoſe words by which men live, The Scripture is a rich Store-houſe of mercy, it is full of promiſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for this life, and that which is to come; there is in them a <hi>ſalve</hi> for every ſore, and this is well worth a Chriſtians obſervation, to ſee how God in his word hath fitted him with a plaiſter for every wound; when thou findeſt the promiſes reſpecting thy ſtate in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, indeavour to whet them upon thy heart. It is a metaphor which God uſeth as to his precepts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. and as it is the duty of a Child of God to <hi>whet</hi> the Precepts upon his heart, to engage, and quicken him to obedience: ſo it is his duty to whet the promiſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſoul for his conſolation. The Scripture is full of comfortable words; O be not ignorant of them! it is a large and full ſtore-houſe, O be acquainted with it!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Learn to live upon God in proſperity and fulneſs.</hi> The Soul that maketh the Lord its portion in a time of proſperity and fulneſs, will ſcarce be to ſeek in a day of emptineſs and adverſity. Our too much living upon the creature, while we have it: will hinder our
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:192227:342"/>wholly living upon God when we want it. Take heed of living too much upon your creature-enjoyments when you have them, learn in the greateſt affluence of the creatures, in the greateſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of your cup, to live upon God, and to ſay of them, <hi>This is not my portion.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had his heart crucified to the world, and dyed daily. O how hard doth the Soul find it to live upon God in an evil time; that hath not learned to live upon God in a good day? and while it goeth well with him as to outward enjoyments. You that are at eaſe in the world, and do not know the evil that others meet with; learn this leſſon before the evil day cometh upon you, and ſurpriſeth you. Learn to live upon God, before you have nothing elſe but a God to encourage your ſelf in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſerve the practice and experience of the Saints of God. David</hi> lived by faith, when he had nothing in the world left him, he encouraged himſelf in his God; <hi>Job</hi> lived <hi>by faith</hi> when he ſaid. <hi>Though he kills me, yet I will put my truſt in him.</hi> Say to your Soul, <hi>my Soul, why ſhould not I go, and do likewiſe.</hi> Why ſhould I not do as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> did, I have the ſame promiſe, the ſame power, truth, and goodneſs of God to truſt to, and to live upon which any of the Servants of God have formerly had.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Call thy heart off its diſquietments,</hi> indeavour to convince thy ſelf of the ſinfulneſs of them: there is much in this as to one that is a true Chriſtian; if one that is a Child of God can effectually perſwade himſelf that it is his ſin to have his heart dead in an evil day, to have his heart dejected becauſe the Providence of God bloweth a croſs upon him, it will go a great way with him to command his heart off its diſturbance. Thus doth <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 42.11. <hi>why art thou caſt down, O my Soul, why art thou diſquieted within me truſt ſtill in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him who is the health of my countenance and my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, ſtrengthen your hearts with a reſolution <hi>to truſt in God; though he killeth me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, I will put my truſt in him.</hi> See what <hi>David</hi> doth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. He had been bitterly complaining of the proſperity of the wicked, and his own afflicted ſtate; in the cloſe of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> he cometh to give both himſelf and others good counſel. <hi>v</hi> 22.23. <hi>Caſt thy burthen upon the Lord, he ſhall ſuſtain thee, he ſhall never ſuffer the righteous to be moved. But thou, O God ſhalt bring them down into the Pit of deſtruction; bloody, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, ſhall not live out half their days, but I will truſt in thee.</hi> I have done with this diſcourſe when I have commended this life of faith to you by two or three arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>life in death,</hi> light in darkneſs, ſtrength in weakneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:192227:343"/>comfort in miſery: the Soul that can live this life is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour over <hi>tribulation,</hi> anguiſh, perſecution, famine, nakedneſs, peril Sword; yea it is more than a Conquerour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35. You ſhall ſee how it is with a Chriſtian which hath learned to live the life of faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. he may be <hi>troubled on every ſide, but he will not be diſtreſſed,</hi> he may <hi>be perplexed, but he will not be in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,</hi> he may be <hi>perſecuted</hi> but he will <hi>not be forſaken, caſt down, but he will not be deſtroyed;</hi> is not this a rare life? A perſecutor may take away the life of nature from a Chriſtian, but he cannot deprive him of his life of faith; faith will keep the head of a Chriſtian above water in the greateſt deeps of trouble, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. Read <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and obſerve in how many difficulties, in how many deaths that noble army of Martyrs lived, by virtue of faith. Yea and they lived well and cheerfully (as you will find there) Our Saviour adviſeth his diſciples, to lay up for themſelves <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in Heaven,</hi> where no moth came to corrupt, no thieves to break through, or ſteal. Is it not an excellent thing for a Chriſtian to have a life beyond the gun ſhot of a perſecution, beyond the mercies, or cruelties of bloody wretches? The life of faith is ſuch as makes a man <hi>poſt funera vivere,</hi> nay in <hi>funere vivere,</hi> to live when he is dying. <hi>Paul</hi> was in <hi>deaths often,</hi> yet lived by fatih; he ſaith of himſelf and others of the ſervants of God, that they were <hi>killed all the day long,</hi> yet they lived ſtill, they <hi>lived by faith.</hi> The <hi>life of faith</hi> cannot be taken away by <hi>any evil hand:</hi> No nor can the comfort and ſweetneſs of it be touched or empaired by the <hi>Sons of Belial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It is a diſtinguiſhing life.</hi> The unbeliever may live the life of a beaſt, which is the life of a beaſt, he may live the life of a man, which is the life of reaſon; but notwithſtanding this, he may periſh for ever: but he that liveth the life of faith ſhall not periſh, he who liveth this life ſhall live for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, <hi>It is a free, and independent life.</hi> We account in the world, that that man liveth the beſt life, that liveth the freeſt life, in leaſt dependency upon others. Hence we do not account the life of a Beggar, or a Servant, or a Child, ſo good a life as the life of him, that lives upon none, but upon what he hath of his own. There's none in the world lives ſo free a life as he who lives by faith upon the promiſe, his life is independent upon the whole Creation, it is hidden with Chriſt in God. But this is enough to have ſpoken to this piece of a Chriſtians duty in an evil time.</p>

                  <p>HAving ſhewed the equity and wiſdom of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in governing the affairs of the world, ſo as that oftentimes, <hi>the vileſt men are exalted, and the wicked walk on every ſide, The rod of the wicked lyeth upon the lot of the righteous, and they are chaſtned every morning, and plagued every moment, whiles the eyes of the wicked ſtand out with fatneſs,</hi> and they have what their hearts can wiſh, and are often ſuffered to devour thoſe who are more righteous than themſelves: I am inquiring what the duty of a Child of God is under ſuch a diſpenſation of Divine Providence; and for this purpoſe I have choſen this text, perhaps more fully expreſſive of it, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſingle portion of Scripture. Part of it I have opened. I have ſhewed you <hi>Negatively,</hi> they ought not to <hi>fret,</hi> to be <hi>angry,</hi> or to be <hi>envious. Poſitively,</hi> I have ſhewed you it in their duty to <hi>live the life of faith.</hi> I now proceed.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="602" facs="tcp:192227:344"/>3. Thirdly, It is their duty to <hi>delight themſelves in the Lord.</hi> You have it here v. 4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf alſo in the Lord.</hi> Such a time as this is uſually a time when the Child of God, cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light himſelf in the Creature: it may be he hath a dear, a loving Wife, dutiful, and pleaſant Children, and would delight in them; but a Priſon muſt ſeparate him from them, or an Exile, or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment muſt make their Company very unpleaſant to him. It may be he hath a full, and plentiful eſtate, and could take a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in that; but he ſeeth that is by Peecemeal pul'd from him every day, and becauſe he will enjoy his conſcience, and keep peace there, he ſhall not enjoy that property which the Laws of the Nation, and his honeſt Labour, or the gifts of his Friends have inveſted him with: now at ſuch a time, and under ſuch a diſpenſation of Providence as this is, what ſhall a righteous man doe, what is his duty in ſuch a day; my Text telleth you, <hi>he ſhall delight himſelf in the Lord, Delight thy ſelf in the Lord.</hi> Delight is nothing elſe, but the Soules <hi>Complacency, Reſt,</hi> and <hi>Triumph in an object.</hi> So that to make a thing or perſon the object of Delight there muſt be an apprehended goodneſs in the object, and the Soul delighting it ſelf in it, <hi>pleaſeth it ſelf with it,</hi> and <hi>reſteth,</hi> and <hi>Triumpheth,</hi> and even <hi>leapeth for joy in</hi> the Enjoyment of it. There is in delight more than a content, pleaſure and reſt of the Soul in its object; the Soul Triumpheth, Leapeth, and even Shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for joy. God is to be conſidered in himſelf, ſo his name is <hi>Jehovah, Elſhaddai,</hi> a Fountain of Sufficiency, Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There are three things which muſt concur to make a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul to delight in any object, how good and excellent ſoever it be in it ſelf. 1 <hi>Propriety,</hi> 2 <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Application.</hi> 1 <hi>Propriety.</hi> Let a thing or Perſon be in it ſelf never ſo good, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo excellent, and let it be ſo apprehended by me, this may render it the object indeed of my love, but not of my delight. For ſaith the Soul what is all this to me? here it is impoſſible that a wicked man ſhould have any <hi>Delight in God,</hi> becauſe he hath no propriety or intereſt in him. He may poſſibly from Reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that in God there is an <hi>infinite Power, Sufficiency, Goodneſs,</hi> he can have no true notion of God but he muſt conclude this. The <hi>firſt beeing</hi> muſt neceſſarily have an infiniteneſs of Power, and conſequently of <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> and the <hi>Fountain of Good</hi> from whom all good floweth, muſt neceſſarily have all good in him; but let him be never ſo apprehenſive of this, yet ſo long as his
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:192227:344"/>Soul ſaith, what portion have I in God? God is a ſtranger, an enemy to me, he can never delight himſelf in God: <hi>will the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete delight himſelf in the Almighty?</hi> Job 27.10. <hi>If thou wilt return to the Almighty, then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> None but the Child of God can delight himſelf in God, becauſe he alone hath an intereſt and propriety in him, he alone can ſay, <hi>my Lord,</hi> or <hi>my God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſſeſſion alſo is neceſſary to delight.</hi> Suppoſe a man to have a right and title to an Eſtate; and conſequently a propriety in it yet if he be kept out of the Poſſeſſion of it he can take no delight in it. Hence it is that a Soul that hath a true right and title to Chriſt and a real intereſt in him, yet if it lieth under dark appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of this title, and intereſt, he cannot <hi>delight</hi> himſelf in the Lord, for <hi>delight</hi> requires not only propriety, but ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the apprehenſion of that propriety: Now while he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth, that his Sins have ſeparated betwixt God and him, he wanteth ſuch a poſſeſſion as is neceſſary to delight.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third thing is <hi>Application.</hi> Let a Soul have never ſo true a propriety in God, never ſo true a poſſeſſion of the promiſes of God; yet if he doth not make application to his Soul of that knowledg of God which he hath and of the promiſes in which he hath an intereſt, his Soul will have no <hi>delight</hi> in God or in the promiſes: now this application is made two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>By Meditation,</hi> often thinking of God,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.34.</note> and upon the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. My meditation of him (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) ſhall be ſweet: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaks of a great delight he had in Gods Commandements, they were <hi>his Meditation night and day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>by Faith,</hi> aſſuring the Soul, and giving it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Evidence of the truth of the Promiſes. Now, from this diſcourſe both appeareth, 1. What there is in God for a Soul to delight in, in ſuch an evil day as I have been diſcourſing of, when his People are very low, and his Enemies are very high. It is that power, and ſufficiency which is in him, by which he is able to Relieve them; and that goodneſs which is in him, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth him always ready to help, and willing to ſave ſo as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſtand betwixt us and our deſired Salvation, help and deliverance, but only his wiſdom, by which he better knoweth times, and ſeaſons, and what is good, or bad for us than we doe. The Soul knowing and apprehending theſe things, and likewiſe its own propriety, and intereſt in God, and being put
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:192227:345"/>into ſome poſſeſſion of this Propriety, in a day of evil makes its application to ſuch promiſes, and portions of his word, as he hath revealed his will in, proper to ſuch a State as the Soul is in: hence it comes to be <hi>well-pleaſed with God</hi> in his diſpenſations, it is brought to a ſweet, and pleaſing reſt, and triumpheth in its portion, in the day of greateſt Evils, and ſingeth with <hi>David.</hi> Pſal. 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven hut thee?</hi> and there is none upon the Earth that I deſire <hi>beſides thee? My fleſh, and my heart faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart and my Portion for ever,</hi> v. 26. Now this is both the duty, and priviledge of every Child of God, and indeed theſe are both great arguments to perſwade it. It is their priviledge, for though there be a <hi>Power,</hi> a <hi>Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,</hi> an infinite goodneſs in God, which is inſeparable from his Divine beeing; yet this not being enough to bring the Soul to a pleaſure, delight and complacency in an object, without a <hi>Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, Poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of it, it is manifeſt, that only thoſe Souls, who have ſuch a propriety, intereſt and <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> and are in capacity to make ſuch an Application, can delight themſelves in the Lord; and as this is their Priviledge, ſo it is alſo their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: which will appear to you if you pleaſe to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is enough in God, for the Soul of a Child of God to pleaſe it ſelf with, under all diſpenſations.</hi> Shall I ſhew you what that is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whatſoever is done in the World is done by him.</hi> It is the Lord who lifteth up one and throweth down another, there is no Evil in the City which he hath not done.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In all God doth purſue the noble, good, and wiſe ends of his own glory.</hi> Whatſoever the intentions of men are, whether <hi>Aſſyria</hi> mean ſo, or ſo, God purſueth ſtill the ſame deſign of his own glory, being his own end, in all his <hi>Efficiencies,</hi> and in all his permiſſions, and to this end he ordereth all things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he is <hi>a God infinitely wiſe,</hi> and it muſt be ſaid of all his works of Providence as well as creation, <hi>In wiſdom he hath made them all.</hi> His Judgments are indeed a great deep, but they are a deep of Divine wiſdome; and all that God doth or ſuffereth to be done in the World, he doth, he ſuffereth all to be done according to his infinite wiſdome, and counſel.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he is <hi>the ſame in power that ever he was. Once have I ſpoken, yea twice have I heard it</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto God;</hi> ſo as if he pleaſed he could when he pleaſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:192227:345"/>the ſtate, and complexion of things, and turn the wheel, that now runs upon the lot of his people, upon the neck of his Enemies, and put wicked men in the ſtead of his afflicted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>That his love is the ſame that ever it was toward his people,</hi> and is working towards, and for them under the darkeſt, and moſt gloomy diſpenſations of Divine Providence. God loveth his children in Priſons, as well as in Palaces, in a poor and low, as well as in a more high, and proſperous condition, upon dunghils as well as upon Thrones: now lay all this together and Judg if a child of God hath not ground enough to delight himſelf in the Lord under all diſpenſations of Divine Providence. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to pleaſe his Soul, and to bring it to a reſt for him to think, what is now done in the World, or in that part of the World where my Lot is caſt, <hi>my heavenly Father doth it all,</hi> and he ordereth all things for his own Glory, he is infinitely wiſe and knoweth how to fetch out his honour from all, he hath all power in his hand, and can turn his hand upon the little ones, upon the poor and afflicted of his flock whenſoever he pleaſeth; and he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me as well in this low afflicted, poor, deſpiſed eſtate as he did when the world went better with me, and I had more credit and repute in it, more of the riches, honours, power, and enjoyments of it than I now have. Is not here ground enough for a Soul under ſuch diſpenſations to delight himſelf in the Lord, eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the promiſe in the Text; <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſires of thy heart?</hi> But beſides this, how often doth God call to us for this duty? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, O you righteous.</hi> Joel. 2.23. <hi>Fear not, O land, be glad, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, for the Lord will do great things,</hi> v. 21. <hi>Be glad then you children of Sion, and rejoyce in the Lord your God.</hi> Phil. 3.1. ch. 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord. Rejoyce in the Lord, and again I ſay rejoyce.</hi> We ſhall find this hath been the conſtant refuge and practice of the people of God. <hi>David</hi> his third Pſalm was compoſed when he fled from <hi>Abſolom,</hi> his 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Pſalm when he was afflicted with the words of <hi>Cuſh</hi> the <hi>Benjamite:</hi> his 34. Pſalm, when he changed his behaviour before <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Philiſtim King: his 52. Pſalm upon occaſion of the villany of <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edomite:</hi> his 54. when the <hi>Ziphites</hi> made a diſcovery of them to <hi>Saul:</hi> his 56. Pſalm when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> took him in <hi>Gath.</hi> The former part of his life, until the Lord ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him upon the Throne of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> was indeed nothing
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:192227:346"/>elſe but a time of trouble and great afflictions, when his enemies were very high, and he was very low, he had little, or nothing in the creature to delight in now at this time, the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> tell you his relief, and practice, which was to delight himſelf in God. Thus <hi>Habbackkuk,</hi> ch. 3. v. 17. <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, neither ſhall be fruit in the Vine, the labour of the Olive ſhall faile, and the fields ſhall yield no meat, the flocks ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtall,</hi> that is, though all ſenſible relief, and comfort, ſhall fail: <hi>yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation.</hi> To preſs you to this duty, I ſhall only mind you of what I have already told you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there can be no ſuch providences befal any Child of God, but he may find enough under them ſtill to delight in God: when he can ſee nothing for a Senſual eye to delight in, he may yet find enough for his Spiritual eye to delight in. Is it not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of pleaſure to thee to think, Well let times goe how they will, I have a God to go to, though (ſaith <hi>Job) Wormes ſhall eat this body, yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God?</hi> To think that now God is but doing his own work, and though men oppreſs, yet he that is higher then the higheſt conſidereth the matter? To think that God is able to turn the ball when he pleaſeth, that in the mean time he is in the love and favour of God, he may have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, and God will provide for him? Theſe and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſuch things as theſe afford matter enough for the child of God to delight himſelf in the Lord at all times.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider again, <hi>how equitable it is, that Children ſhould</hi> at all times delight themſelves in him, becauſe he at all times delighteth himſelf in them: whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth, as a Father his Son in whom he delighteth; his chaſtening is not a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wrath, but of wiſdome. Obſerve how he ſpeaketh to his afflicted Church. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.11. <hi>O thou afflicted, toſſed with tempeſts and not comforted,</hi> behold I will lay thy ſtones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with ſaphires. Chriſt was <hi>anointed</hi> to <hi>appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for aſhes, the oyl of joy for mourning, and the garment of gladneſs, for the ſpirit of heavineſs,</hi> Iſa. 64.1, 3. Though his people <hi>have lien amongſt the Pots</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt expreſſeth it) yet he hath a pleaſure in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let me Thirdly, offer to your conſideration, <hi>the advantage of this delighting your ſelves in the Lord in a day of Evil.</hi> It would
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:192227:346"/>arme the Soul againſt all the temptations of an evil time. 1. It would <hi>abſtract the mind from the world:</hi> we ſee if the Husband de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in his Wife, or a Father on his Child, how it draweth off their hearts from all other objects, that all are nothing to them in compariſon of that object in which the great delight of their heart is. 2. <hi>It would fill the mind of a man,</hi> ſo as it ſhould ſay to all the world, as <hi>Eſay, I have enough, I have enough, keep what thou haſt unto thy ſelf;</hi> or as <hi>Jacob</hi> (whoſe delight was in <hi>Joſeph</hi>) It is enough: is <hi>Joſeph</hi> yet alive? It is enough. 3. <hi>It would give the Soul a reſt.</hi> The mind of a man reſteth in the object of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. 4. Finally, it would wonderfully quiet the mind as to the Will of God; we are uſually ſatisfied with what is done by thoſe perſons whom we principally love, and delight in. Let this therefore be our ſtudy, our great labour and buſineſs, to bring up our hearts to a delight in the Lord. Study his attributes that you may know what he is in his Power, Goodneſs, Truth, Wiſdom <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Study his promiſes, which concern this life, or that which is to come; particularly thoſe which more ſpecially ſute thy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: Conſider the examples of the Saints, and Servants of God, in thy circumſtances; meditate upon theſe things, whet them upon thy heart; ſay often to thy ſelf, This God is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Thus and thus he hath revealed himſelf, and he who hath ſaid it, is <hi>Power, Goodneſs, Truth,</hi> &amp;c. But this is enough to have ſpoken, to this other piece of a Chriſtians duty, under ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Divine Providence. I proceed to another piece of Duty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Depart from evil, and do good.</hi> You have it. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Fret not thy ſelf in any wiſe to do Evil.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord and do good;</hi> you have them both together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.12. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12. Now this <hi>doing of good,</hi> is a very large term according to the intent of all that duty, which is required of us by the precepts of the firſt and ſecond table. There is a duty which we owe unto God, all which is comprehended under the firſt and great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart and all thy Soul, and all thy Strength.</hi> Thus that man doth good, that loveth, and feareth God, that prayeth unto him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth all thoſe acts of homage, and worſhip which God hath in his word required, as much and as zealouſly and warmly in the worſt, as in the beſt of times: this is properly a doing of good, it is <hi>honeſt and juſt,</hi> and what God requireth of us; it bringeth
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:192227:347"/>profit and advantage to our ſelves; it will bring comfort, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and peace to the Soul. So that take <hi>good</hi> in what notion you will, this is a true <hi>doing good.</hi> Again, there is a <hi>good</hi> which may be done to our ſelves, or to others: the Apoſtle commandeth us to <hi>do good to all,</hi> Gal. 6.10. thus our Saviour commandeth us to <hi>do good to them that hate us,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.16. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us not to forget to <hi>do good and to diſtribute;</hi> and it is one piece of our doing good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.17. to <hi>judge the fatherleſs, and relieve the oppreſſed.</hi> Further yet, there is a <hi>good of our general cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:</hi> This is comprehenſive of the whole duty of a man conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in no further capacity, than that of a creature towards God, or that of a Chriſtian relating to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. There is a good of our <hi>particular calling,</hi> reſpecting us with reference to our Relations, as Magiſtrates or Subjects, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, or Wives, Miniſters, or flock, Parents, or children, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or Servants. Finally, there is a <hi>good</hi> of a particular ſeaſon, the works, and buſineſs of our day relating to the particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and diſpenſations of Providence, under which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God to bring us. Having thus far diſcourſed of good, and diſtinguiſhed of that, it is eaſie to underſtand what <hi>Evil is.</hi> It is either the omiſſion of ſome of theſe duties, or the commiſſion or doing ſome things which are oppoſite to them. I take the precepts of the text in the large ſence. A Chriſtian ought to do all manner of good, and to abſtain from all omiſſions of any duty, or commiſſions of any thing which is contrary to that duty, which God expecteth from him, either in his general calling, or in his particular Relation; he is at all times <hi>to eſchew evil, and to do good.</hi> The precepts of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.26. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12. concern him, and oblige him at all times; but it is their more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial duty, with reference to evil times; and indeed this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt way to make times better. <hi>Evil times</hi> are ſo called upon a double account, either with reſpect to ſin, or to <hi>puniſhment,</hi> Theſe times are evil times wherein ſin aboundeth, and the love of many groweth cold; now our ſins contribute to the aboundings of ſin, in the time wherein we live: we uſe to ſay that if every man would ſweep his own door, the ſtreets would be clean. Times are alſo called evil with reſpect to puniſhment, to ſome judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God that are abroad in the world: now for us <hi>to do good,</hi> to depart from evil and do good is the way to have the judgments of God averted from us. <hi>Waſh you</hi> (ſaith God
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:192227:347"/>(<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from you: come let us reaſon together, though your ſins be as ſcarlet, you ſhall be as ſnow; though they were as crimſon, you ſhall be as white as wooll.</hi> You have it verſ. 6. <hi>Do good, and thou ſhall dwell in the land, and</hi> (as we Tranſlate it) <hi>verily thou ſhalt be fed.</hi> Zeph. 2.3. <hi>Seek you the Lord all you meek of the earth, it may be you ſhall be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</hi> Ten righteous perſons would have ſaved <hi>Sodom.</hi> Beſides, evil times being uſually times of ſuffering as to the people of God; it is unqueſtionably their great concern to take heed, that they <hi>ſuffer not as evil doers.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.14. <hi>If you be reproached for the name of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>happy are you; for the Spirit of God and of glory reſteth upon you.</hi> On their parts he is evil <hi>ſpoken of, but on your parts he is glorified; but let none of you ſuffer as a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, or as an evil doer,</hi> &amp;c. We ordinarily call ſuffering-times evil times; now it is the great wiſdom of a Chriſtian to make the beſt of the worſt of times, that they may ſuffer with comfort, and not loſe their Crown in ſuffering; there is no ſuch way to ſecure this, as to ſuffer in, and for doing of our duty. Again, there is no ſuch way as this to <hi>convince,</hi> or <hi>condemn Adverſaries;</hi> who are the Inſtruments of evil towards you: It is our duty as much as may be, ſo to live, as to reconcile the world to the ways of God; at leaſt ſo to live, as <hi>if we</hi> cannot win and gain them, yet we may ſhame and condemn them. This you ſhall find the Apoſtle did, who lived in the firſt and moſt furious times, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Having your converſation honeſt amongſt the Gentiles, that whereas they ſpeak evil of you as evil doers, they may behold your good works, and glorifie God in the day of their viſitation.</hi> As there is an error of Opinion, and an error of Practice; ſo there is a double way of <hi>conviction.</hi> The firſt is by <hi>Argument,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> convinced the <hi>Jews,</hi> Acts 18.28. The ſecond <hi>is by a contrary Practice.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> reacheth the <hi>Judgment,</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> Joh. 8.9. They who heard Chriſt were convicted by their Conſciences. If by doing good thou doeſt not convince ſinners, and reform them, thou wilt moſt certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Noah condemned the old world.</hi> Further yet, by this means thou ſhalt have peace within: In the world (ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.) you ſhall have trouble, <hi>but in me you ſhall have peace:</hi> we are ſure enough in, and from the world to meet with trouble; it is our great concern to ſecure our peace within: now there is no other way to ſecure this, but to keep a Conſcience void of offence, both towards God and towards
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:192227:348"/>men. If a man hath a troubleſome Neighbour, if yet he hath a quiet Wife, he will do well enough, he hath peace at home: If he lives in wicked and diſturbed times, yet if he hath a quiet indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed Conſcience, this is ſomething, and he will the better graple with his other troubles: I ſay this is the way for a man to keep a quiet Conſcience, to depart from evil, and to do that which is good. Finally, thus a Chriſtian ſhall evidence his Faith in God's rewarding him; for that man who in an evil day doth evil, or neglecteth to do good, cannot be ſaid regularly to truſt in God; becauſe he uſeth not the means, in the uſe of which he may expect Gods fulfilling his Promiſe: <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle,) <hi>that there be not in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.</hi> All departing from the living God in an evil day, is a certain ſign of unbelief, or diſtruſt in God as to the iſſues of his Providence. Let me therefore beſeech you that fear God, and are brought under ſuch a diſpenſation of this, to take care as to this. Let not the evil of others be a temptation to you to omit doing good: I will yet further open it in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Be ſure you keep cloſe with God in the duties of his Worſhip.</hi> It is a ſad thing for a ſtate of affliction to drive a man from God; God chaſteneth his people to make them better: <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early,</hi> Hoſ. 5.13. 'Tis very ſad, when affliction hath a quite contrary effect upon us; when as the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>Ahaz, when he was afflicted, he did more wickedly.</hi> So God hath reaſon to ſay of any perſon: This is that perſon who when he was in affliction, left prayer, reading, hearing, left his cloſet-walking with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is a mark of an ill Servant, not dutiful Son; when he is beaten for his faults, not to ask his Fathers bleſſing, but to run out of his doors.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Be not aſhamed nor afraid to appear for the intereſt of God in evil times.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the worſt of times was not aſhamed of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Our Lord ſpeaketh dreadfully in this caſe, when he telleth us, that he who is aſhamed of him before men, of him he will be aſhamed when he cometh with his Angels. This is a particular Service every good Chriſtian oweth unto God, not to be aſhamed of the cauſe and intereſt of God in an evil time; own thy ſelf a Servant of God, when his Name is moſt blaſphemed, his truths and ways moſt diſparaged, his people moſt expoſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Perform all that duty, which thou oweſt to the worſt of men.</hi> It is a woful error for any Chriſtian to think that he can do no wrong
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:192227:348"/>to wicked and ungodly men, as if they had no civil rights; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Apoſtle ſpake chiefly with relation to Heathens, when he commanded the <hi>Romans</hi> that were Chriſtians to give unto all their dues, <hi>honour to whom honour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Do good to them that hate, and perſecute thee, bleſs them that curſe thee:</hi> It is our Saviours leſſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. I remember God gave his people a charge, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.7. <hi>To ſeek the peace of that City, whither they were carried captive, and to pray unto the Lord for it.</hi> It was an evil time, when they were in Captivity, and the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were very evil perſons; yet God commandeth his people to pray for them, and to ſeek their peace: Let them curſe, but bleſs you; let them perſecute, but do you pray. Thus <hi>David</hi> did for his <hi>Enemies,</hi> when they were ſick he <hi>humbled himſelf with faſting, and with mourning;</hi> as for his Brother, he tells you, he loſt nothing by it, <hi>his prayer returned into his own boſom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Take heed finally of uſing any unlawful means to be rid of the evil that is upon you:</hi> This is a temptation will much moleſt us in an evil time, and to which all our hearts are too too prone; this is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular evil which a child of God in ſuch a time, ſhould ſtudy, and make it his buſineſs to depart from; but I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more to this under the next head of Duty, upon which I ſhall enlarge, as it is contrary to the duty of Patience, and the fruit of a Soul making too much haſte. But I know this is an hard ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we have many temptations to the contrary, for a man to do good to others when they are doing evil to, and againſt him; this is very hard and much a croſs to the grain <hi>of fleſh and blood.</hi> Let me therefore conclude with a few Motives or Arguments to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force what I have been ſpeaking unto you. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider Firſt, <hi>That not to do this, is to be overcome with evil:</hi> It is the Apoſtolical Precept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.21, <hi>Be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi> Conſider firſt, <hi>how diſhonourable</hi> it is for one that is a Chriſtian <hi>to be overcome with evil,</hi> whether the evil of Puniſhment, or the evil of Sin; that the luſt, wickedneſs, and ſin of another, ſhould make him alſo ſin againſt God. I would fain know what it is that ſhould in an evil time make the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to be worſe than at another time: It muſt either be, the <hi>proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſtate</hi> of the wicked, or <hi>the ſadneſs of his own condition;</hi> for when the wicked are exalted, God's people uſually mourn; to be overcome either of theſe ways, is to be overcome of evil. For the luſts of another to overcome me, to make me ſin as much one

Is this, this temptation, becauſe it fareth ſo ill with thee; this is yet worſe, for then thou proclaimeſt that thou didſt only ſerve God for the loaves he gave thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Secondly, Conſider, <hi>how honourable it is for thee to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thy neighbours evil with thy good?</hi> For me to have ſo confirm'd, and healthy a Soul, that let a boiſterous ſinner do what he can, he ſhall not make me worſe; he ſhall not make me fret, fume, vex, or be impatient, or to do any thing ſhort of, or contrary to my duty; do what he can, he ſhall not turn me from my courſe of duty either towards God or Man: how honourable a thing this is for one who nameth the name of a Chriſtian, to be certain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and unmoveable in the work of the Lord; ſo as a wicked mans wretched uſage of him ſhall make him but more holy, to walk more cloſe with God, and to pray more for him, and be ready to ſhew him more kindneſs, and to do more offices of love for him. I have heard it given as the Character of an excellent Perſon, <hi>That the way to have a kindneſs from him, was to do him ſome injury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Confider again, <hi>There is nothing which more than this will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh one that is a child of God, from one that is not.</hi> It is a great piece of ſelf-denial, for a man or woman to deny himſelf in his paſſions, eſpecially thoſe of luſt and revenge. Obſerve the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt <hi>Job</hi> and his Wife: <hi>Job</hi> ſuffered much from the hand of God, yet he would not charge God fooliſhly, he did not ſpeak unadviſedly with his lips; his Wife preſently would have him to <hi>curſe God and die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again, Think with your ſelf <hi>what a baſe thing it is for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to walk beneath his Principles,</hi> or to change his Principles with his condition. There is nothing more unworthy of a Chriſtian, than to walk beneath his profeſſed Principles, or to change his Principles, and courſe of life with his condition.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly conſider, <hi>How great an Argument it will be for thee to uſe with God to bring thee out of that ſtate of affliction and miſery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which his Providence hath caſt thee,</hi> when thou canſt plead: That God's ſevere Providences to thee, have been to thee no temptation to depart from him, or from any part of thy duty; you ſhall find the Church pleading this as an Argument with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.9.
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:192227:350"/>
                     <hi>Thou haſt caſt off, and put us to ſhame, and goeſt not forth with our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> Verſ. 10. <hi>Thou makeſt us to turn back from the Enemies, and thoſe that hate us, ſpoil for themſelves.</hi> Verſ. 11. <hi>Thou haſt given us like ſheep appointed for meat, and haſt ſcattered us amongſt the heathen.</hi> Verſ. 12. <hi>Thou ſelleſt thy people for nought, and doeſt not increaſe thy wrath by their price,</hi> &amp;c. Verſ. 17. <hi>All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt faſly in thy covenant. Our heart is not turned back: neither have our ſteps declined from thy way. Though thou haſt ſore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the ſhadow of death. If we have forgotten the name of our God, or ſtretched out our hands to a ſtrange god: Shall not God ſearch this out? for he knoweth the ſecrets of the heart. Yea, for thy ſake are we killed all the day long: we are counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, why ſleepeſt thou, O Lord? ariſe, caſt us not off for ever.</hi> Thus I have opened to you a fourth branch of a Chriſtians duty, under ſuch a diſpenſation of Providence, as I have been diſcourſing of; I ſhall add but one thing more.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly then, It is the duty of a Chriſtian to <hi>reſt in the Lord, and to wait patiently for him;</hi> or in ſhort, <hi>under ſuch diſpenſations, quietly, and ſilently to wait upon, and for God.</hi> The performance of this duty, will, I conceive lie much in Four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A quiet ſubmiſſion to Gods preſent diſpenſation;</hi> a ſubmiſſion, and a quiet ſubmiſſion; this is implied in the command of <hi>keeping ſilence to God.</hi> There is a manifold <hi>ſilence.</hi> There is a natural <hi>ſilence</hi> which is oppoſed to <hi>ſpeaking;</hi> thus he is ſilent, that hath nothing to ſay, or ſaith nothing: Thus, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.10. The Elders of <hi>Zion, ſat upon the ground, and kept ſilence.</hi> There is a <hi>prudent, and politick ſilence,</hi> which is good or evil, as it is circumſtanced, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.13. <hi>The prudent man ſhall keep ſilence in that time, for it is an evil time.</hi> There is a <hi>ſinful ſilence,</hi> which is <hi>a with-holding prayer from God,</hi> or forbearing to <hi>ſtand up</hi> and <hi>ſpeak for God,</hi> Iſa. 62.6. You that <hi>make mention of the name of the Lord, keep not ſilence.</hi> Laſtly, There is an <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>Religious ſilence,</hi> Iſa. 41.1. <hi>Keep ſilence before me, O you Iſlands.</hi> Hab. 2.20. <hi>The Lord is in his holy Temple, let all the earth keep ſilence before him.</hi> Zech. 2.13. <hi>Be ſilent, O all fleſh, before the Lord, for he is raiſed up out of his holy habitation.</hi> Now this is that ſilence which the people of God ought to keep before the Lord in an evil time: But to open it yet a little more fully. The <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi> diſtinguiſheth, betwixt an <hi>internal and external ſpeech;</hi> there is the Language of the heart, as well as of the lips; for the words
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:192227:351"/>that we utter with our lips, are firſt formed and conceived in our hearts; our hearts ſpeak firſt. It is not a natural ſilence upon either account that is our duty, but an holy and Religious ſilence; not a ſilence from thoughts, but from <hi>paſſion:</hi> not a ſilence from ſpeaking, but a ſilence from ſpeaking unadviſedly. Such a ſilence as <hi>Job</hi> kept, of whom it is ſaid, That he did not charge God foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly, nor <hi>ſpeak unadviſedly</hi> with his lips. 1. A <hi>ſilence from paſſion,</hi> mourning within our ſelves, fretting, vexing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a man break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this ſilence, when he is overborn with <hi>fear,</hi> or <hi>grief,</hi> or <hi>anger.</hi> Theſe three ways the Soul is diſturb'd, and maketh a noiſe under the diſpenſations of God, which breaketh this Religious ſilence. 1. By <hi>Anger,</hi> fretting, fuming, and vexing himſelf at Gods diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations: This was <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> failing at the <hi>waters of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribah;</hi> and <hi>Jonas</hi> his error when the Gourd failed him as to its ſhelter. But of this I have ſpoken fully already when I handled the Negative part of a Chriſtians duty under Gods diſpenſations of nature. 2. <hi>Fear,</hi> Immoderate fear, is another paſſion that ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this ſilence of the Soul; fear maketh an Earthquake within us, and cauſeth great unquietneſs in our Spirits: The Soul that is overborn with fears never keepeth ſilence. 3. A third paſſion is <hi>immoderate grief;</hi> this alſo breaketh the Souls <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>quiet,</hi> Pſal. 42. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> So as that Soul, that under Gods diſpenſations of this nature, either fumeth, vexeth, or fretteth at God becauſe of them, or is overwhelmed with immoderate, or unreaſonable fears, or is overwhelmed, or drowned in immoderate grief; that Soul doth not keep ſilence: but that Soul only <hi>keepeth</hi> a due <hi>ſilence to God,</hi> which under ſuch Providences abideth in a <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>quiet temper;</hi> neither ſhaken with fear, nor overcome with immoderate grief, or ſorrow. This is now <hi>ſilentium animae,</hi> the ſilence of the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and unto God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But there is alſo a <hi>ſilence of the Tongue:</hi> this is a piece of this Religious ſilence; this is oppoſed to <hi>murmuring, curſing, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of God;</hi> to ſpeaking hardly of God, as if he were an hard Maſter, and did not deal juſtly, or equally with us; to any ſpeaking, which is derogatory to the honour and glory of God: all this now falleth under the firſt general duty, by which I open <hi>a ſilent waiting</hi> for God, which I call a free and voluntary ſubmiſſion to the good will and pleaſure of God, without any diſturbance of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or any ſinful expreſſions of our Tongues.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="615" facs="tcp:192227:351"/>2. A Second thing, wherein this duty lyeth, is, <hi>A ſteady depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God for the fulfilling of his Promiſes made to his people in ſuch a condition;</hi> he that hath nothing to depend upon, or truſt to, will not wait; ſo as there can be no patient waiting, where there is no ſecret truſt and dependance: This is indeed the proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Faith, I have ſpoken fully to it when I opened the life of Faith in ſuch a time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Third thing, in which this duty lies, is in the <hi>Souls expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and looking out for God: Early in the morning</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 5.3.) <hi>I will direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> Thus when <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his Prophecy, had put up his Prayer to God, he ſaith, Chap. 2. that he would <hi>go up to his watch-Tower:</hi> A man goeth up to a Tower, or to ſome high place to ſee whether a friend or an enemy be coming, yea or no: It is a piece of our duty in our waiting upon God under his dark diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of Providence, while we are waiting, to be alſo <hi>looking up,</hi> and <hi>living in the expectation of the fulfilling of thoſe promiſes, which we have diſcerned, and fixed our ſouls by Faith upon;</hi> and which we have been praying for. Our hearts ſhould not be dead, we muſt take heed of ſaying, <hi>I look for no good,</hi> the heart is dead when it comes to that: The Soul that waits upon God under dark Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences muſt be looking for good, and confident in its expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it from God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, This waiting muſt be <hi>in the uſe of ſuch means as God hath appointed us for the obtaining of the mercy deſign'd, and promiſed;</hi> and therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. v. 34. they are put together, <hi>wait upon the Lord, and keep his way.</hi> Now you have this duty of ſilent waiting upon God opened to you, The Sum of it is this: It is the duty of a child of God under theſe Providences, to keep his Soul from being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much ſhaken, and overcome with fears or drowned in grief; from fretting, fuming, and vexing at Gods dealings; to keep his tongue from all murmuring, all fooliſh and unadviſed ſpeaking with his lips; to keep his Soul in a quiet dependance upon God for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his word, daily looking up for him after the uſe of ſuch means, as he by the Law of Nature or in his revealed will hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the obtaining of the mercy or good thing, which is the matter of our deſires, and he hath made the Subject of his Promiſe, and conſequently the Object of our Faith. You have heard your duty, Now give me leave to plead with all you that hear me this day for the Practice of it. I have in this Diſcourſe been exhorting
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:192227:352"/>to ſeveral duties of a child of God under dark diſpenſations of Providence, when wicked men have been ſet up high, increaſed in riches, honour, every way proſpered, and the people of God are kept in low, deſpiſed, afflicted ſtates and conditions. I remember the Apoſtle calls to us, <hi>to add</hi> to our <hi>faith, knowledg,</hi> to <hi>both vertue,</hi> to <hi>vertue temperance,</hi> &amp;c. Do you alſo add to your not fretting, not being angry, and envious, a ſteady exerciſe of Faith, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God; to your dependance on God, and truſting in him, an univerſal departing from evil, and doing that which is good; and to that a patient quiet waiting for God. I ſhall in order to your better performance of this, offer ſome counſel, and then preſs it with ſome arguments, and ſo ſhut up this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, There are three things which in order to your fulfilling this point of duty, I ſhall commend to you to get a through acquaintance with. 1. <hi>Be acquainted with Gods name.</hi> It is <hi>David</hi>'s expreſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.9. <hi>I will wait upon thy name, for it is good before thy Saints.</hi> It is <hi>the Name of God</hi> which we wait upon: now it is reaſonable in order to our waiting upon his name, that we ſhould know his name; for as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>They that know thy name will put their truſt in thee,</hi> and truly they that do not know the Lords name, will never wait upon him: Well, you will ſay, <hi>What is his name?</hi> I anſwer, whatſoever he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and made himſelf known by, or to be, <hi>that is his name.</hi> I might inſtance in many particulars. His name is <hi>God allſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> Gen. 17.1. <hi>I am the Almighty God.</hi> His name is <hi>I am,</hi> the unchangeable God. His name is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the <hi>ſoveraign Lord God,</hi> and therefore we ought to wait upon him. His name is <hi>The Lord,</hi> the <hi>Lord Gracious, Merciful,</hi> &amp;c. they that know the Lords name, that are throughly acquainted with the nature of God, as he hath in his word made himſelf known to us; they will wait upon God, they will ſee it a reaſonable thing that they ſhould wait upon God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place, <hi>get an acquaintance with the promiſes of God.</hi> Two Sorts of promiſes you muſt be acquainted with, if you would bring your hearts into this frame of ſilent waiting for God. 1. <hi>All thoſe promiſes that are made to the Church, and people of God;</hi> for ſupport and comfort in, and under troubles, and deliverance out of them: of which the Scripture is full, ſuch as theſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.14. <hi>The Lord will not caſt off his people, nor forſake his inheritance.</hi> Read at your leiſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.10. <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.4, 11, 12. <hi>Iſa.</hi>
                     <pb n="617" facs="tcp:192227:352"/>27.5, 7, 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.6. A ſecond ſort of promiſes are thoſe that are ſpecially made to this waiting upon God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.13. <hi>Wait upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſtrengthen your heart. They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength like the Eagle; they ſhall run, and not be weary, they ſhall walk, and not faint.</hi> The promiſes in Scripture of this nature are very many. Theſe are but a <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, <hi>Labour to be acquainted with the ways, and methods of Divine Providence,</hi> which is to deal out diſpenſations of mercy to his people; not preſently, but after their waiting upon him ſome time. <hi>Habakkuk</hi> 2.3. <hi>The viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak; it ſhall not lie, though it tarry, wait for it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry.</hi> The Church in her Song ſaith, <hi>Lo this is our God, we have waited for him; to this is our God, we have waited for him; we will rejoyce and be glad in his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Beg of God a waiting frame of Spirit.</hi> As there is nothing more ſinful in it ſelf, nor more tormenting to our ſelves in an evil day, than an impatient, haſty Spirit; ſo there is nothing more conducive to our glorifying of God, nor to the quiet of our own Spirits, than a ſilent waiting Spirit: This the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven muſt give, and he giveth it to them that ask him; beg of God thoſe graces which may diſpoſe thee to this patient waiting: I might inſtance in many habits of grace neceſſary to bring the ſoul into this waiting temper: I will touch only upon 4 or 5. 1. <hi>Beg Faith</hi> of God, Faith in his Word and Promiſe. He that <hi>believeth maketh not haſte.</hi> The haſtineſs and impatience of the Soul floweth from its diſtruſt in God for the fulfilling of his Word. 2. <hi>Hope</hi> is another gracious habit which diſpoſeth the Soul to waiting, we hope for what we ſee not; for what we ſee, why do we any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wait for? 3. <hi>Humility</hi> is a third: the proud ſoul thinks much to wait, he looketh upon mercy as his due; and thinketh that God wrongeth him whiles he withholds it from him; the humble ſoul believeth that it deſerveth nothing, and is therefore willing upon the leaſt crevis of hope to wait upon God. 4. <hi>Pray for patience,</hi> a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive patience, this is neceſſary in order to the bearing of evils. Laſtly, Pray <hi>for meekneſs,</hi> a froward Spirit is always an haſty Spirit, and knows not how to wait. Now to preſs this duty upon you, I ſhall but name to you ſeveral Conſiderations, leaving them to be digeſted, and inlarged upon in your private thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="618" facs="tcp:192227:353"/>1. Conſider firſt, It <hi>is the work of thy day.</hi> The queſtion is, what God would have a child of his do? when the enemies of Religion and godlineſs are very high and rampant, and the people of God are low, poor, and afflicted; and God ſuffereth wicked men to devour thoſe who are more righteous than themſelves, as if men were under the ſame providence as the Fiſh of the Sea, and the Beaſts of the Earth, where, without any regard to right or wrong; the greater devoureth the leſs: at ſuch a time as this, what ſhould a good and righteous man do? Let <hi>Solomon</hi> anſwer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.22. <hi>Say not, I will recompence evil, but wait on the Lord and he ſhall ſave you.</hi> Hence you ſhall every-where in Scripture find the Church, and people of God reſolving upon it; and the Lord when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs his people what to do in an evil day: this is that which he directeth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.9. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Hab.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It is that which God hath alone left for you to do in ſuch a day.</hi> Our Eyes of ſenſe in ſuch a time are quite put out; we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do at ſuch a time, but to ſtand ſtill and ſee the Salvation of God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Are there any amongſt the Gentiles that can give rain? therefore we will wait upon thee:</hi> we have nothing elſe to do, we have none elſe we can wait upon; <hi>therefore we will wait upon thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It is that which hath been the practice of all the people of God, and what they have called their ſouls to in evil times,</hi> Pſal. 52.9. Pſal. 62.5. Indeed it is the whole buſineſs and life of a child of God: It was the practice of the Church, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.7. And of <hi>Job.</hi> The Saint hath the promiſe of heaven, but he muſt <hi>wait</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Thou haſt ground enough to do it,</hi> the Power of God, the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth of God are certainly a ſufficient ground of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to any ſoul to wait upon God, who hath promiſed help; and is ſo <hi>true,</hi> that he cannot <hi>lie;</hi> who is <hi>able to help</hi> and to do more abundantly than we ſtand in need of, and who is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in Goodneſs, and wanteth no love to prompt him to come in to the relief and ſuccour of his people.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Waiting upon God gives God the honour of many Attributes:</hi> It giveth Him the glory of his Soveraignty, His Wiſdom, His Power, His Truth, and His Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>It is a great evidence of your Faith:</hi> He that <hi>believeth maketh not haſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>It is that which in a day of evil, will diſtinguiſh you from wicked and ungodly men:</hi> they cannot wait upon God, but break out into fits of impatience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <pb n="619" facs="tcp:192227:353"/>8. <hi>There is nothing ſo effectual in an evil day, to help thee to keep down thy corruptions, to ſilence thy temptations:</hi> You have heard it in that to which many promiſes are made, That your waiting upon God is pleadable as an argument for the mercy which you deſire: In ſhort, there are very many Arguments might be uſed to perſwade this ſilent waiting upon God, but I have before ſpake to many of them, and ſhall therefore add no more to this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

                  <p>I Am (as you know) attempting to expound the hard Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Divine providence, giving you ſome account of thoſe Motions of it, which to us appear moſt difficult; I have brought theſe under ſome heads propounding to ſpeak,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, To ſuch as concern the diſpenſation, both of the more external, and the more <hi>internal and effectual means of grace.</hi> I have ſpoken to divers Queſtions, that have fallen under the Three firſt of theſe heads; ſuch as fall under the laſt, remain yet to be
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:192227:354"/>ſpoken to: but before I come to ſpeak directly to ſuch Queſtions, I ſhall lay down Two preliminary Propoſitions, to which I ſhall ſpeak ſomething.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Prop. <hi>That God in his Providential diſpenſations of grace, and the means of application of it; whether more external, or more internal; acteth freely and unaccountably, yet is in it both holy and juſt and good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>That God in the diſpenſations of his paenal Providence, in the withholding, or withdrawing of the means of grace; whether more external, or more internal; never acteth upon meer Prerogative, but upon the demerit of the ſins of people;</hi> and in this he <hi>acteth juſtly, and holily.</hi> I will begin with the firſt of theſe, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have made choice of this Text; which is a Quotation which our Apoſtle bringeth out of the Books of <hi>Moſes:</hi> you ſhall find it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto God, verſ. 18. <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy glory:</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>I will make all my goodneſs to paſs before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy.</hi> This is the Text which the Apoſtle quoteth here: The Argument which the Apoſtle is upon in this Chapter, is the rejection of the <hi>Jews;</hi> as to which he vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth God in Two things. 1. <hi>As to the promiſe made to Abraham,</hi> a thing which the <hi>Jews</hi> bare up themſelves much upon; <hi>that they were the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> and ſo in Covenant with God; and if God ſhould caſt them off, what could be ſaid to juſtifie the truth and faithfulneſs of God? What ſhould become of the promiſe, the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed for ever? The word of God would have no effect. This the Apoſtle anſwereth, verſ. 6. and ſo to verſ. 13. He telleth them in the firſt place: <hi>They were not all Iſrael which were of Iſrael.</hi> And verſ. 7. That <hi>all who were the ſeed of Abraham, were not all children:</hi> and this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, verſ. 7. Becauſe God ſaid, <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called;</hi> and that the promiſe was given to <hi>Sarah, that is,</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>they which are the children of the fleſh, theſe are not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; but the children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed.</hi> And he tells them, that it was the ſame caſe as to <hi>Rebecca. Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were both the children of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> but yet <hi>God loved Jacob,</hi> and <hi>hated Eſau,</hi> verſ. 13. But ſome may poſſibly think, this did not anſwer the Objection of the <hi>Jews:</hi> for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that the promiſe was made to the children of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſuch. <hi>Abraham</hi> indeed had a child by <hi>Hagar,</hi> that
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:192227:354"/>was <hi>Eſau,</hi> and he had Sons by <hi>Keturah;</hi> but all the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> were deſcended from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Sarah,</hi> to whom the promiſe confeſſedly was made. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The Apoſtle had yet gained <hi>One main point,</hi> viz. That the <hi>Jews</hi> could lay claim to nothing upon this account, that they were the <hi>ſeed of Abraham;</hi> for the promiſe was not made to the whole ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to a <hi>peculiar ſeed:</hi> Now this <hi>peculiar ſeed</hi> was not all the <hi>children of Iſaac;</hi> this he proveth by the inſtance of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> who were both the children of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> for ſaith he, verſ. 11. <hi>The children being not yet born, neither having done good or evil; that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth;</hi> It <hi>was ſaid unto her, The elder ſhall ſerve the younger, as it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated.</hi> This now proveth, that God was not by his promiſe tied to all the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but was yet at liberty, to what part of his ſeed he would fulfil his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Well, but might ſome ſay, being they were both the children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> how could God in righteouſneſs ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and compaſſion to one of them, and not to another? verſ. 14. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? Is there unrighteouſneſs with God?</hi> This the Apoſtle denieth, and that with his ordinary averſation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, <hi>God forbid.</hi> Now he proveth that there is no unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in this diſpenſation of God: Becauſe God had ſaid to <hi>Moſes, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion.</hi> So then, (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,) <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> If there could be unrighteouſneſs with God, it muſt be becauſe God hath ſomewhere by promiſe obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſhew mercy to all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation: but, ſaith he, the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed, will not reach ſo far: that was not made to the whole ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> no, not to all that deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> through the loins of his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as appears by Gods hating <hi>Eſau,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and his eldeſt Son too: But more than this, ſaith the Apoſtle, God when he declared his glory to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 33. ſufficiently expounded himſelf: That his promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, did not determine his grace to any parts, or Nation; but that he had a liberty left to him to ſhew, or not to ſhew mercy to whom he pleaſed; for he ſaith to <hi>Moſes, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</hi> So that the Propoſition from this Text is of eaſie deduction.</p>
                  <pb n="622" facs="tcp:192227:355"/>
                  <p>Propoſi. <hi>That God in his Providential diſpenſations of grace, and the means of its application, acteth freely, and unaccountably; and in doing ſo, there is no unrighteouſneſs with God.</hi> In this Propoſition there are Two branches, 1. <hi>That God in the diſpenſations of his grace acteth freely and unaccountably.</hi> 2. <hi>That in his doing ſo, there is no unrighteouſneſs with him.</hi> I ſay firſt, <hi>God in theſe diſpenſations acteth freely and unaccountably:</hi> the one of theſe neceſſarily followeth upon the other; if he acteth freely, he muſt needs act <hi>unaccountably:</hi> for who can give an account of what man doth, <hi>ex mero motu,</hi> out of his own free inclination, without any motive out of himſelf; (for that is meant by freely) nothing compelling, nothing moving, or alluring him, meerly from the good pleaſure of his own will. The reaſon of his having and ſhewing mercy, is, becauſe he will thew mercy. The Scripture giveth ſo plentiful a teſtimony to this, as one would wonder that any owning the Scripture, ſhould deny it: for whereas all grace, or mercy is to be conſidered; either in the firſt willing and purpoſe, or in the actual exerciſe of it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider, the one way, or the other; we ſhall find, that both flow from the free-will, and goodneſs of God, and have no other cauſe; but becauſe <hi>God will ſhew mercy to whom he will ſhew it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us conſider it <hi>firſt in the purpoſe.</hi> Gods purpoſe of grace was nothing elſe but his <hi>Eternal willing of ſome perſons, to obtain everlaſting life and ſalvation, in, and through Chriſt; and in the uſe of that means which he appointed thereunto;</hi> for the counſels of God, ordered the means, as well as the end: we do therefore ſuppoſe that God from all eternity knew <hi>who ſhould be ſaved;</hi> and that he therefore muſt needs know it, becauſe he will'd it: for whereas all mankind from eternity are to be conſidered alike, nothing but the Will of God could bring any part of them more than another, into a ſalvable eſtate; eſpecially into a certain ſtate of Salvation. God therefore decreed, or willed ſome perſons to ſo glorious an end. Now the queſtion is, what made God <hi>to will theſe,</hi> not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? what can be imagined but <hi>his will,</hi> of which we are able to give no account. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us unto the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will:</hi> hence, it is called the <hi>election of grace,</hi> Rom. 11.5. and 2 Tim. 1.8. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt,</hi> before the world began.
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:192227:355"/>
                     <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> tell us of Gods electing men <hi>out of a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight that they</hi> would <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>obey.</hi> If indeed men were to have riſen out of the Earth like <hi>Muſhromes,</hi> and to have given a being to themſelves, and to have created their own Souls, they might have quarrelled the Scripture a little upon this point; but when the bodies of all men were to be of the ſame clay, and all ſouls were Gods, which were to inform thoſe bodies, how they ſhould any of them have a diſpoſition to <hi>believe,</hi> or <hi>obey</hi> more than others; unleſs God had created it in them, or willed that in time they ſhould have it, I cannot underſtand: and if they ſay, that they had it from <hi>the will of God,</hi> the matter (as to our point) cometh much to the ſame iſſue. God purpoſed them grace from his own meer good-will and pleaſure; he <hi>willed them,</hi> in time to have a diſpoſition to believe and obey; and upon their Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to have everlaſting life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we conſider Gods <hi>acts of grace in time,</hi> they are diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, either into the more <hi>external means:</hi> Or ſecondly, <hi>thoſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits which accompany ſalvation,</hi> and make a ſoul meet for the inheritance of the Saints in Light. The means of Salvation are either the <hi>means of Purchaſe, and Redemption; ſuch was the giving</hi> of Chriſt, of which Saint <hi>John,</hi> (Joh. 3.16.) could give us no other account, but <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> For <hi>the means of application,</hi> they are either more external, or internal. The more <hi>external,</hi> is the <hi>promulgation,</hi> or <hi>publication of the Goſpel:</hi> See what our Saviour ſaith as to this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, who haſt hidden theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them to babes: Even ſo, O Father, becauſe it pleaſed thee.</hi> 2. For <hi>theſe acts of grace by which the Soul is prepared, and made fit for the inheritance of the Saints in Light:</hi> they are <hi>Effectual Calling, Juſtification,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For <hi>Effectual Calling,</hi> we are ſaid to be called <hi>with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe, and grace. Not according to our works:</hi> ſo that any thing in our ſelves is denied, but according to his purpoſe: Now what is the purpoſe of God? but the will of God determining this, or that; and it is further added, <hi>And grace;</hi> which ſpeaketh the <hi>free love</hi> and good-will of God in the caſe; for grace is nothing elſe but free love. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>The God of all grace,</hi> who hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you: ſo that God in the calling of Souls acteth as a <hi>God of

The Evangeliſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 13. telleth us, that we are <hi>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Juſtification</hi> is another <hi>act of grace, whereby God pardoneth our ſin, looketh upon us, and accepteth us as righteous, only for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt reckoned unto us for righteouſneſs.</hi> Herein alſo God acteth freely: <hi>being juſtified freely by his grace;</hi> he giveth of the <hi>fountain of life freely.</hi> To this purpoſe is that, <hi>I will heal your backsliding, and love you freely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which is that act of grace by which we are renewed in the inward-man, and made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the image of God: This is our being born of the Spirit; and our Saviour compareth the motion of the Spirit to the wind, <hi>which bloweth where it liſteth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But further yet, <hi>the diſpenſations of grace</hi> by the <hi>hand of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> muſt neceſſarily bear proportion to the <hi>purpoſe of grace.</hi> We are <hi>bleſſed in Chriſt with all ſpiritual bleſſings, according as he hath choſen us in him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, 5. Nothing cometh to paſs in the world, either as an <hi>act of grace,</hi> or a paenal diſpenſation; but it is in purſuance of ſome purpoſe of God. Now it was impoſſible that the purpoſe of God ſhould have any other foundation than his Will; for the eternal purpoſe muſt be ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to any good, or evil done by us; we are but of yeſterday. That man, or woman knoweth nothing of God, and hath very falſe conceptions, and apprehenſions of the Divine Being, that doth not conceive of him as a God from all eternity; knowing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould come to paſs in the world; nor is it poſſible for us to apprehend how God ſhould know any future thing, but becauſe he willed it; for what but the will of God ſhould bring it out of a not being, into a being; out of the order of a contingency, into a certainty; which it muſt have, or God could have no certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it. Now it was not poſſible that any thing in the creature ſhould move God from eternity to will any one grace, becauſe there was no creature pre-exiſtent to this eternal act of God; nor yet co-exiſtent with it. It is true, ſay ſome, but yet God did foreſee, that ſuch, or ſuch, would believe, repent, obey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uſing the liberty of their wills better than others; and to ſuch God
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:192227:357"/>willed eternal life. But I cannot underſtand any thing in this more than trifling. For I demand, from whence is that better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and diſpoſition of one mans will, than another? Where was the principle of this good, was it to proceed from God? then it little differeth from what we ſay, at leaſt in this caſe it doth not; for ſtill in the diſpenſations of his grace he moveth freely, and from his own meer will; only he willeth, firſt to give grace, then glory. Will they ſay, this <hi>foreſeen</hi> good diſpoſition (as is pretended) is from a mans ſelf, then there muſt be another fountain of good beſides God, all good acts proceed from ſome habits, and powers as their principles. I demand whence is that principle, that power, and habit in us, which God ſhould foreſee, and therefore will a Soul to life? Will they ſay it is from man? then ſay I, every good gift cometh not from God; man is thus made a fountain of <hi>good,</hi> indeed of all good; for he is thus made the fountain of that good, upon the foreſight of which, it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Doctrine; that God willeth all his providential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of grace and mercy; and if this be not to ſet up man in the Throne of God, and to take away from God the glory of that Attribute, in which, above all he delighteth, I underſtand nothing.</p>

Again, If <hi>acts of grace and mercy</hi> were not free and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, only fountain'd in the good-will and pleaſure of God; <hi>grace could not be grace:</hi> for what is grace, but free love? <hi>To him that worketh the reward,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is reckoned not of grace, but of debt,</hi> Rom. 4.4. If by grace, then it is no more <hi>of works, otherwiſe works would be no more works,</hi> Rom. 11.6. The very notion of grace importeth freeneſs: <hi>grace</hi> not <hi>free,</hi> is no <hi>grace;</hi> if you take away liberty, you take away grace; I mean Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal liberty. I know when God hath promiſed, he is <hi>juſt and righteous to forgive,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, But God had an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal liberty to promiſe, or not to promiſe: In ſhort, they are no better than enemies to the grace of God, who go about to found the reaſon of its acts any-where elſe than in the Divine Will: <hi>God will have mercy, becauſe he will have mercy;</hi> that's all the account which we can give, either of Gods purpoſe of grace, or of any acts of grace purſuant to that purpoſe: And ſo I paſs to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Propoſition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Memb.</hi> That ſuppoſing this, <hi>There is no unrighteouſneſs with God.</hi> This is conſiſtent with the holineſs, juſtice, and goodneſs
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:192227:358"/>of God; and conſonant to the Divine being and Nature. It is exceedingly agreeing to the Nature of the <hi>Divine being,</hi> to be the <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> of <hi>all that is upon any account good;</hi> and in this ſence it is true, eminently true, which our Lord telleth the Phariſee, <hi>There is none good but one, and that is God;</hi> other things are <hi>deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> good, he is <hi>Originally</hi> good: now I ſay it is but reaſonable, that he who is the <hi>firſt being,</hi> ſhould be owned the <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> of <hi>any good that</hi> is in the World; all diſpenſations of Grace, being ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes of goodneſs: he alſo muſt be the firſt cauſe of them; and they could be originated in nothing but the Divine Will. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is nothing more conſonant to the <hi>Divine being,</hi> than to <hi>be the Soveraign Lord, and the ſole cauſe of his own actions.</hi> God every where in holy writ, makes himſelf known to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of the Lord; it is an impeachment of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Soveraignty,</hi> to aſſert God originally not at perfect liberty, as to his own Acts, <hi>to have mercy upon whom he will have mercy;</hi> and <hi>extend compaſſion, to whom he will extend compaſſion.</hi> God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſet out under the notion of a Potter, the Creature, under the notion of Clay: God ſhewed <hi>Jeremiah</hi> this, when he carried him down to the Potters houſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. and ſhewed him the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at work; making a Veſſel of Clay, and when it was marred in his hand, making another Veſſel as it ſeemed good unto him; then telling him, Ver. 6. <hi>O houſe of Iſrael! Cannot I do with you, as this Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Behold, as the Clay is in the Potters hand, ſo are you in my hand, O you houſe of Iſrael;</hi> which alſo (alluding to that Text) confirmeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the Clay of the ſame lump, to make one Veſſel of honour, another of diſhonour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor can this poſſibly be judged <hi>unrighteouſneſs with God,</hi> for <hi>for then would God be in a lower capacity than his Creature;</hi> what man of us is there, who doth not think he hath a free, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, over his own acts of goodneſs, and mercy? To ſhew them to whom he pleaſeth, and to withhold them from whom he pleaſeth; yet is there a vaſt difference betwixt the Creature, and the Creator in this point; for all Creatures are under the Law of their Creator; they are things and perſons under authority, and are not ſoveraign Lords of their own actions; yet which of us doth judg our ſelves accountable to our Neighbour, for an act of mercy; now if there be no unrighteouſneſs with man, in this caſe, if a man doth not think himſelf bound to give any account to his Neighbour, why he is more kind to one than to another?
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:192227:358"/>Why gives he a gift to one, which he giveth not to another? How is God unrighteous in ſuch a diſcrimination? What if God willeth to ſhew mercy, and the riches of Divine Grace to one, &amp; not to another? Though God in theſe motions, be free and unaccountable, yet he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo juſt and righteous; and the reaſon is, becauſe he is neither bound, nor a debtor unto any. But this is enough, to have ſpoken to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and Confirmation of this Propoſition. For Application,</p>

                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. In the firſt place: We may learn from hence, what vain dreamers thoſe are, that go about to <hi>find out another Fountain, for acts of Divine Grace;</hi> and ſeek a cauſe <hi>in man, for the Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him.</hi> They ſay, the head of the great River <hi>Nilus,</hi> could never yet be found; It hath been ſought for, and many have travelled poſſibly ſome thouſands of miles, but yet it cannot be found. But the head of <hi>Nilus</hi> will be found, before men will find any cauſe of Divine Love out of the Divine Will. It ſpeaketh a wonderful arrogance in men, to make God accountable for his acts of Divine Grace; what greater arrogance, and vanity can be imagined than this? When a poor Creature, will not himſelf be brought to an account, why he gives one Begger mony, and not another; or why he giveth to one Child a greater Portion, than another (though they both be the acknowledged fruit of his Body) that yet this Worm ſhould dream, that God muſt be accountable to his reaſon, why he ſheweth mercy to this man, and not to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; when they are both the work of his hands. It is certainly enough to ſay, <hi>He will have mercy, on whom he will have mercy; and extend compaſſion, to whom he will extend compaſſion.</hi> What Pride, what Arrogance is this, not to allow to God whom we confeſs to be the ſupream, and moſt free agent; the liberty which we will yet claim, and challenge for our ſelves? Nor is this more unreaſonable pride, and arrogance, than it is folly and Vanity: It is ſearching for a bottom in an Abyſs; ſearching for a cauſe Antecedent to the firſt cauſe. God, they ſay, from all Eternity, foreſaw that ſuch, and ſuch would believe, would obey, would incline their hearts to his Teſtimonies; it muſt be then certain, that that they would do ſo; God could have no certain knowledg of that of which there was no certainty. Now I would fain underſtand, whence <hi>this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be,</hi> otherwiſe than from the <hi>will of God,</hi> determining their wills to theſe certain good inclinations, more than the wills of others; all others have Souls, reaſonable Souls as well as they; whence is it, that their Souls incline to that which is good, and
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:192227:359"/>the wills of others to that which is evil? Surely, to <hi>will,</hi> and to <hi>do,</hi> are both from God. Thus <hi>vain Man would be wiſe:</hi> when as he indeed is but <hi>like a wild Aſſes Colt:</hi> Proud men torture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in vain, to find out a principle of good, and of life in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; And how unreaſonable a thing is it, to charge God with unrighteouſneſs, upon this hypotheſis? Shall a man be maſter of his own favours, who is yet a debtor to the Law of God, and under an obligation to do good to all, becauſe God hath ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him; and ſhall not God, who cannot in any wiſe become a debtor to his Creature, farther than he is ſo made by his own Covenant and promiſe? Shall it be a reaſonable thing for a Man to ſay, I will be kind to ſuch a one, becauſe I will; and doth he think he is not further to be accountable to his fellow Creature? And ſhall not the Soveraign Lord of Heaven and Earth ſay, I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy, and becauſe I will have mercy; but Man ſhall for it call him before the Tribunal of his own Reaſon.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. In the ſecond place, what reaſon have we who are made partakers of this mercy of God which bringeth ſalvation, to adore, admire, and be thankful to him for it? Now this concerneth either all of us in general, or elſe ſome particular Souls. 1. Let us firſt conſider this ſo far as it reſpecteth all of us: whoſoever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth within the pale of the Church, under the preaching of the Goſpel, may ſee reaſon, 1. <hi>To adore and admire the goodneſs of God towards them.</hi> 2. <hi>To tremble and fear,</hi> leſt we be found unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable under the <hi>means of grace.</hi> The Apoſtle propoundeth the queſtion concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 3.1, 2. <hi>What advantage then hath the Jew above the Gentiles? Or what profit is there of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</hi> He anſwereth, <hi>Much every way,</hi> becauſe <hi>unto them are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Oracles of God.</hi> Whether the Goſpel in the preaching of it be a ſufficient means of Salvation, having ſuch a conſtant opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit attending it; that if men will they may believe and be ſaved: and the <hi>miniſtration</hi> of <hi>the Spirit</hi> be little differing from the miniſtration of the Goſpel, and inſeparable, or at leaſt never ſeparated from it, though affirmed by ſome, may be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubted. But that it is a great and high means of Salvation, and there is no man living under the faithful and powerful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, but if he miſſeth of Life and eternal happineſs it will be his own fault; and the proximate cauſe of damnation will be in himſelf I do not doubt. Now God hath not dealt thus with
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:192227:359"/>every Nation, O conſider how many Nations, and People there are in the World, who never heard of Chriſt; amongſt whom, the joyful ſound of the Goſpel did never come; People that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, whom the day-ſtar from on high did never yet riſe upon? Doth any ſay? But what good doth the Goſpel, or how is the preaching of the Goſpel ſuch a mercy, if God doth not give unto them that are under the ſound of it, effectual Grace; ſo as their hearts are changed upon the preaching of it, and they converted and eternally ſaved? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The Apoſtle thought it a mercy, and no ſmall mercy, that the Jews had, the <hi>Oraeles of God committed to them,</hi> to them and not to other People; yet for all this it is moſt certain, That there were many amongſt the Jews, who kept not the Laws, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and Ordinances of God; the Jews might have ſaid the ſame thing, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> crieth out, Deut. 4.8. <hi>What Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them as the Lord your God is to you in all things? That hath Statutes and Judgments ſo righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</hi> Again (as I have oft told you) though I dare not ſay with ſome, That all men ſitting under the ſound of the Goſpel, have a ſufficiency of grace given them, that if they will, they may turn unto God and live; yet I do think that there is ſuch a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Light, and means, that if men will do what in them lies, God will not be wanting to them in his effectual Grace; Men ſhall never have this to ſay: <hi>Lord, I did what was in my power to do, I would have repented, believed, but thou deniedſt me that Grace which was neceſſary to it.</hi> Now herein appeareth the greatneſs of the Grace of the Goſpel. The Heathen walk in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of Death; they have not a ſufficient Light to guide their feet into the way of Peace. But where the Goſpel is Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there a great Light ſhineth, a Light ſufficient to direct men into the way of Life. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This looketh dreadfully <hi>upon all thoſe who wilfully ſhut their eyes againſt Goſpel-light, and ſtop their Ears againſt this joyful ſound.</hi> This (ſaith our Saviour) is <hi>the condemnation, that when Light is come into the World, men love Darkneſs more than Light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> Matth. 11. Our Saviour upbraideth the Cities where his mighty works had been done, and his Goſpel preached. <hi>Capernaum</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> he ſaith, they had been <hi>lifted up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> but <hi>they ſhould be thrown down into Hell:</hi> that it <hi>ſhould be more tolerable</hi> for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, yea for Tyre and Sydon in the day
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:192227:360"/>of judgment, than for them;</hi> when the Goſpel hath been long in a place, faithfully preached, it is much to be feared, that God hath had mercy in that place, upon as many Souls of that Age, as he will have mercy. But this is but a Digreſſion, we have reaſon to <hi>adore God</hi> for his free mercy to us in giving us the Goſpel, the faithful and powerful preaching under the Goſpel, many may and do periſh, but where the Goſpel comes not, there is no hope. Now whence is it, that the rain of the Goſpel falleth upon one City, not upon another? Upon one Country, not upon another? That ſome Nations have not ſo much as the ſound of it, the feet of them which bring the glad tidings of Peace, come not amongſt them: and in the ſame Nation where the Goſpel is preached, ſome have a ſound, and little more: Preachers in ſome places, in ſtead of preaching the Goſpel, Preach human Philoſophy; or the luſts of their own hearts. In other places the Word of God is preached faithfully, and powerfully; ſo <hi>that the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force;</hi> Men are <hi>compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to come in.</hi> This difference, in the external miniſtration (which let me tell you, hath no ſmall influence upon the eternal concern, and intereſt of men; for God doth not ordinarily work by way of miracle, and heal the eyes of the blind, with <hi>Clay,</hi> and <hi>Spittle</hi>) is fountain'd only in the free-will, and Grace of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. But I truſt I ſpeak to ſome, <hi>who have taſted further of the mercy and Grace of God,</hi> than receiving the general Diſpenſation of the Goſpel with their outward ears. God hath by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, upon the preaching of the Goſpel, effectually moved their hearts, and conquered their Souls into a ſubjection to Chriſt. They have embraced the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by a <hi>Goſpel-faith;</hi> they are brought by a mighty hand out of darkneſs, into marvelous Light; and tranſlated out of this Kingdom of Sin, and Satan, into the Kingdom of the Lord Jeſus. I have this day been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to you, the Fountain of this Grace; of which God hath made you partakers: you have heard that it is the will of God only, which hath diſtinguiſhed betwixt you and others; It is not becauſe you were more nobly born than others: nor becauſe you were more rich, more honourable, or by nature better complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioned than others; God ſaw no more goodneſs in your natures, than in the natures of others, you were all the ſame fleſh; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into all Souls of the ſame nature, and ſpecies; only he
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:192227:360"/>hath willed rather to ſhew mercy unto your Souls, than to the Souls of others, becauſe he hath ſet his love upon you. There are three duties that hence lie very obvious.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Firſt is, <hi>Praiſe, Thankfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Admiration.</hi> Certainly, every ſuch Soul, ſtands highly obliged with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to cry out: <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, bleſs his Holy Name. Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</hi> If free Grace will not affect our hearts, and fill our mouths with a new Song, nothing will. It muſt certainly be an amazing conſideration, for a Soul to ſit down and think; I was in the ſame maſs, and lump of loſt man-kind, that others are; I was by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Child of wrath, as much as any; my Childhood and Youth were Vanity, as much as any others; I was grinding at the ſame Mill, it may be in actual ſins, I outſtripped many others: Now that the Lord ſhould look upon me, and pluck me as a brand out of the Fire; that God ſhould open my eyes, and change my heart: What did God ſee in me? Poſſibly, my more external circumſtances, were far leſs, and more unvaluable, than thoſe of thouſands of others; my Houſe was of ſmall account, and little eſteem; there are many more great, and noble, more wiſe, and prudent than I am; many, who in all appearance, ſo far as man can judg, might have been more ſerviceable to God than I am, or am ever like to be: now that the Lord ſhould paſs them over, and ſhew mercy to me; certainly, no Soul can ſeriouſly think of theſe things, but muſt be raviſhed with the apprehenſions of the inaccountable love of God in theſe things; and ſay, <hi>What ſhall I render unto thee, O Lard, what ſhall I render unto thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This notion of <hi>Gods Soveraignty, freedom,</hi> and <hi>inaccountble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the diſpenſations of his Grace, ſhould teach every Soul that hath been, or ſhall be made a partaker of it, the great leſſon of humility.</hi> The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. giveth this as the reaſon, why God hath ſetled the juſtification of a Sinner, upon a bottom of free Grace; and hath excluded works, that he might alſo exclude boaſting; and teach thoſe who glory, to glory in the Lord; upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, the Apoſtle exhorteth the Gentiles, not <hi>to boaſt againſt the Jews,</hi> Rom. 11.22. <hi>Behold the goodneſs, and the ſeverity of God</hi> (ſaith he) to thoſe who abide in their unbelief, ſeverity; to thee, <hi>goodneſs.</hi> Pride is a ſinful habit, diſpoſing the Soul to <hi>ſwell</hi> in the opinion of ſome excellency in it ſelf; and a little thing will ſwell our corrupt hearts. The Apoſtle propoundeth this very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:192227:361"/>as a cure for that tumour in the Souls of Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>For who maketh thee to differ from another? And what haſt thou which thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory, as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> It is nothing but the will of God, that hath made a difference betwixt thee, and the vileſt Sinner breathing; betwixt thee and the moſt filthy Drunkard, the moſt furious Perſecutor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was not for any worth, any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or holineſs which the Lord ſaw in thee; but of his meer free will, and Grace; God hath ſhewed mercy to thy Soul, what haſt thou now of thy own to boaſt, or glory in? Thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reaſon to glory, and to make thy boaſt in the Lord; and to bleſs God for what he hath done for thy Soul, more than for a thouſand others; but there is no thanks to thee, his will, his own will, was the fountain of his Grace extended to thee. God hath had mercy upon thy Soul, only becauſe he would have mercy. O therefore be not high-minded, but fear, and walk humbly before God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, this calleth upon all of you who have taſted of this free and unaccountable Grace, to live a <hi>diſtinguiſhing life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi> There is a Generation that fancyeth that the Doctrine of <hi>Free-Grace,</hi> opens a door to Liberty. It is but the old Cavil, in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time, there were thoſe that thus accuſed the Doctrine of <hi>Free-Grace,</hi> as if it gave men a liberty to go on in ſin; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Apoſtles anticipation of that Cavil, Rom. 6.1. <hi>What,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall we then continue in ſin, that Grace may abound? God forbid:</hi> and ſo he goeth on, ſhewing that any ſuch concluſion from his principles was unreaſonable. How ſhall we (ſaith the Apoſtle) who are dead unto ſin, live any longer therein? Special diſtinguiſhing, Free-Grace both <hi>deadneth the Soul to Sin,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flameth the Soul with a love to God, who hath made the Soul to differ; ſo as that Soul cannot live as other men, the <hi>love of God conſtraineth him,</hi> he muſt apprehend himſelf obliged to do more for God than others, becauſe God hath ſhewen more mercy to him than unto others; and that meerly becauſe he would ſhew mercy. What can poſſibly be imagined to have a greater, and lay an higher obligation upon the Soul, to all manner of holineſs in converſation, to perfect holineſs in the fear of the Lord, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh.</p>

                  <p>I Am now come to the ſecond general Propoſition, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed you to diſcourſe upon a little. In my laſt exerciſe, I diſcourſed to you of the <hi>Fountain of Life and Grace,</hi> which we found to be the free-will of God: There is no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be given of Gods ſhewing mercy, but <hi>becauſe he will ſhew mercy,</hi> which is moſt certainly true, as of Gods eternal acts of Grace, ſo of his Acts of Providence, as to the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <hi>firſt Grace.</hi> The next Propoſition I mentioned was this,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Prop. That God in his providential Diſpenſations of puniſhment never acteth by meer Prerogative, but according to the demerit of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> In his Diſpenſations of Grace, and the means of it, <hi>he acteth meerly from his own Will: he will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy;</hi> and there is no other account to be given of thoſe Diſpenſations, he ſendeth the Goſpel to this place, rather than another, becauſe he will ſend it; he changeth this Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans heart, and turneth it to himſelf, becauſe he will ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: But the caſe is otherwiſe in his penal Diſpenſations; there God acteth not upon <hi>Prerogative.</hi> God there hath a Prerogative; for <hi>may not the Potter</hi> do what he will with his Clay? But it is one thing to have <hi>Jus abſolutum,</hi> an abſolute right, and power which we muſt claim for God, ſo long as we know him to have an abſolute right, and Soveraignty over the works of his hands; 'tis ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing for God <hi>agere ſecundum jus abſolutum,</hi> to act according to his Soveraignty, and abſolute power: this we ſay God doth
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:192227:362"/>not. I pray obſerve: I reſtrain my Diſcourſe, to <hi>Gods Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of actual Providence:</hi> I ſhall not meddle with the <hi>eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of God</hi> in this caſe, that is quite beyond my Subject propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. It is unqueſtionable, that the puniſhments of Sinners, both in this Life, and that which is to come, as well as the other great iſſues of his Providence, concerning the rewards of righteous men, were ſet in order by an Eternal deliberation; but whether by a meer <hi>negative,</hi> or <hi>poſitive Decree;</hi> whether upon <hi>conſideration of ſin,</hi> or no, are points I am not at all concerned to intereſt my ſelf in; having all along reſtrained my diſcourſe to the motions of <hi>Actual Providence:</hi> and certain it is, that God in thoſe Diſpenſations, doth puniſh none either here, or hereafter, meerly becauſe he will, but upon conſideration of Sinners demerits. Shewing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is an <hi>Act of Grace;</hi> puniſhments, are Acts of Juſtice. The gift of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is Eternal Life, that is a guift; and what is freer than gift? But the <hi>Wages of Sin, is Death;</hi>

I <hi>underſtand it of all kind of deſtructions:</hi> poſſibly, the Text may chiefly relate to temporal deſtructions, 'tis <hi>Ephraim</hi> to whom the Prophet is ſpeaking; and it is about a bodily deſtruction: but the Concluſion is general, and the Text is well enough apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divines, to Eternal deſtruction; all deſtructions, whether of Body, or Soul, are of our ſelves; yea, I take the Aphonimy of the Text, to be more eminently true, of the deſtruction of the Soul, than of the deſtruction of the Body. A Child may dye for the ſins of the Parents, Subjects may dye for the ſin of their Prince; as in the caſe of <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Children,</hi> that were hanged in <hi>David</hi>'s time, and in the caſe of thoſe many thouſands, which in <hi>David</hi>'s time were cut off for his ſin in numbring of the People. The Children of God may be involved in a common deſtruction, and ſuffer as they are a part of a ſinful Nation; God may take them off, to deliver them from an evil to come, as in the caſe of <hi>Abijam</hi> the Son of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> God may puniſh his people with afflictions of this Life, for the trial, and exerciſe of their graces; but in Eternal deſtructions, God can have no other end, than the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the perſon, and all ſuch deſtruction, is for a mans ſin; his perſonal ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="635" facs="tcp:192227:362"/>3. When we ſay, that <hi>Mens deſtruction is of themſelves,</hi> you muſt underſtand, <hi>of themſelves as the meritorious cauſe;</hi> not of themſelves, as the <hi>principal efficient cauſe.</hi> God is rightly enough entituled, to all the Evil of puniſhment in the City. It is no diſhonour to his Majeſty, to be the <hi>Author of his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> which is all, that Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> or any of the ſame mind with him, have ſaid; which hath made ſome ſo clamour againſt them, as having aſſerted God to <hi>be the Author of Sin.</hi> For God to be the Author of puniſhments, is no ſtain to his Glory; but a Declaration of his Juſtice, and of his Righteouſneſs. Chriſt himſelf ſhall come (as the Apoſtle telleth us) in flaming fire, to take Vengeance upon them who know not God; and obey not his glorious Goſpel. God ſhall ſay to thoſe on his left hand, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me you curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> But our deſtruction is from our ſelves, as the proximate, and meritorious cauſe; though from God as the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe. It is not from the Soveraign will of God meerly, but from the ſtubborn and rebellious will of Man, that any Soul periſheth. Divines do ſay, that though God cannot will the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Sin, yet he may will that it ſhould be done. The Holy Ghoſt telleth us, that <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the Jews, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in accuſing, condemning, crucifying of Chriſt; did <hi>no more, than what the Council of God had determined ſhould be done.</hi> But I ſay, notwithſtanding this, the proximate cauſe of mans Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is not, becauſe God hath willed their Damnation; it is the guilt of their own Sins, the demerit of their own Tranſgreſſions, which bringeth them to the Pit of Deſtruction. The Gracious God ſheweth mercy, and ſaveth all who are ſaved by Prerogative; by <hi>Grace you are ſaved,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: he hath the ſame Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative in matters of Death, that he hath in matters of Life; but he uſeth it not, but there acteth according to his Statute-Law, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth ſhall dye.</hi> He who ſaveth men without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, damneth none without themſelves. Men are <hi>ſaved by Grace,</hi> but they are damned <hi>by Sin. The wages of Sin is Death. Omne peccatum eſt voluntarium,</hi> all Sin is of ourſelves, it muſt have ſomething of our own will, and conſent to, and in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly. <hi>Although this be certain, that all deſtruction, all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is for Sin, yet the particular proximate cauſe of ſome puniſhments is unknown to us.</hi> I will inſtance in one particular, a puniſhment, undoubtedly, a moſt ſevere puniſhment; <hi>The withholding the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:192227:363"/>and ſo the ordinary means of Grace and Salvation, from the far greateſt part of the world.</hi> They hear nothing of the Lord Jeſus; they have not the Oracles of God, the ordinary means of Grace are hidden from them; There is no doubt, but their own wilful ſinning is the cauſe of it. But whether the Sin of their Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who had the Goſpel, and ſinned it away, which to me ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a little hard; (for I can hardly be brought to agree, that God for the <hi>ſins of Relations</hi> puniſheth their Correlates in Spiritual things.) Or that prodigious ſinning, which they are guilty of; not living up to what may by them, by their natural Light be ſeen of God; (for the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. gives you a true Copy of the lives of all Heathens) is not ſo eaſie to determine. I ſhould incline much to fix the cauſe here, they have (though not the Book of Scripture) yet the Book of Gods Works, and Nature; (though not Men Miniſters of the Goſpel to them) yet the Heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the Glory of God, and the Earth ſhewing his handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; thoſe ſtanding Preachers, of the Power, Glory, and Greatneſs of God; whoſe ſound is gone out, and going day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out, over all the world: they have the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon;</hi> they ſee much of God, in and by them, and may learn much of God from them: but knowing God, and not glorifying him as God, but becoming vain in their imaginations; they worſhip Devils, and Stocks, and Stones, the work of their own hands; and ſhutting their eyes againſt the Light of thoſe common notions, which are engraven in all reaſonable Natures; they give up themſelves to commit all filthineſs, and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So not uſing the Light of Nature and Reaſon, which God hath given them, God juſtly with-holdeth from them the Talent of the Goſpel. If God doth grant it to others, which yet it may be are guilty of the ſame ſottiſh abuſe of their natural Light, and Reaſon, therein he is good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; but if he denieth it unto them, therein he is not unjuſt or unrighteous. But I ſay, there may be ſome particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as to which it may be hard for us to aſſign what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins God ſo ſecurely proceedeth againſt the Nations, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, or Perſons for: but this is certain, Sin is certainly the next cauſe of all ſevere diſpenſations of puniſhment. Now this will appear to us. 1. From <hi>the evidence of</hi> Scripture. 2. From <hi>the evidence of Reaſon, concluding from Scripture-Principles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="637" facs="tcp:192227:363"/>1. Firſt, from the <hi>plain evidence of Scripture.</hi> In the caſe of the Heathen, amongſt whom the Devil hath the greateſt harveſt of periſhing Souls: of theſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men:</hi> Obſerve the words, God doth not reveal his wrath againſt the Heathen, meerly upon the account of his <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> becauſe he will do it; but <hi>againſt the ungodlineſs and unrighteruſneſs of men:</hi> he goeth on declaring their <hi>ungodlineſs,</hi> and their <hi>unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Verſ. 21. <hi>Becauſe when they knew God, they glorified him not as God.</hi> They had light enough from the Works of God in Nature, to ſhew them other kind of Ideas of the Divine Being, than it was poſſible for them to find amongſt created beings; but they turned the Incorruptible God into the image of a <hi>corruptible man,</hi> yea, of <hi>creeping</hi> things, and <hi>four-footed beaſts.</hi> The Apoſtle telleth them alſo of their unrighteouſneſs, Verſ. 29. <hi>Fornication, wickedneſs, covetouſneſs, malitiouſneſs; they were full of envy, murders, debates, deceits,</hi> &amp;c. Now for theſe things the wrath of God was revealed againſt them. The Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, <hi>That when the Gentiles, which have not the Law, do by nature the things which are contained in the Law, they are a Law to themſelves.</hi> And Verſ. 26. <hi>If the uncircumciſion keep the Law, their uncircumciſion ſhall be accounted to them for circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> I am not of their mind, who think that the Heathen have <hi>light enough</hi> to ſhew them the way to Heaven. I know not,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.2. Mat. 4.16. Luk. 1.7, 9.</note> if that were true, why the Scripture ſhould ſet them out under the notion of perſons, or people that <hi>ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death;</hi> until <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>the day-ſpring from on high, hath viſited them:</hi> But I am ſure they have ſin enough to juſtifie God in damning them; and permitting them to walk in their own ways, until they have filled up the meaſure of their iniquities, and brought judgment upon themſelves. I alſo believe, that if there be found a <hi>Job</hi> in the Land of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z;</hi> If there be one found amongſt the Heathen, who <hi>feareth God, and eſcheweth evil;</hi> who walketh up to his natural light; God hath his ſecret way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, and apply Chriſt to them, ſo as he ſhall not periſh. But yet I cannot believe that his natural light ſhall ſave him, becauſe the Scripture telleth us, <hi>That there is no other name under heaven, than the name of Jeſus Chriſt, by which any can be ſaved; neither is there Salvation in any other.</hi> There are ſeveral things in nature that we know are ſo, but we do not know the way of them. In the
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:192227:364"/>matters of grace there are ſeveral things alſo which we underſtand not the way of God in: Three come into my mind at preſent. <hi>The way of God with an infant,</hi> we are not ſure that all infants, no, not that all Baptized infants ſhall be ſaved; but we doubt not, but of many ſuch is the Kingdom of God: but for the way of God with the Soul of one that liveth not up to the exerciſes of reaſon, and the intelligentneſs of the ordinary means of Faith, and Regeneration; this we do not underſtand. 2. <hi>The way of God with a thief upon the Croſs,</hi> I mean with a ſinner forgetting, or neglecting to turn unto God until his laſt hour; we do believe that God hath mercy upon ſome ſuch Souls, but how God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them theſe habits of grace, which are neceſſary according to the ordinary rule; how they are born again of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and Baptized, not with water only, but <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>with fire:</hi> this we do not underſtand. And ſo Thirdly, <hi>The way of God with an Heathen,</hi> that never cometh to the light of the Goſpel, nor hath any external Revelation of Chriſt: I ſay, how the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God moveth, and which way it cometh into ſuch a Soul; this we do not underſtand, but leave it amongſt the unſearchable things of Divine Providence, which we believe and revere: If there be (as I ſaid before) a <hi>Job</hi> in the Land of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z, he ſhall know that his Redeemer lives, and that he ſhall ſtand at the laſt day upon the earth, and he ſhall ſee him with his eyes:</hi> But which way God revealeth this to him, we underſtand not. In the mean time theſe hidden things being left to God, <hi>revealed things belong to us and to our children;</hi> and this is revealed: That the wrath of God, as to the Heathen, is revealed againſt the ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But this is much more evident concerning ſuch as live <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the means of grace, and offers of ſalvation:</hi> Oh <hi>Jeruſalem, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem!</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>how often would I have gathered thee as an Hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but thou wouldeſt not?</hi> I would, what hindered then? <hi>thou wouldeſt not.</hi> Thus God of old ſpake to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Jer. 23.24. <hi>This thing I commanded you, ſaying, obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people, and walk you in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you: But they hearkned not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counſels and imaginations of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.13. and in a multitude of places in Scripture: Indeed this is the Language of God quite
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:192227:364" rendition="simple:additions"/>throughout Scripture. So in the New Teſtament, <hi>You would not come to me that you might have life,</hi> Joh. 5.40. I hear ſome bold Diſputer againſt God, ſaying, <hi>How is this poſſible,</hi> if it lyeth not in the power of a man to believe, and to turn unto God? I have fully anſwered this before. All mankind in <hi>Adam</hi> certainly had a power to do ſo much as God required of man in order to his Salvation; but certain it is, that every man hath a power to do ſomething; to do much more than he doth in order to his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and believing: God will find at the day of Judgment, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough to condemn ſinners for what was their duty to have done, and in their power to have done; and an inſtance will be wanting at that great day of one Soul, who did what was in his power; both as to the doing of Good, and the avoiding of ſin; to whom God denied his ſpecial, and effectual grace: Chriſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.32. <hi>Layeth this to the Jews charge,</hi> That when they had heard <hi>John, they repented not afterward, that they might believe:</hi> But this is a theam I have before inlarged upon, and ſhall now add nothing to that Diſcourſe. Having thus far opened the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall only give you Two Reaſons of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>That no imputation might be laid upon an holy, a moſt holy God:</hi> Though the Scripture doth juſtly aſſert a <hi>Soveraignty to God</hi> concerning the work of his hands, and the ſame power over his creature, which the Potter hath over the clay; yet it every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where avoideth all imputations of rigour, injuſtice, cruelty; God will not be accounted an <hi>hard Maſter:</hi> what if this man hath but one Talent, another hath five, and a third hath ten; yet I hope he that hath but one, may trade proportionably to that one, as far as that will go; and if he doth not, and he be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Maſter is not to be condemned for an hard Maſter, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that one Talent from him; or otherwiſe puniſhing him for the non-improvement of the ſtock betruſted to him: Suppoſe men to have but the <hi>one Talent,</hi> of the <hi>light of Nature,</hi> which is the caſe of the poor Heathens; another to have <hi>five Talents,</hi> the advantage of Goſpel-light, and the ordinary means of grace; a third to have <hi>ten Talents, effectual grace</hi> ſuperadded to both theſe: If he who hath but one Talent, or that hath had the five Talents, have not done with them what he might have done; and God condemn him for ſuch omiſſions, or actions contrary to his duty; here can be no imputation upon God, he cannot be ſaid to have done cruelly, ſeverely, or injuſtly. God was under no obligation
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:192227:365"/>to truſt him with <hi>five Talents,</hi> that abuſed, or would make no good uſe of one; nor to truſt him with <hi>ten Talents,</hi> who would not uſe, or did abuſe his ſive; but now ſhould God have puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or condemned any without their ſins as the meritorious cauſe, there might have been ſome imputation upon God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, God hath ſo ordered it, That the ſinner <hi>ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable:</hi> It is but reaſonable, that the holy God ſhould ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe out his puniſhments by the hand of Providence, that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould be <hi>without excuſe;</hi> this the Scripture lets us know once and again. In the Parable it is ſaid, That he who was turned out from the Wedding-feaſt for want of the Wedding-garment, was <hi>ſpeechleſs;</hi> he was without an Apology, he had nothing to ſay for himſelf. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Then they are without excuſe.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Therefore thou art inexcuſable, O man:</hi> This is one deſign that God drives, ſo to manage and govern by the motions of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Now ſuppoſing this, that <hi>all deſtruction is of a mans ſelf:</hi> That God doth not condemn any out of <hi>meer Prerogative,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he will,</hi> (whatever he might do, <hi>vi abſoluti juris</hi>) every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt ſtop his mouth, and be ſpeechleſs in that day, when God ſhall ſay, <hi>Take them, bind them hand and foot, and caſt them into utter darkneſs, where is weeping and wailing, and guaſhing of teeth.</hi> What hath any ſinner to ſay for himſelf, if his deſtruction be of himſelf? I have done with the doctrinal part of this Diſcourſe, I come to apply it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> In the firſt place, <hi>obſerve the great difference between Gods proceedings in the methods of his grace, and of his paenal diſpenſations;</hi> diſpenſations of mercy and judgment, are both Gods work: But the one is his <hi>Natural</hi> work, the other is his ſtrange work, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.21. Gods workings in the methods of his grace, are, <hi>ex me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro ſuo motu &amp; beneplacito,</hi> they meerly flow from the nature of God, without any meritorious cauſe in the creature; he ſheweth mercy becauſe he will ſhew mercy, and extendeth compaſſion to whom he will, and becauſe he will extend compaſſion; he giveth grace becauſe he will give grace: here God acteth from meer So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and Prerogative; but he never dealeth out puniſhments, but there is ſome cauſe in the creature, ſomething which moveth him to proceed and deal in ſuch a manner, and meriteth ſuch a puniſhment: He ſaveth Souls becauſe he is gracious, he condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſinners becauſe he is righteous, <hi>cum largitur gratiam per miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordiam hoc fit, cum negat, per judicium,</hi> ſaith <hi>Nieremberg,</hi> wrath is
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:192227:365"/>not declared, ſaith he, unleſs when it is due, leſt there ſhould be unrighteouſneſs with God; mercy is ſhewed, when and where it is not due; this maketh no unrighteouſneſs with him: So that I ſay, there is a vaſt difference to be obſerved betwixt Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of mercy and goodneſs, and his diſpenſations of wrath and ſeverity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> In the ſecond place, you may from hence conclude; <hi>How little reaſon there is for that clamour, which ſome make againſt ſuch as are called Calviniſts;</hi> under which nick-name, they indeed wound, not only <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Proſper,</hi> and others of the ancients; but many Divines in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially that lived three, or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years a go. Two great Accuſations they bring:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they affirm God to <hi>be the Author of ſin;</hi> yet neither Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor any of his Followers ever ſaid ſo, nor dare any now ſay ſo: What's the matter then? becauſe they ſay, <hi>That God hath willed, that ſin ſhould be committed, though he hath neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nor approved the action, nor any way influenced it by the way of efficiency:</hi> Therefore God muſt be the Author, or theſe Divines make him the Author: Or <hi>becauſe God is the Author of his own judgments, and paenal diſpenſations;</hi> and God ſometimes puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſin with ſin; therefore God muſt be the <hi>Author of ſin:</hi> taken properly as it is an oblique action, contrary to his Law. This is (forſooth) their proof of that crimination; when-as there are no Divines in the world, but think it, not only <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> but <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe,</hi> to talk of God as the Author of <hi>ſin;</hi> which muſt be an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contrary to the <hi>will,</hi> liking, and approbation of God, as the very nature of ſin doth import.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their ſecond Crimination, is, <hi>That God hath damn'd his creatures, out of his meer Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty.</hi> We do indeed think, and muſt ſo think, till our Adverſaries can poſſeſs us with other Idea's and notions of God, than either Scripture, or reaſon will help us with; That there is nothing which either hath, or ſhall come to paſs in the world, but God did know from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; neither can we conceive how God ſhould know any thing, but becauſe he willed it; either in a way of <hi>efficiency,</hi> or to <hi>permit it.</hi> We do ſay, that God had a <hi>jus abſolutum,</hi> from eternity; an abſolute right over his creatures, to determine how he pleaſed concerning them: But we alſo ſay, <hi>That in his paenal diſpenſations he acteth not according to his Soveraignty and abſolute right;</hi> and that every mans deſtruction is of himſelf; and the proximate, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:192227:366"/>cauſe of the puniſhment, and eternal ruin of any Soul, is his own ſin: God doth not condemn any Soul, but for ſin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſing their own iniquities upon their heads; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is abſolute and Soveraign right, his Law, from which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver varieth, in the motions of his Providence, is, <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die.</hi> Where is the difference then? What maketh this great clamour, and odious repreſentation of eminent Divines, as to the method of Gods proceedings in his actual Providence? <hi>Papiſts, Arminians, Calviniſts,</hi> all are agreed, <hi>That the wages of ſin is death, The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die:</hi> God will condemn none but for ſin. Only it ſeems they are not agreed, as to the <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Attributes,</hi> and <hi>Prerogatives of God.</hi> Thoſe Divines whom they call <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> muſt aſſert God to have the ſame Power over his creatures, which a <hi>Potter hath over the clay:</hi> This the other will not underſtand, though God expreſsly told it the Prophet <hi>Jeremy;</hi> and the Apoſtle from him hath expreſsly told it us: and this is all the difference that I can underſtand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Thirdly, you may from hence learn, <hi>How the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God ſhall be cleared in the laſt day, in the condemnation of ſinners, although it hath not pleaſed him to give to all a power to that which is truly, and Spiritually good.</hi> This is a point which very many in this Generation alſo will not underſtand, but the fault is in themſelves. If God (ſay they) hath not given to all men a power to <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>to believe,</hi> how ſhall he be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the condemning of Sinners? There is no conſequence at all in this, but upon this <hi>Hypotheſis:</hi> That except men have a power to do that which is Spiritually good, they are in no capacity to do that which is morally evil. Whether they have a power to repent, or to believe, without the effectual Grace of God, yea, or no; Certainly, they have a power in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things, to break the Law of God; yea, and to do alſo many things which are contained in the Law of God: and although the doing of theſe things would not ſave them, yet certainly, the omiting of them, or doing contrary to them, may give God a righteous cauſe to condemn them. Suppoſe one of you who are Fathers, to have two Sons, both of them wild, and fond of their play, and eager at it; you call them both to come to you, and tell them, that if they will come, you will give them both mony to go and buy ſuch things; but if by ſuch a time, they have not thoſe things, and appear
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:192227:366"/>to you in, and with them, you will certainly whip them. One of theſe Children hearkens to you, leaves his play, comes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to you, and begs the money you promiſed him; then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the things, and appeareth to you in the habit you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and you are well pleaſed with him. The other Child, is mad of his play (which if he would he might leave) he could not have the things without mony out of his Fathers Purſe; but he will not leave his play, nor ſtir a foot towards his Father, nor ſo much as ask his Father for mony; his Father indeed, ſends him no mony, but ſhuts him out of his ſight; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth him to be ſeverely whipt, becauſe that he would not leave his idle game, and come to him, and ask the mony of him which he promiſed; and becauſe he had not bought the things, and appeared before him, in that habit, and dreſs, which he had commanded: will not one ſay, this fooliſh Child, is right ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? ſhall his Father be judged unrighteous or ſevere, becauſe he gave the Child no mony (as he did the other) and the Child could come by the things without mony, and if it had them not, could not appear in, or with them, before his Father? The caſe is much the ſame, betwixt God and us. God ſeeth two Men, or Women, both his Creatures, <hi>alike in Adam,</hi> both born in Treſpaſſes and Sins; wildly playing over the hole of the Asp, and the den of the Cockatrice; ſporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Sin, and in an hourly danger of Hell-fire: God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them by his Miniſters, to leave their Sins, and to turn unto him; he ſaith, let him that hath been drunk, be drunk no more; let him that hath been unclean, be unclean no more; let him that hath told a lye, that hath <hi>broke my Sabbaths,</hi> lye, and break my Sabbaths no more; let him read my Word, and hear my Word; and let him come, and pray unto me, and beg of me, an heart to believe and to repent, and I will give it him; and he that <hi>believeth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> but in the great day, it ſhall be found, That he who hath <hi>not repented, and hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ſhall be damned.</hi> One of theſe ſinners, leaveth off his leud courſes, falls to an external Diſcipline, readeth the Word, heareth the Word of God, applyeth himſelf to God by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, beggeth of God an heart to repent, and to believe his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: God hears him, gives him a power, gives him repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto Life, and a ſaving Faith in Chriſt; and he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth everlaſting Salvation. The other is mad of his Luſts,
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:192227:367"/>and after them he will go, let what will be the iſſue of it; he will not read the Word, not hear that his Soul may live; nor ſo much as ask ſpecial Grace of God, not to plead with God for Faith, or Repentance; God giveth them not to him, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his impenitency and unbelief: God throweth him into Hell, for his not repenting, not believing, according to his Word. Is there any unrighteouſneſs with God in this caſe, more than in the Fathers dealing with the Child, upon the former Suppoſition? What pretence is there for it? The Sinner, you will ſay, could not repent, could not believe, without the ſpecial Grace of God, which was never given him. No more could the Child buy thoſe things the Father willed it to have, and come before him with, unleſs the Father firſt gave it mony; the Child had no mony of its own: But the Child might have left its play, it might have read, and heard the Word, he might have come to God by Prayer; and begg'd of him a ſoft, and contrite heart, and a believing heart, he had power to do all this; and had he done this, God had not been wanting to him in his further Grace. <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given</hi> ((ſaith our Saviour) that is, to him that <hi>hath, and uſeth, and proveth what Gifts and Graces he hath as he ought to do, ſhall be given more Grace.</hi> But this the poor wretch hath not done, but dieth an hard-hearted, an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and unbelieving wretch; what <hi>unrighteouſneſs is there with God</hi> in his condemnation? he periſheth in his own iniquity; his blood is upon his own head, his damnation lieth at his own door, his deſtruction is of himſelf, his help might have been from God, if he had not been wanting to himſelf. O ſinful men, <hi>are not the Lords ways equal?</hi> Yes, yes, they are our own ways that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal; the ſtraight ways of the Lord, are only made crooked, by our idle fancies, our proud hearts, and corrupt reaſons, and fooliſh miſpriſions.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. In the laſt place, let me apply this diſcourſe, by way of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> it will afford matter of Exhortation. 1. To the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</hi> 2. To the <hi>men of the World,</hi> thoſe I mean that are not yet converted unto God. 1. To Gods People.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To you it ſpeaketh, <hi>to make you more afraid of ſin for the time to come.</hi> Sin in Scripture is ordinarily reſembled by ſickneſs, and a diſeaſe. Now what is true of ſickneſs is true of Sin, every ſickneſs is not unto death; but every ſickneſs hath ſomething of death in it; it leadeth to the Grave: it is not the laſt ſtroke, at
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:192227:367"/>the giving of which, the Tree falleth; but it is a blow, in order to the fall of it. Every ſin doth not bring forth death; yea as to you, <hi>No ſin</hi> ſhall bring forth death; becauſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. There is no condemnation to them that are in Jeſus Chriſt; but every ſin hath ſomething of the nature of a <hi>ſelf-ruining,</hi> and <hi>deſtruction</hi> in it. <hi>The wages of every ſin is death;</hi> the natural tendency of every ſin is unto death. It is the Gift and Free-Grace of God that as to you prevents it; and although your ſins do not bring forth an Eternal ruine and deſtruction to you, becauſe the Blood of Chriſt, and the Interceſſion of Chriſt hath prevented, and will prevent that; yet your ſins may bring forth many leſſer deaths to you: for them, you may be <hi>in deaths often;</hi> for them there may be a death of your peace, and comforts: as there are no temporal Evils, which ſin may not bring upon the people of God; ſo there are few ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Evils on this ſide of Hell, to which it doth not ſubject them: So that although you be not under the danger of an Eternal ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, yet you are under the danger of ſo many deaths, ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as may juſtly lay a Law upon you, and make you afraid of ſinning againſt God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Secondly, This <hi>calleth to all of you, to admire the Divine Grace by which you are ſaved.</hi> I hope it is the portion of many of you to whom I am ſpeaking, you are not yet got up to the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> but you are in the right way that leadeth thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. O cry, <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> unto the hand which ſet you upon that Shore. It is true of you, you alſo by ſin had deſtroyed your ſelves, by Grace you are ſaved; you were once Fire-brands, as well as any others; are you now brands pluckt out of the Fire? It was the hand of Grace, that pluck'd you out. <hi>You hath he quickned</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1.) <hi>who were dead in Treſpaſſes and ſins. Amongſt whom alſo we had our converſation of old according to the Luſts of the Fleſh;</hi> you alſo were once acted by the Prince of the Air, who yet worketh in the Children of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and were by Nature, the Children of Wrath, as much as others. It is a ſweet, though in ſome ſence, a bitter medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to caſt a thought back, and think, Lord! How had I alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed my ſelf? How near was I going to the Pit of Eternal ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and deſtruction? Nay, how often yet is our Salvation from God? We are every day deſtroying our ſelves, we lye down with ſin enough to juſtify God in deſtroying us before the Morning; and riſe up every day with ſin enough to juſtify God in deſtroying
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:192227:368"/>us before the Evening. <hi>By Grace we are ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Secondly, let me ſpeak to thoſe which can have no ſuch good hope through Grace. They yet are in their natural State and condition, in the Gall of bitterneſs, and in the very bands of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Sirs, it is that which I have often told you, and I wiſh the ſound of it may never be out of your Ears; you are Creatures or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to Eternity, when you dye, you dye not like brute-Beaſts; Death will not determine your beings, you ſhall be either Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy, or Eternally miſerable: All that I have to ſay to you, is to <hi>plead with you, that you would not ruine your ſelves;</hi> and let me tell you, that if ever you periſh, it muſt be becauſe you have deſtroyed your ſelves. Do not fright your ſelves with thoughts of Gods eternal decrees: ſecret things belong to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed things to us. Whatever Gods ſecret counſels and purpoſes be, this is his revealed will; <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, and that alone ſhall dye.</hi> Trouble not your ſelves with any ſuch thoughts as theſe, <hi>If I be not elected, do what I will, I ſhall be damned;</hi> If God hath caſt me off, I ſhall labour in vain; It is the Sluggard (ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) which ſaith, <hi>There is a Lion in the way.</hi> We cannot <hi>aſcend up into Heaven,</hi> to ſearch Gods Books, there is no need of it. The Word is near us, even in our mouths; that telleth us, that God never deſtroyeth any Soul, but the meritorious cauſe of it is in himſelf: and this we know, that <hi>all ſin is voluntary;</hi> O then, take heed of deſtroying your ſelves, by wilful, and preſumptuous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God. Nature teacheth every Man, to look to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to his Life, Health, Eſtate; and ſhall not our reaſonable Nature, inſtructed by the Word of God, prompt us to take care of our ſelves, as to our Eternal Intereſt? You will ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, what ſhall we do, that we may not de <hi>deſtroyed;</hi> for who liveth, and ſinneth not againſt God? I have before told you, that in Scripture I find three Anſwers to this Queſtion. The one is that of St. <hi>Peters,</hi> Acts 2.31. <hi>Repent and be Baptized;</hi> another is that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 16.31. <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> The other, is that of our Saviour, to the young Man, asking him, <hi>What good thing he ſhould do, that he might inherit Everlaſting Life.</hi> Saith our Saviour, <hi>Keep the Commandments.</hi> Thoſe three Texts will give you compleat directions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Keep the Commandments.</hi> You will reply, but you tell us, that no Man is able to keep the Commandments; but becauſe you cannot do all which God doth require, can you do nothing?
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:192227:368"/>Well, but you will ſay, Shall we be ſaved if we do all that we can to keep the Moral Law? I Anſwer, No, What then?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells you, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent, and be Baptized:</hi> you will reply, but it is God who muſt <hi>give repentance unto life.</hi> True, we ſay, God muſt change the heart; <hi>the Blackamore cannot change his skin, nor the Leopard his ſpots:</hi> But cannot you conſider your ſins? Cannot you turn from open ſins? Do what in you lieth in order to your Repentance: Well, but you will ſay, If we do this, Is this enough? I Anſwer, No, What then?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth you, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and you ſhall be ſaved:</hi> Still, you will ſay, But is not <hi>Faith the gift of God?</hi> Have we a power to believe? We Anſwer, No, It muſt be given to men on the <hi>behalf of Chriſt to believe;</hi> But cannot you read the Word of God? Cannot you come and hear the Word preached? When you have heard it, Cannot you meditate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Cannot you apply your ſouls to the Word, though it be Gods work to apply the Word to your ſouls, and make it to dwell in you? Cannot you beg of God a power to believe? God will not be wanting to that ſoul, that is not firſt wanting to it ſelf. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt us, and the bold Patrons of free-will, lies here: They hold, <hi>that a man hath a natural power and ability to actions formally, and ſpiritually good:</hi> This we deny, but yet ſay, <hi>That man hath a power to actions that are morally, and materially good:</hi> and if he would go about as far as his Natural power would help him, though indeed he could merit nothing at the hand of God; We do not believe, that God would be wanting to him, as to habits of ſpiritual and effectual grace. Now this is that which I am pleading with you for, that you might not deſtroy you ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That you would not give your ſelf a liberty, and let your ſelves looſe to do things contrary to the Law of God, wherein you might reſtrain your ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That you would not neglect to do thoſe things which God requireth of you, and which are in your power to do. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this, but with Two very weighty conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>No puniſhment is more juſtly and ſmartly inflicted, than that which a man hath choſen,</hi> and wilfully brought upon himſelf; when a man hath choſen death rather than life, and judged himſelf unworthy of everlaſting life, and deſpiſed his own mercy; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every man muſt ſay, he is juſtly puniſhed, and adjudged to that portion which he hath choſen to himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="648" facs="tcp:192227:369"/>2. Secondly, As no puniſhment is ſo juſtly and ſmartly infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>ſo none is more intolerable to be born.</hi> There will be in Hell another fire which ſhall never go out; but this will be the worm that ſhall never die: I have done, and ſhall ſhut up my Diſcourſe with the words of <hi>Moſes: I have this day ſet before you life and death, bleſſing and curſing.</hi> I have told you which way you muſt go down into the pit of deſtruction, if ever you come there; you muſt of your ſelves go into it: O let not your deſtruction be of your ſelves, eſpecially conſidering what God hath done, and what he is daily doing; to evidence that in him is your help, if you will apply your ſelves unto him.</p>

                  <p>THE buſineſs I am upon (as you know) is the expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome hard Chapters in the Book of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; I am upon the laſt <hi>head,</hi> upon which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to ſpeak to ſome appearing difficulties, <hi>viz. Gods unequal diſpenſations of Grace,</hi> whether ſuch as are more <hi>common,</hi> or ſuch as are more <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>ſaving,</hi> as a baſis to this Diſcourſe: I have premiſed, and handled Two preliminary Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Prop.</hi> That God in the diſpenſations of his grace, <hi>acteth by Prerogative in a way of Soveraignty, freely, and unaccountably.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prop. <hi>That in his paenal diſpenſations of this nature, he never proceedeth but juſtly upon the previous demerits of ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I now come to ſpeak to ſome Queſtions relating to theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:192227:369"/>of Divine Providence. The Two firſt of this nature, which I ſhall ſpeak to, relate to Gods unequal diſtributions of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace,</hi> but ſuch as are ſpiritual means, in order to the obtaining of ſpecial and effectual grace; and his unequal diſtributions of <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>effectual grace,</hi> without which none can be ſaved: I ſhall put both theſe together, and for a ſhort Diſcourſe upon theſe, I have made choice of this Text.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs of the Apoſtle in this excellent <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> is to eſtabliſh the great Doctrine of the Goſpel, concerning <hi>the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſoul before God by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> on Gods part imputed, and reckoned to ſinners; and on mans part, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and applied by Faith; in oppoſition to the Doctrine of the Doctors of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who held the Juſtification of the Soul by the <hi>works of the Law:</hi> In oppoſition to whom he had laid down his grand Propoſition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>That the righteouſneſs of God is revealed from faith to faith:</hi> That is, That righteouſneſs wherein a Soul another day, muſt ſtand juſt and righteous before God, is not a righteouſneſs of our own, ariſing from our performance of the Law; but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt revealed in the Goſpel, which is apprehended, and made ours by Faith. His firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which he proveth this, is, obvious to any conſiderate <hi>Reader:</hi> If any be juſtified by works, they muſt either be the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> or the <hi>Jews;</hi> but neither are the works of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſuch, as will juſtifie them: Nor are the works of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſuch, as will juſtifie them. As to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he proveth at large, Chap. 1. That their works were ſuch, as were ſo far from Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them, <hi>That the wrath of God was revealed againſt them;</hi> for the wrath of God is revealed <hi>againſt all the ungodlineſs, and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of men;</hi> and, as he at large ſheweth, the works of the Heathen were works of moſt notorious ungodlineſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs; and therefore could not poſſibly juſtifie them. So in this Chapter he proveth that the works of the <hi>Jews</hi> were not ſuch, as could juſtifie them before God; for though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned others for ſins, yet they did as bad themſelves. From Verſ. 11. He taketh away all pretence of <hi>Juſtification by works,</hi> both from the <hi>Jews</hi> and from the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> For the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>they had not the Law;</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi> they indeed had the Law, but they broke it: Now, ſaith he, <hi>There is no reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with God,</hi> thoſe that ſin ſhall periſh; let them ſin <hi>with the Law,</hi> or <hi>without the Law: For</hi> (ſaith he in my Text) <hi>as many as
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:192227:370"/>have ſinned without Law, ſhall alſo periſh without Law, and as many as have ſinned in the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law.</hi> By the Law is here plainly underſtood the Word of God, which God hath given us to be <hi>a light unto our feet, and a lanthern to our paths;</hi> a light to ſhew us the way to Heaven: Here is plainly imply'd, That as ſome ſinners periſh having the Word of God, and the external means of Salvation; ſo others periſh having not the Law and Word of God, nor the outward and ordinary means which God hath appointed in order to the obtaining of eternal life and ſalvation. 2. In both theſe diſpenſations God is juſt, for there is no reſpect of perſons with God. Now hence ariſe Two Queſtions,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Queſt. <hi>Whether God granteth to all men ſufficient aids and aſſiſtances, or means of Grace in order to their Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Queſt. <hi>If God doth not grant unto all men ſufficient means, aids, and aſſiſtances of Grace, in order to their Salvation: how he can be juſt in the condemnation of any, to whom he hath not given, ſuch a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Queſt. <hi>Whether God granteth unto all men ſufficient means of Grace, in order to their Salvation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We affirm that he hath not. But here we have many Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, to encounter. There are ſome that affirm that there is a ſufficiency of the means, aids, and aſſiſtances of Grace afforded to all men in order to their Salvation. Some of the <hi>Arminians</hi> will not go thus far, but they affirm, <hi>That to all thoſe to whom the Goſpel is preached, and who are by the preaching of it called to Faith and Repentance, there is a ſufficient grace given.</hi> Thus far we do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as to this point of ſufficient grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in our firſt Parent <hi>Adam, all mankind had ſufficient grace,</hi> whether we reſpect external, or internal means; he had a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Revelation of the Will of God, and a ſufficient power in himſelf, in his own will; in the rectitude of his own nature, to have made uſe of, and apply'd the Revelation he had of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, in order to his Salvation; and ſo all mankind had in him: For as <hi>in Adam all died,</hi> ſo in <hi>Adam</hi> all men were at firſt a live, or they could not in the fall have died in him: The Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not therefore of man, as he at firſt came out of the hand of God, but of mankind in their lapſed eſtate, whether they have all ſuch a ſufficiency.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, Neither is the Queſtion about the ſufficiency of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means as to all thoſe to whom the Goſpel is preached, and who have
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:192227:370"/>the Scriptures;</hi> we grant a perfection in them, and that they are able to make men wiſe unto Salvation: the <hi>word of Faith,</hi> is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient external means; this is again on all hands agreed betwixt us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, It is out of doubt, <hi>that there is ſuch a Revelation of the means of grace, as is ſufficient for the manifeſtation of the Glory and Juſtice of God,</hi> which is the great end which God aimeth at in all his diſpenſations of Providence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yea, and Fourthly, There is ſuch a ſufficiency of <hi>outward means, as is enough to keep up external order, and diſcipline in the world, in humane Societies;</hi> and as will render men <hi>inexcuſable</hi> before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, We do grant that <hi>there is a ſufficiency of grace given to many that live in the world,</hi> even to as many as God hath fore-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternal life: But ſtill there are Two Queſtions behind.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether thoſe who never heard of Chriſt, to whom the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was never preached, have a ſufficient external means in order to their Salvation?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether either thoſe, or any of thoſe to whom the Goſpel is preached, have a ſufficiency of means in order to their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs God be pleaſed to influence their ſouls by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful operation of his Spirit upon their hearts, overpowering their wills, and in the day of his power making them willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt freely tendred in the Goſpel. We do judg, that as the Heathens, who have not heard of Chriſt, nor had the Goſpel preached unto them, have not a ſufficiency in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of outward, ordinary means; ſo neither thoſe who have the Scriptures, and Ordinances of God, have a <hi>ſufficiency of grace while they want the internal effectual operation of the Spirit of God.</hi> So that indeed no Reprobates, only the <hi>Elect of God,</hi> have a <hi>ſufficient</hi> aid and aſſiſtance of grace given them for their Salvation, though in the way of outward means; thoſe indeed who have the Goſpel publiſhed to them, may be ſaid to have a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> in reſpect of <hi>external means.</hi> This we affirm, upon theſe grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This pretended ſufficiency muſt be either of <hi>External</hi> means, or of <hi>Internal means, or of both:</hi> indeed it muſt be <hi>of both, or it is not a ſufficiency.</hi> The External means is the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the <hi>preaching of them;</hi> they are thoſe which are able to to make <hi>the man of God,</hi> (as Apoſtle tells us) <hi>wiſe unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And <hi>how ſhall they believe,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 10.)

                     <hi>on him of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? And how ſhall they Preach except they be ſent?</hi> The Apoſtle is there, diſcourſing of the ordinary means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: you ſee, that is fixed in the word, for that is, that which is to be <hi>heard,</hi> and the <hi>Preaching of the word.</hi> So that what ſecret way ſoever, God may have to reveal himſelf, and the knowledg of Chriſt, unto ſome particular perſons, in places where the Scriptures are not found, nor the name of Chriſt heard of, nor his Goſpel Preached; yet, certain it is, <hi>the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ordinary means</hi> of Salvation is the <hi>Preaching, hearing,</hi> and <hi>reading of the word,</hi> and the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. Now we know, that in the far greateſt part of the World, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not found, read, preached, they have no Miniſtry; and therefore it is very abſurd to ſay, That as to the <hi>External ordinary means of Salvation, there is a ſufficiency afforded all;</hi> for if the word, and the Miniſtry of it be the outward and ordinary, means; it is matter of demonſtration, that a very great part of the World hath nothing of it: thoſe therefore that will maintain a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of means, muſt make the <hi>works of God,</hi> and the <hi>view of them,</hi> and <hi>concluſions,</hi> which men may make by their Natural light and reaſon from them, a <hi>ſufficient means,</hi> to give a man the knowledg of God, and ſuch a knowledg as is ſufficient. And this indeed ſome do ſeem to ſay, When they find out for us another object for ſaving Faith than Chriſt and his Goſpel; and tell us, that <hi>Abel and Enoch</hi> excerciſed their Faith, and ſuch a Faith as pleaſed God; whoſe object was not Chriſt, but only ſuch Propoſitions as theſe, That God is, and <hi>that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him.</hi> This is indeed a new Doctrine in our Nation, but it is but a Tranſcript, of what the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi>

<pb n="653" facs="tcp:192227:371"/>cannot be ſaid, That God hath given to all means ſufficient. 2. But Secondly, For the more <hi>Spiritual Internal</hi> means, which is the effectual grace of God, it is certain; that is not given to all, for then all would be ſaved, (but of that more, by and by.) There are thoſe that think every man hath a <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> of <hi>inward Spiritual means,</hi> who liveth under the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel.

But the Scripture tels us, It is given <hi>to us on the behalf of Chriſt to believe;</hi> That <hi>Faith is not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God;</hi> with a multitude of Texts more of the like import: now moſt certain it is, that if there be any ſuch ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit neceſſary, all men have not a <hi>ſufficiency of means:</hi> If we be not ſufficient of our ſelves, to think one good thought, as the Apoſtle tels us: If without Chriſt, we can do nothing: If God muſt give to will and to do, what power hath man to any thing which is truly, and Spiritually good? For thoſe that ſit under the preaching of the Goſpel, they have all the ſame <hi>moral Suaſion;</hi> they have all the ſame rational powers, and faculties; how cometh it, I would fain know, to paſs, that one of them repents, and believeth, when others are hardned and continue lock't up in unbeleif? Is it from themſelves, that one mans will inclineth well, and not anothers? then ſurely there is another Principle of Spiritual life; another Fountain of good beſides God, which is plainly to contradict the Scripture, which every where maketh God the Fountain of life, and of all good. But this is the firſt thing only which I offer to you, in this cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, How is it poſſible, that all ſhould have ſufficient grace, <hi>but that all muſt be ſaved?</hi> God telleth St. Paul, 2 Cor. 12.9. <hi>My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee;</hi> was it poſſible, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that promiſe, he ſhould have been overborne, or overcome with his temptation? I would ask for what this pretended grace, given to all ſhould be <hi>ſufficient?</hi> Will they ſay for Salvation?
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:192227:372"/>How can any be ſaid, to have a ſufficiency of grace to ſave them, who yet are not ſaved, nor ever ſhall be ſaved? All that can be pretended, is, That every man, and woman, hath a reaſonable Soul; (that is not denied) and <hi>that is naturally endued, with power enough, to do whatſoever Spiritual action God hath required of man, in order to his obtaining Salvation;</hi> having either the <hi>works of God, to repreſent God unto him;</hi> (which is all that the Heathen have) or <hi>the word of God, the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which they may read, and hear preached.</hi> So that this ſame <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> which they contend for, is nothing elſe but a <hi>reaſonable Soul:</hi> The <hi>works of God in Nature, and the word of God in the Scriptures; or,</hi> at moſt preached to them. Thoſe who reſtrain <hi>ſufficiency of grace,</hi> to thoſe who have the Goſpel preached to them,

And deny that in the buſineſs of converſion, the holy Spirit putteth forth any other power; and they ſay, There is more force in the word of Reconciliation, than in a <hi>Lazare prodi, Lazarus</hi> come forth: Well, but what ſhall become of the Heathen, who have not this word of Reconciliation? how have they a grace <hi>ſufficient?</hi> It cannot be denied, but they have the <hi>works of God,</hi> ſufficient to convince them, <hi>That God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeek him;</hi> and they have reaſonable Souls, to make ſuch concluſions upon the proſpect of the works of God; and a <hi>Faith in Chriſt as Mediator, is not,</hi> they ſay, neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for thus none could <hi>believe in Chriſt, before he came</hi> (if you will believe them.) <hi>A Faith in God</hi> as a ſupreme being, and as a rewarder of them that ſeek him, being ſufficient; eſpecially, conſidering that Faith is nothing elſe, but <hi>an obedience</hi> to <hi>the commands of Chriſt;</hi>

Now this muſt be underſtood, <hi>ſo far as we</hi> know them, and they are revealed to us. This was the old Doctrine of <hi>Socinus,</hi> and his followers; and in this ſence they ſay, Sufficient grace is given to all, in order to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, becauſe they believe nothing of what we call <hi>grace,</hi> viz. <hi>A particular internal influence and operation of the holy Spirit, begetting in us a lively Faith in Jeſus Chriſt neceſſary to any;</hi> but that every man hath a natural power to do all that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, and may be ſaved if he will but uſe that power, to the uſe of which there needeth not any ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:192227:372"/>of God: But man may be a God to himſelf, a principle of the greateſt good inclining his own heart, to that which is Spiritually good. For that God ſhould give unto any grace, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for his <hi>Salvation,</hi> and yet it ſhould not be effectual, is indeed a contradiction; for it muſt be <hi>ſufficient, and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, If there be ſuch a ſufficient grace granted to all; <hi>It muſt be ſufficient,</hi> either as a Phyſical, or <hi>Natural cauſe,</hi> or as a <hi>Moral cauſe.</hi> Phyſical cauſes, we know act neceſſarily. All that can be pretended, is, <hi>a ſufficiency as a Moral cauſe.</hi> Now certainly in the Goſpel, and the preaching of it, there is only a propoſition of things to be <hi>believed,</hi> and <hi>done,</hi> and arguments uſed to perſwade the <hi>belief or doing of them;</hi> the Queſtion ſtill is, <hi>by what: power it is, that a man doth believe,</hi> and do? What is in the word written, propounded, in the word preached, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, and argued? We ſay it is not of our ſelves, it is the <hi>gift of God;</hi> and it is given to them, <hi>who believe, on the behalf of Chriſt to believe,</hi> Phil. 1.29. Now this means is not given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, the Habits are not infuſed from whence, as from their Roots, and Principles, theſe actions muſt proceed. To this they have nothing to ſay, but that theſe actings flow <hi>from a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in mans will;</hi> yet all men have the ſame reaſonable Souls: thus God <hi>giveth Faith</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> no more to <hi>Paul,</hi> than to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi> The upſhot is therefore: <hi>That there is in man a ſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to his own Salvation,</hi> and need not to be beholden to <hi>Father, Son, or Holy Ghoſt for it;</hi> being once brought forth into the World, and poſſeſſed of a reaſonable Soul, he hath a ſufficiency to his own Slavation, and may be a God unto himſelf: but it is not proper to call this means; we are otherwiſe taught from the Holy Scriptures, and therefore cannot agree it, That all men have an <hi>auxilium ſufficiens;</hi> a ſufficiency of grace, and gracious aſſiſtances in order to their obtaining Eternal life, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Queſt. But the Second Queſtion ſtill remains, viz. <hi>How can God be juſt in the condemnation of any Sinner, to whom he hath not given a ſufficient aid, and aſſiſtance of grace, in order to his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> To this in my former diſcourſes, I have ſpoken ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. But yet I will ſpeak ſomething to it, here falling ſo fully in my way.</p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1. I anſwer firſt. God did give unto <hi>Adam, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:192227:373"/>aids and aſſiſtances of Divine grace to have carried him, and all his poſterity to Heaven.</hi> What was given unto him, was given to him, and his; to him as a publick Perſon, in whom we all were,

This is no better then trifling, and equivocating; ſurely all <hi>habits of grace</hi> ſince the fall, are Supernatural habits, we muſt be taught of God, to <hi>love God,</hi> and to <hi>love one another;</hi> to <hi>fear God,</hi> to <hi>delight,</hi> or to hope in him; had <hi>Adam</hi> therefore no ſuch powers in his ſtate of innocency think we? Further I would gladly know, whether <hi>Adam had not a power in innocency to do whatſoever was neceſſary, in order to the obtaining of everlaſting Salvation?</hi> If God doth not give now to every man ſuch a ſufficiency of power, and Spiritual aſſiſtance; yet, he is juſt in the condemnation of Sinners: Man had ſuch a ſufficiency of power, and loſt it; but God hath not loſt his right to require the exerciſe of it, and to condemn Sinners for ſin, though they now want it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Eſpecially conſidering, that God hath given unto all <hi>ſuch a ſufficiency</hi> of <hi>external means, as is ſufficient</hi> to render them <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe.</hi> This the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1. But you will ſay, <hi>If God hath not given to all a ſufficiency of means, how ſhall man be without excuſe: ſhall not one ſay, Lord! I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of Chriſt,</hi> I never ſaw <hi>thy Law, how ſhould I believe on him of whom I never heard, how ſhould I obey that Law which I never ſaw, nor heard of?</hi> Again, ſhall not another ſay? <hi>Lord, I did indeed hear of a Saviour, the Scripture I read, I beard, but I had no power to believe, I could not chonge my own heart, thou wouldſt not change it; thou indeed, Lord, didſt ſtand at the door of my heart, and knock, but thou didſt never put in thy hand at the hole of the door.</hi> I anſwer, theſe Sinners yet ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, becauſe they walked not up to that light, and mercy, which God gave them. This is what the Apoſtle giveth in plea for God, concerning the Heathen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 21. <hi>The wrath of God, ſaith he, is revealed againſt the ungodlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs of men;</hi> for ſaith he, <hi>That which may be known of God, is manifeſted in them, for God hath ſhewed it to them,</hi> v. 21. <hi>Becauſe when they knew
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:192227:373"/>God, they glorified him not as God,</hi> neither were thankful, but <hi>became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> It is true we ſay, the Heathens have not a light, ſhining amongſt them, they have nothing, but the light of Nature to guide them, and this light maketh no diſcovery of Chriſt: but yet, the light ſhineth with them; a light which will ſhew them there is a God, and diſcover to them, that this God is <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>powerful.</hi> So that (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>they are without excuſe,</hi> becauſe, <hi>that when they knew God, they glorified, him not as God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations;</hi> they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved not what light they had, nor became thankful for it, nor obedient to it. Chriſtians are much more inexcuſable, for beſides that they have an equal ſhare in Natural light, and have the ſame dictates of Natural conſcience with others, there is much more of Chriſt, and his Goſpel manifeſted to them. Chriſt telleth the <hi>Jews, Mat.</hi> 21.32. That <hi>John came unto them in a way of righteouſneſs, and they believed not, but Publicans and Harlots be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him, and you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when you had ſeen it repented not afterwards, that you might believe.</hi> Chriſtians have the preaching of the Goſpel, the <hi>preaching of Faith,</hi> and of <hi>repentance,</hi> and they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not that they might believe;</hi> you will ſay, but it is God that muſt give a power to repent, he gave unto Gentiles, <hi>repentance unto life.</hi> I anſwer, repentance is taken either more largely, or more ſtrictly. More ſtricty it ſignifieth, the turning of the heart from all Sin unto God; this indeed is the work of God, he alone hath an hand upon the heart of man: but more largely it is taken for the turning from ſome ſin, and the performance of external diſcipline: now as to this, the Lord denieth unto none a ſufficiency of grace, and if men do not what in them lyeth, they are without excuſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Finally,</hi> It is moſt certain, that God (whether he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſufficient grace to all, or no, <hi>condemneth none but for ſin.</hi> I have ſhewed you at large, that a <hi>ſinners deſtruction</hi> is of, and from himſelf as the meritorious cauſe. If indeed, God did either condemn any righteous perſon, or were any way obliged to give out effectual grace to all, and did not, this indeed would argue unrighteouſneſs with God; but he doth neither of theſe, his wrath will indeed one day be revealed againſt them, to whom Chriſt and his Goſpel were never revealed, to whom grace ſufficient to bring them to Heaven, and Eternal
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:192227:374" rendition="simple:additions"/>life was never given; but it ſhall never be revealed, but (as the Apoſtle ſaith) againſt the ungodlineſs, and unrighteouſneſs of men: now certainly, God cannot be unrighteous in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing <hi>unrighteouſneſs or ungodlineſs.</hi> If God indeed were a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for his grace to his creature, he might be charged with unrighteouſneſs, if he did not give it out; but he doth not deal out death and deſtruction, but as a wages, nor <hi>Salvation,</hi> and <hi>Eternal life,</hi> but as free gift? Who asketh a reaſon, why <hi>Auguſt Caeſar,</hi> did not beſtow gifts upon all his Courtiers in proportion with thoſe beſtowed on <hi>Maecenas?</hi> We may ſay of God as to all his diſpenſations of grace, <hi>Placuit, hoc ſatis eſt; ubi non aliud jus aut ratio, ipſa voluntas jus &amp; ratio eſt;</hi> that is, It ſo pleaſed God, that is enough; where there is no other right or reaſon, the very will of God is Law, and reaſon enough: Beſides, if the diſtributions of Divine grace were equal, how ſhould God to any ſhew forth the <hi>riches of his Grace?</hi> Let me but acquaint you with a paſſage <hi>of Auguſtine,</hi> upon this Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Doeſt thou ask, (ſaith he) why grace is not given to all according to deſert? I anſwer, becauſe God is merciful: you will ſay, Why is not God merciful to all? I anſwer, (ſaith he) becauſe he is juſt. In this (ſaith he) that grace is given freely, he ſheweth what grace doth, and worketh in thoſe to whom it is given: Let us not therefore be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful to God, that according to the good pleaſure of his will, and for the praiſe of the glory of his grace; he hath delivered us from ſo great a death, whereas if he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver none, yet, he would not be unjuſt.— Let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who is delivered, love grace; let him who is not delivered, acknowledg juſtice; if Divine goodneſs be underſtood in remitting the debt, Juſtice alſo may be underſtood in exacting of it, no way is there any iniquity found with God. But you will ſay then, Why is there in the caſe of Infants, yea, of Twins ſuch a difference? Is it not (ſaith he) the like Queſtion; why in a diverſe cauſe, there is the ſame judgment; and the Workmen in the Vineyard, who wrought the whole day, had but a Penny, as they had who had wrought but one hour? The Caſe was different, the judgment the ſame; they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, what ſaith the Maſter of the Vineyard to them, <hi>Volo.</hi> I will make the laſt like unto the firſt. Thus becauſe bounty was ſhewed to ſome, there was no iniquity toward others,
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:192227:374"/>ſo far as reſpecteth Juſtice, and Grace. As to the guilty perſon that is ſaved, God ſaith, <hi>I will:</hi> As to others he ſaith, Take what is thy own, and go thy way. I will give unto this man, that which I do ow unto him: Is thine eye evil, becauſe mine is good? If he ſhall ſay, and why not unto me? Here he ſhall hear, <hi>Who art thou, who diſputeſt with God?</hi> Whom thou findeſt as to one man a bountiful gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as to another, a juſt exactor, as to none at all, unjuſt; for whereas he ſhould be juſt, if he ſhould puniſh both; he that is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, hath indeed reaſon to give thanks; he that is damned, hath no cauſe to find fault.</q>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> This diſcourſe calleth once more aloud unto all, <hi>To walk up to the light which they have.</hi> Though we deny, that God giveth unto all, yea, that he giveth to any (unleſs ſuch as are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained unto life) a ſufficiency of grace, and gracious aſſiſtances in order to their eternal Salvation; yet we ſay, God granteth to all, though in very different degrees, ſome means. The very Heathens have ſomething of God manifeſted to them, and manifeſted in them: <hi>For the inviſible things of God,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by the things that are made, even his eternal power, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head:</hi> they have <hi>natural light,</hi> and a <hi>natural reaſon,</hi> and ſomething of a natural conſcience too. The works of <hi>Creation they have,</hi> and the <hi>works of Providence,</hi> ſhewing them a great deal of the eternal power and God-head of God; ſufficient to convince them that there is <hi>a God,</hi> a <hi>Great, Infinite, Powerful God;</hi> for he leaveth not <hi>men without witneſs,</hi> giving the very Heathens <hi>fruitful times and ſeaſons.</hi> But I am not ſpeaking unto Heathens, you that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have yet further means, though in different degrees too. All have the Scriptures, Proteſtants have them in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſo as they may read, and in a great meaſure underſtand what they read; all have the Miniſtry of the Word, they have the Goſpel preached to them; though it is true, that alſo is in very
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:192227:376"/>different degrees; yet all have ſomething of what they call a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seaſon, and are perſwaded, and intreated to turn unto God. This we ſay, is not a <hi>ſufficient means</hi> to bring a Soul unto Heaven: if God doth not more for Souls, than let them have the benefit of the works of Creation, ſhewing them his glory, and the benefit of the light of Nature and Reaſon, and the works of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Providence; yea, and of the Scriptures, and the preaching of them; and that not only in a cold, flat, and dead, and dull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but in the moſt lively, powerful manner; they will never <hi>repent,</hi> never <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>turn unto God: Paul may plant,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> may water long enough, if God doth not give the increaſe. It is not in him that Preacheth, and perſwadeth, nor in him that Prayeth, and heareth, but in God that ſheweth mercy; he muſt give both <hi>to will,</hi> and <hi>to do;</hi> he muſt give repentance unto life, and be both the <hi>Author,</hi> and the <hi>finiſher of our Faith.</hi> But yet I ſay, all theſe are means, ſome of them very great and excellent means; and the higheſt in the order of external means: And though they be not ſufficient, though uſed with the beſt natural improvements of our own will, and power, to bring us to Heaven; yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to render us without excuſe unto God, if we do not make a due, and juſt improvement of them. Let me therefore plead with you, that you would live up to the means of grace which God giveth you. That ſort of people amongſt us, whom we call <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> call to men to <hi>Hearken to the light within them:</hi> I do not well underſtand what they mean by the <hi>light within us;</hi> but thus much is certain, that all men have <hi>a light within them,</hi> and <hi>they have a light without them.</hi> The light without them is the <hi>light of the works of God in Nature,</hi> and <hi>of his works of Providence; The Scriptures, and the Miniſtry of the Word:</hi> all men have ſome, or other, or all of theſe. All men have alſo a light <hi>within them,</hi> the <hi>light of Nature,</hi> and of <hi>Reaſon:</hi> This light (as I have ſhewed you) is not ſufficient to ſhew a man the way to Heaven, but it is enough to ſhew a man <hi>much of God,</hi> and much of his duty; and the way to obtain a full and ſufficient light, to bring him to glory, is for him to walk up to the light which he hath: This will be <hi>the condemnation, that when light is come into the world, men love darkneſs more than light, becauſe their hearts, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> But to ſhut up this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> In the laſt place, What an obligation doth this lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the children of God, to cry out with holy <hi>David, Bleſs the
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:192227:377"/>Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me, bleſs his holy name. Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and ſing of all his benefits, who forgiveth all thine iniquity, and healeth all thy diſeaſes. Who redeemeth thy life from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and crowneth thee with lovingkindneſs, and tender mercy.</hi> To heighten your ſouls apprehenſions of the Divine goodneſs exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to you, and raiſe up your hearts in the high praiſes of God, I ſhall but offer Two things to your Meditation, with which I ſhall ſhut up this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider, <hi>What is done unto you.</hi> God hath undoubtedly given unto you <hi>a ſufficient grace:</hi> The ſufficiency loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to you by the Lords giving Chriſt to you; <hi>I can do all things,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> So that God may ſay to you, (as to his Vineyard, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. <hi>What could I have done more for my Vineyard, than I have done?)</hi> What could I have done more for ſuch a ſoul, than I have done? God hath diſplay'd the riches of his grace upon your ſouls. God could do no more for you than he hath done. God hath nothing more to give, than grace and glory; he hath given you <hi>grace,</hi> ſpecial, <hi>diſtinguiſhing grace:</hi> Glory is hereafter to be revealed, in the mean time ſpecial effectual grace is glory begun.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, Secondly, <hi>Why to you?</hi> to you rather than unto others; others may eaſily underſtand, <hi>Why not to them?</hi> becauſe they deſpiſed the riches of his Grace, they ſinned againſt their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light, they lived not up to their light of Revelation. But <hi>Why to you?</hi> Did not you alſo ſin againſt your light? Did you make that improvement of the works of God, the light of your natural Reaſon, or Conſcience that you ought to have done? If not, Why hath God done more for you, than for them; diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered more of Chriſt unto you, than unto them? Here you will be loſt, and at laſt be forced to reſolve it into this; God hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me mercy, becauſe he would ſhew me mercy, and hath exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded compaſſion to me, only becauſe he would extend compaſſion. Oh ſit down alone ſometimes, and ſay, <hi>My ſoul,</hi> Why ſhould the God of grace ſhew mercy unto thee? Haſt thou not ſinned often againſt the very light of Nature, and Reaſon? Haſt thou not <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and trampled under foot the blood of the Son of God? What high praiſes of God, are high enough for every true believers heart? How <hi>precious ſhould Chriſt be unto his ſoul?</hi> How can he ever have thoughts of God high enough, or with his tongue ſing the praiſes of God loud enough?
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:192227:377"/>How doth he ſtand concerned to cry out with <hi>David, Awake my glory?</hi> Oh! What manner of perſon ſhould a believer be in <hi>all bolineſs of converſation?</hi> He can certainly never do enough for that God, who hath done ſo much for him, and hath made ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt him, and others: This is praiſing of God, not in word and in tongue only, but indeed, and in truth: Oh this is to <hi>perfect holineſs!</hi> It is for that God who hath from eternity cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you to obtain everlaſting life, and hath left others to periſh in their iniquity; for that God who in the diſpenſations of his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Providence, in the execution of that purpoſe, hath given his Son for you, to purchaſe a certainty of Salvation for your Souls: who hath ſent the Miniſters of his Goſpel to you, publiſhing this Salvation by Chriſt, when others never heard of the Goſpel; nay, who hath done much more than this, when others ſate under the Goſpel, and their hearts were never wrought upon by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; God hath eſpecially changed, and wrought upon your hearts, and conquered your ſouls into the obedience of his Goſpel. I ſhall conclude with that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.1, 2. <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever. Let the redeemed of the Lord ſay ſo, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy.</hi>

                  <p>I Have (as you know) in this Diſcourſe, formerly made uſe of this Text to found a Propoſition upon, concerning the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchableneſs of the ways of Divine Providence,</hi> (for of thoſe ways it is, that this Text ſpeaketh) <hi>I beheld,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Eccl. 8.17.) <hi>all the words of God, that a man cannot find out the ways of God which are done under the Sun, yea, though a
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:192227:378"/>man labour to find it out, yet be ſhall not find it, yea, though a wiſe man think to know it, yet he ſhall not find it.</hi> I have ſhewed you that the ways of Divine Providence cannot be found out, 1. <hi>As to the Compaſs and Latitude of them.</hi> 2. <hi>As to the Tendencies of them.</hi> 3. <hi>As to the Method and Tract of them.</hi> 4. <hi>As to the Indication of them.</hi> 5. Laſtly, <hi>As to the Reaſon of them.</hi> This is as true, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the motions of <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>effectual grace,</hi> as to the <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Providence,</hi> in its more ordinary and common motions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the affairs of the World. Now one of the Reaſons why the ways of the Lord cannot be found out, is becauſe he doth not always tread the ſame ſteps. God doth not always do the ſame work in the ſame method: and this is true as to the motions of Providence, in the diſtribution of <hi>ſpecial grace,</hi> as well as with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to its <hi>motions,</hi> reſpecting the affairs of this life. I ſhall not pretend to find out theſe depths, I ſhall only Diſcourſe ſome of theſe diſtributions, ſo far as to ſhew you, that they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable motions. I ſhall firſt Diſcourſe ſhortly <hi>concerning the works of Divine Providence, in the bringing home of Souls unto himſelf,</hi> in the work of <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>In Gods carrying on of his work in the ſouls of his Saints,</hi> thereby preparing, and <hi>making them meet for the Inheritance of light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which I intend at this time to ſpeak to, is the variety of Gods ways <hi>in bringing home ſouls to himſelf:</hi> Even there the way of God is like the way of an <hi>Eagle</hi> in the Air, a <hi>Serpent</hi> on a Rock, and a <hi>Ship</hi> on the Sea, which can none of them be trackt, nor found out in the methods of their motions. <hi>God in the Converting of ſouls unto himſelf, doth not keep an uniform motion,</hi> nor tread certain ſteps; but ſometimes he worketh one way, ſometimes another; ſometimes by one means, ſometimes by another. For ſome order in this Diſcourſe, I ſhall Diſcourſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Concerning the varieties of Divine Providence in the Converſion of ſouls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>What reaſonable account may be given of that variety of Gods motions in this thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>What practical concluſions may be drawn from hence, or inferred upon this Diſcourſe.</hi> I begin with the firſt of theſe.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What varieties of Divine Providence are obſervable in this great work of changing hearts, and the Converſion of ſouls unto God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth is, there are ſome that will underſtand none at all;
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:192227:378"/>poor ſouls, they will underſtand no other <hi>Converſion,</hi> nor <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> but in <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> every one that is <hi>Baptized,</hi> is <hi>Regenerated.</hi> There was indeed ſuch a thing as Converſion, when the world was all <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens;</hi> and to be brought to imbrace the Doctrine of the Goſpel: But for any ſuch thing, as the <hi>turning the heart from ſin unto God,</hi> this they underſtood not; and indeed by their lives, one would judg they did not. But I am ſpeaking to thoſe, whom I believe taught better things, and who believe other things; ſurely <hi>converſion,</hi> or <hi>turning from Idols,</hi> and <hi>erronious Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> is not all that we read in Scripture of <hi>the change of the heart,</hi> and <hi>turning unto God:</hi> But in the <hi>Converting of ſinners,</hi> you ſhall obſerve a great variety, chiefly remarkable in Three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As to the time, the particular time of mans life, when God is pleaſed to call home ſouls unto himſelf;</hi> ſome in their youth, ſome in their age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As to the External means, which God maketh uſe of in this work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>As to the manner of Gods dealing with ſouls, in the Converting, Regenerating, and bringing home ſouls unto himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>As to the time.</hi> This our bleſſed Lord excellently ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out to us in that Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. Where he telleth us: <hi>That the Kingdom of heaven is like unto an houſholder, who went out early to find out labourers, whom he might ſend into his Vineyard;</hi> ſome he called <hi>early</hi> in the morning, ſome about the <hi>ſixth hour,</hi> ſome about the <hi>ninth hour,</hi> ſome at the <hi>eleventh hour;</hi> he called them in at ſeveral hours. The Kingdom of God is the <hi>Church of God,</hi> which properly conſiſteth only of ſuch as are <hi>Saints</hi> by <hi>effectual-calling;</hi> though others that are <hi>viſibly and profeſſionally</hi> ſuch, have that denomination, being mixed with others, who are the true members of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Gods calling men into his Vineyard, is his adding <hi>to the number of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Now God calleth ſome early in their youth, ſome in their middle-age, ſome (but very few) in their old age; ſome even at their dying hour, though of them there be, of all, the rareſt examples. As God had <hi>Nazarites</hi> from the womb, ſo he ſanctifieth ſome from the womb; <hi>Samuel</hi> was from the very womb Dedicated to God, and accepted of God. God telleth <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 1.5. That <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came out of the womb, he ſanctified him.</hi> I am a-ware, that <hi>Sanctifying</hi> in that Text may be taken in another ſenſe, as it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a <hi>Separation to the Office of a Prophet;</hi> and ſo it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:192227:379"/>to be interpreted by the following words; and <hi>ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee to be a Prophet:</hi> but why it ſhould be limited to that ſenſe, I do not underſtand. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was ſeparated from his Mothers womb, and called by his grace:</hi> but there <hi>ſeparating</hi> muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Gods deſign and purpoſe, for we know <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>blaſphemer,</hi> a <hi>perſecutor.</hi> But certain it is, that God calleth ſome very young; <hi>Timothy, from a child, was acquainted with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Joſiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 34.1, 2. <hi>at eight years old began to reign,</hi> and ver. 2. <hi>did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord;</hi> and ver. 3. at ſixteen years of age he ſet upon his <hi>famous reformation.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Abijam,</hi> the young Son of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that he only of the houſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> went to his grave in peace, <hi>becauſe there was ſome good thing found in him.</hi> Sometimes, and moſt ordinarily, God worketh upon peoples hearts in their riper ſtate, of which are the moſt plentiful inſtances in Scripture. You read of the <hi>thief upon the Croſs, converted in the laſt day of his life:</hi> and what we find in Scripture, we find God ſtill doing in the diſpenſations of his Providence. The age in which we have lived, hath afforded ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances of <hi>children,</hi> whoſe hearts we may charitably judg, from the accounts we have had of them, God had in their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry childhood Regenerated, and Sanctified them. Bleſſed be God, we are not without ſome inſtances of perſons, and thoſe not a few, whom God hath wrought upon in their more adult eſtate, and ſome alſo in their old age; though Examples of that ſtill are, and ever were very rare. This is the firſt variety, obvious to every Eye.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond variety obſervable, is in the means which <hi>God is pleaſed to make uſe of:</hi> For theſe God never <hi>tied himſelf to the ſame means.</hi> The preaching of the Goſpel, was always made uſe of by God, as the moſt ordinary means: It was, at the <hi>preaching</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>Three Thouſand Souls</hi> were in one day converted; and the Apoſtle telleth us, that it pleaſed God by the <hi>fooliſhneſs of Preaching to ſave them that believed,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. And the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>faith cometh by hearing,</hi> and <hi>hearing by the word of God.</hi> But yet, God hath made uſe (though more rarely) of other <hi>means:</hi> the means which God firſt uſed to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> ſeems to be his <hi>reading</hi> in <hi>the Prophet Iſaiah.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God made uſe of <hi>Providences:</hi> you read of many convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and induced to believe in Chriſt, upon the account of his <hi>Miracles;</hi> and ſtill God is pleaſed to uſe the ſame variety of means.
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:192227:379"/>Generally indeed, God maketh uſe of the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; ſometimes he ſanctifieth the reading of the word; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he maketh uſe of Providences. I think, I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times read concerning <hi>Waldus,</hi> the Father of thoſe ancient <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> called the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> that the ſeeing of one of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions ſuddenly drop down dead, was the firſt means of his converſion; we read of a <hi>great dread</hi> that fell upon People, upon the ſudden death of <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphirah.</hi> My ſelf have known one that would acknowledg, that his hearing of <hi>Bells</hi> Ring for perſons dead, was a great means to beget ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts in him, Firſt, of turning unto God. It pleaſed God to make uſe of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> his Chains, to turn his heart; and the impriſonment of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 16. to convert the Goa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and his whole Family. Sometimes God uſeth the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Parents; ſometimes one means, ſometimes another, as it pleaſeth him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third obſervable variety, reſpecteth, <hi>The manner of Gods working upon Souls.</hi> It is true, in ſome (eſpecially two) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects God dealeth a-like withal.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He forceth no Soul,</hi> he indeed maketh <hi>it willing,</hi> and giveth <hi>to will;</hi> but the Soul in its converſion to God, moveth willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and freely.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, He putteth forth an <hi>Almighty power, as to every Soul that is converted.</hi> The Soul is <hi>made willing,</hi> but it is <hi>in the day of the Lords power,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. But yet the effects of this power are not always the ſame; all are not drawn in the like manner, ſome are drawn by a <hi>Silken Thred;</hi> others by <hi>Iron-Fetters:</hi> ſome God works upon in a more rough way, ſome in a more ſoft, and gentle way. Some are a little, or not at all under the <hi>Spirit of bondage:</hi> others are <hi>Months,</hi> and <hi>Years</hi> under it; they are filled with the Lords terrors, and cry unto him <hi>out of the belly of Hell,</hi> before he heareth them: ſome are drawn with the Cords of love only, others with the Chains of fears. Some are as it were inſenſibly drawn, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God as it were, ſlippeth into their Souls without any noiſe; they become Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, and there is neither the noiſe of Ax, nor Hammer heard about the Spiritual building; others are terrified like the <hi>Jaylor, Acts</hi> 16. caſt down to the Earth like <hi>Paul,</hi> both in order to converſion, and their reception of <hi>converting Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="668" facs="tcp:192227:380"/>2. Secondly, You ſhall obſerve, <hi>That God</hi> ſometimes <hi>makes his way to the heart by the head, ſometimes,</hi> he begins at <hi>the heart, and by that maketh his way to the head:</hi> my meaning is, ſometimes God begins his work upon knowing perſons, who have been <hi>Catechiſed out of the Law,</hi> and from Children have <hi>had a knowledg of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> ſanctifying their firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to them, and reflecting upon their Hearts and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the notions of truth, which they have been bred up in, the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> bringing to their <hi>remembrance,</hi> what of God they have formerly heard from Miniſters, Parents, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. As to others, God maketh his way <hi>from the heart, to the head.</hi> They have great degrees of ignorance, as to the truths of God; but God bleſſeth his word ſo far, as that they can apprehend, they are in a loſt condition, and muſt look for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther righteouſneſs beſides their own, and take up a new courſe of life; they hear of a Saviour come into the World, of a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in him, and a readineſs to ſave unto the utmoſt, thoſe who by faith come unto him: this makes them to <hi>inquire, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and come,</hi> to ſeek for Spiritual knowledg <hi>as for Silver,</hi> and <hi>to dig for it, as for hidden treaſure,</hi> and by <hi>following on to know the Lord,</hi> they came to know him. But this is enough to have hinted you, as to the varieties to be obſerved in Gods methods, of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the converſion of Souls. Let me in the next place ſhew the reaſonableneſs of the Divine workings in this great work.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And firſt as to the <hi>variety obſerved in point of time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some are converted young. Poſſibly God may do it, <hi>that he may Crown the indeavours of Parents, &amp; Governours, and thereby engage others to take care of the Souls of their Correlations committed to their charge.</hi> Some Parents are very ſolicitous for the Spiritual good of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whetting upon them their loſt condition by Nature, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten minding them of Eternity, and calling upon them, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Creator in the days of their youth; now where any will do this, God takes notice of it, and will often Crown thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick labours with a deſired ſucceſs; for the encouragement of others, God gives in to their prayers, the Souls of their Children oft-times, while yet they are Children. It is ſaid of <hi>Monica,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that ſhe was a woman of <hi>many</hi> tears, and prayers for her Son; and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was wont to comfort her, telling her <hi>that it was impoſſible, that a Child of ſo many tears ſhould periſh.</hi> It is not impoſſible indeed that ſome ſhould periſh, who have
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:192227:380"/>been Children of many tears, and prayers, for whom <hi>godly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> have travailed in pain again, till Chriſt ſhould be formed in them: there is no merit in our prayers, and tears, neither hath God made us any promiſe, that he will convert, and Eternally ſave all our Children, on whoſe behalf we labour and wreſtle with God; but as <hi>Hannah</hi> obtained <hi>her Child by Prayer,</hi> upon which account it was, that ſhe named him <hi>Samuel, Beg'd of God;</hi> ſo I doubt not but that there are many good Parents, that by <hi>Prayer</hi> have from God obtained the <hi>Converſion, and Regeneration</hi> of their Children; and that <hi>early,</hi> that the Lord might as it were ſhew them, that he gave in the Souls of their Children to their prayers, and their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructions, exhortations, reproofs, catechizing, &amp;c. If we ſhould never ſee grace appearing in tender years, we ſhould conclude it in vain, during thoſe years, to uſe any means with them, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch an end. The Apoſtle telleth <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That from a Child he had known the Scriptures;</hi> and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. He mentioneth <hi>an unfained faith that</hi> was both in his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Lois,</hi> and in his <hi>Mother Eunice,</hi> and he was <hi>perſwaded in him alſo,</hi> in him (doubtleſs in great meaſure by their means.) God honouring their labours with the converſion of <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Poſſibly God doth intend ſome elect veſſels of his no long time in the World.</hi> God intended <hi>Abijam</hi> the Son <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> but a ſhort time in the World, and therefore there was early found in him ſome good thing. I obſerved that amongſt all the Patriarchs, which are reckoned up, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. He of them who (before <hi>Enos</hi>) lived the ſhorteſt time, lived 895 years, the reſt lived longer, only <hi>Enoch</hi> lived but 365, about a third part of the time of the other. It is ſaid, <hi>He walked with God, and was not, for God took-him;</hi> and we ſee this of times in our experience, God taketh away thoſe in their youth, whom he calleth in their Childhood and youth. You have an obſervation, that <hi>beautiful Children,</hi> or Children of <hi>compoſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious countenances,</hi> (when very young) or ſuch as being very young are very toward, and fond of their Books, ſeldome live long; how true that is I cannot ſay, but you ſhall (I believe) more certainly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it of ſuch who earlily have their hearts changed, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto God. God ſetteth thoſe to work young, to whom he hath not appointed long time to work; of all whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto Chriſt, he muſt loſe none; and though Infants elect, are ſaved upon the Covenant of grace, before it appeareth to the World, that they have laid hold upon it, or are in a capacity in order
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:192227:381" rendition="simple:additions"/>to it, to exerciſe their reaſon; yet, that is not Gods uſual way: where he alloweth to any a longer life, till they come to exerciſe their reaſon, he expecteth they ſhould keep the ordinary road to Heaven, by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith, and in order to this he worketh upon their hearts betimes, giving them repentance unto life, and faith to lay hold upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Poſſibly God doth intend ſome a longer time in the World, but hath deſigned them for ſome great and eminent ſervice in it;</hi> ſuch the Lord uſeth to call betimes. I will ſhew it you in two or three eminent inſtances. The firſt is that of <hi>Samuel. Samuel</hi> was to be a <hi>great Prophet,</hi> yea, and a <hi>Judge in Iſrael;</hi> God accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times took him unto his more ſpecial tutorage: he was deſigned by his Mother, and from the very time of his <hi>weaning, by her</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated unto the Lord; and the Lord while he was yet a Child, eminently communicated his mind to him; as you read in the ſtory, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3. chap. <hi>Joſiah</hi> was a Second. God had deſigned him for a great and eminent ſervice, he was Propheſied of many years before he was born, and that by name, as who ſhould work a great and eminent Reformation, and he did do that. God earlily prepares him for it, he was but 8 years old when he began to reign, and he began to ſeek the Lord God of his Fathers; and when was but 16 years of age, he began a work of Reformation, of a long and moſt groſly corrupted ſtate. <hi>Timothy</hi> is a third. God had deſigned him for an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> to have a great hand in ſettling the Goſpel-Church. God called him very young, <hi>from a Child he knew the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make the man of God wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> To theſe I may add an inſtance of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Prince in our own Nation. King <hi>Edward the Sixth,</hi> who laid the firſt Principles of our reformation; (King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. did little, and what he did ſeemed rather to be out of intereſt ſo biaſſing him, than otherwiſe) God was pleaſed in his very young and tender years, to ſeize upon his heart. He had intended him (as the event proved) but a ſhort life, and he had laid out for him a very great work, to purge ſuch an <hi>Augean</hi> Stable, as the Popiſh rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble had left. Two obſervations I have made upon reading the Scripture. 1. <hi>That when God had long kept ſome women his ſervants bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, they ordinarily proved the Mothers of very eminent Children. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, Manoahs wife, Hanna,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> are inſtances of that. 2. That <hi>God very often when he deſigned Perſons for ſome eminent work, prepared them for it, by an early ſeizing upon their hearts,</hi> and ſanctifying them from the Womb unto himſelf. And this will
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:192227:381"/>appear to you very reaſonable upon a double account.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Thoſe which do a great deal of work for God, muſt have a great deal of time to do it in.</hi> All humane actions you know require time, and a proportion of time according to the work.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Thoſe who are to excel in work muſt not be much blotted in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious converſation. Jacob</hi> in his bleſſing of <hi>Reuben, Gen.</hi> 49. v. 4. hath this expreſſion, <hi>Reuben ſhall not excel, becauſe he went up unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bed, he went up unto my Couch.</hi> God ſeldome alloweth any one eminently to excel, whoſe youth hath been ſtained with many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and notorious blots; they may come to Heaven upon their converſion, but they ſhall not <hi>excel in the world.</hi> I can think but of one inſtance in Scripture to the contrary, which is that of <hi>Saul,</hi> he was a <hi>perſecutor</hi> (himſelf telleth us) and a <hi>blaſphemer,</hi> yet <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to mercy;</hi> but he ſaith, it was becauſe <hi>he did it ignorantly.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>perſecution</hi> was not rooted in a malice againſt godlineſs, and holineſs, but in an <hi>error of judgment:</hi> he ſaith of himſelf, that <hi>he verily thought, that he ought to do many things againſt Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.</hi> There is a great deal of difference betwixt ſcandalous ſinners: one man <hi>is prophane, and a perſecutor only by a miſtake,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man is ſo <hi>by principle.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of the former ſort: 'tis true, he was a prophane, and miſchievous perſecutor, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane blaſphemer; but it was <hi>by a miſtake,</hi> not that he had any prejudice, or ill Opinion of the <hi>ways of holineſs,</hi> which Chriſts Doctrine led to; for he was never, that we read of, <hi>ſcandalous</hi> in thoſe things which <hi>the light of Nature, Reaſon,</hi> or the <hi>Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> required, or forbad; but only as to the <hi>matters of the Goſpel,</hi> which his Country-men did not own, eſpecially thoſe who had Educated him; for after <hi>the ſtricteſt Sect of Religion amongſt the Jews,</hi> he liv'd a <hi>Phariſee;</hi> ſo that his <hi>ſcandalous</hi> actions were bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed only upon a miſtake. But others now are <hi>prophane by a principle:</hi> What <hi>principle?</hi> not a principle of error in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, not rightly conceiving of the truths of God: But a principle of <hi>malice and hatred in the will and affections, to any thing which croſſeth their luſts;</hi> they hate the image of God where-ever they ſee it; they would have the <hi>ſtrait-gate</hi> wide enough for <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, Adulterers, Sabbath-breakers, Lyers,</hi> all ſorts of ſinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very light of Nature and Reaſon, and the moſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Texts of Scriptures, to enter in, and perſecute all thoſe who oppoſe them in this thing; (a ſin under the Goſpel very near to, if not the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt) you never read of one of theſe converted. Now theſe and ſuch-like other prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:192227:382"/>are not only <hi>ſcandalous</hi> in the Eyes of Gods people, but in the <hi>Eyes of the men of the world:</hi> and although God ſometimes changeth the hearts of debauched, and prophane perſons, (though ſeldom the hearts of perſecutors from this principle) yet he rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffers them to excel, or to be in any eminent ſtation, or of any remarkable note in his Church: when-as therefore he deſigneth any ſoul to any eminent ſtation, or place in his Church, or to do him any eminent ſervice in any civil ſtate, the Providence of God ordinarily ſeizeth upon their hearts in their youth, and keepeth them from thoſe debaucheries in their life, as may expoſe them to the <hi>obloquie</hi> of the world; and make them ſay, <hi>Is Saul alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Prophets?</hi> For a former prophane, and notoriouſly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous life, would much hinder that reputation of theirs in the eye of the world; which is neceſſary in a rational way, to make what they ſhall afterwards ſay, and do for God, acceptable unto the world. Hence it is that you ſhall obſerve, that <hi>Miniſters,</hi> if they be leud in their lives, ſeldom or never do any good in their places, <hi>Ducimur praeceptis, trahimur exemplis;</hi> they are reaſonably judged but to act a part, who call men to holineſs, and live unholily themſelves: every one is ready to ſay to them, <hi>Phyſician, heal thy ſelf,</hi> and to ſay within themſelves, If theſe men did in very deed believe what they talk to us, they would not themſelves live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what they teach: And although a converted ſoul (who hath formerly been prophane) doth not ſo, yet his former life is a wound upon his honour and reputation, which is of great concern to thoſe, to whom he preacheth. God therefore ordinarily where he deſigneth a perſon for an eminent ſtation, or work, doth prepare him for it, ſeizing him when young for himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, God calleth ſome in their old age, at their very laſt hour; <hi>That there may be no room left for any ſoul to deſpair of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace.</hi> It was <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Obſervation of old, <hi>He called one, that none might deſpair, and but one, that none might preſume.</hi> God calleth men into his Vineyard, ſome of them at the <hi>eleventh hour,</hi> that the oldeſt ſinners might have hope; that the moſt decrepit ſinner might not ſay, <hi>I am a dry tree,</hi> it is too late for me to think of repenting, and turning unto God: yea, indeed God may be conceived for this reaſon, to call ſome at all hours; ſome at the <hi>ſixth,</hi> ſome at the <hi>nineth,</hi> ſome at the <hi>eleventh hour;</hi> that ſinners in all the periods of their lives might have hope, and ſome grounds of incouragement to turn unto God, when they ſee, that at all
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:192227:382"/>hours, ſome have been converted, and turned unto God, and have found favour with him. But this is enough to have ſpoken, to have ſhewn you the reaſon of the variety which the Providence of God ſhews us, as to this his firſt work, of converſion and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home ſouls with reſpect to time. Let us now a little conſider the reaſonableneſs of the <hi>Providence of God,</hi> making uſe of a variety of External means; moſt ordinarily (I told you) he maketh uſe of the <hi>publick preaching of the Goſpel.</hi> Thus you read of moſt in Scripture converted, ſometimes of the private inſtruction of friends: Thus when <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi>'s preaching, had been bleſſed to ſend Two of his Diſciples unto Chriſt; <hi>Andrew</hi> being one, he brings <hi>Peter</hi> his Brother; and when Chriſt had found <hi>Philip, Philip</hi> was an inſtrument to bring <hi>Nathaniel;</hi> and the woman of <hi>Samaria, Joh.</hi> 5. was an inſtrument to commend Chriſt to thoſe of her City, though indeed, when they came to hear and ſee Chriſt, they told her, That now they believed, not ſo much for what ſhe had told them, as for what themſelves had <hi>heard,</hi> and <hi>ſeen;</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God maketh uſe of other Providences, as I have more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed you in my former Diſcourſe. Now this is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God <hi>may honour his own Ordinances.</hi> He hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>fooliſhneſs of preaching for the ſalvation of the Elect.</hi> He hath ſaid, <hi>Hear, and your ſouls ſhall live.</hi> He hath told us, that <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God:</hi> and hath told us, <hi>How ſhall they believe, on him of whom they have not heard, and how ſhall they hear, without a preacher, or preach except they be ſent?</hi> It is but reaſonable therefore, that God having ſet up ſuch an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as <hi>Preaching,</hi> and eſtabliſhed ſuch an order of Officers in his Church, as that of <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> ſhould in the ordinary, and moſt uſual courſe of his Providence, concur with it, and bleſs it, and the labours of thoſe, who are employ'd in it, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and bringing home of ſouls: He hath ſaid of old, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I record my name to dwel,</hi> there I will <hi>meet my people and bleſs them.</hi> Gods name is ſtamped upon the Ordinance <hi>of Preaching;</hi> he hath Commiſſionated his Miniſters, to <hi>go, Preach, and Baptize;</hi> he hath told them, that <hi>he will be with them to the end of the world.</hi> God muſt honour his own Inſtitution, and give a being to his own word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet ſecondly, It is alſo reaſonable that we ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, <hi>That God is not tyed up to any means,</hi> and know, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:192227:383"/>is Gods work, not a Miniſters; Paul may plant,</hi> and <hi>Apollos may water,</hi> but <hi>God muſt give the increaſe:</hi> now this would not be underſtood, if God never uſed any other means than the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miniſters to convert ſouls. God will therefore ſometimes work immediately, ſometimes by different means; <hi>Reading the word;</hi> (as in the caſe of the <hi>Eunuch</hi>) the <hi>counſels, reproofs,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations</hi> of others, as in the caſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel: Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Manaſſes: Miracles,</hi> as in the caſe of many, of whom you read in the Goſpel, that they were converted; to let us ſee, that God, although he uſeth means, yet is not limited to them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, God may be conceived to uſe the means of <hi>private inſtructions, and counſels for the incouragement of all perſons, ſet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to others, to a faithful performance of their duties, and a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, and for ſouls committed to their truſts.</hi> It diſcourageth all ſorts of labours, when we ſee nothing of that fruit from it, which we expected, or intended. But of this, I have ſpoke before.</p>
                  <p>Further yet, to ſhew you the <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> of the variety of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the manner of converting, and bringing home of ſouls unto himſelf, I noted it to you in Two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God ſometimes makes his way by the head, to the heart; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the heart, to the head.</hi> This appears exceeding reaſonable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That God may commend knowledg of ſpiritual things to us, and</hi> (as I ſaid before) <hi>encourage duty.</hi> We are perſons whoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are pittifully imperfect in the things of God, and are very prone to take up falſe notions and meaſures; and becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux and operation of the Spirit of God, is by all men (of ſound judgment in the things of God) determined neceſſary to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we are apt to think that we have nothing to do with our children, and ſervants, but only to wait until God ſhall <hi>move the waters,</hi> (I mean change their hearts) and all Inſtruction and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing is needleſs; and that bringing up youth to a knowledg of the form of ſound words, is only to learn them to be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God therefore to ſhew us the advantage of ſpiritual knowledg, and to mind us of, and encourage us to our ſpiritual duty, is pleaſed ſometimes to make his way to the head, by the heart; reflecting the notions of truth, which have been inſtilled into us while we are young upon our conſciences, making that knowledg inſtrumental to our converſion, and eternal Salvation; and ſo letting the governours of others know, that they have not laboured in vain with the ſouls committed to their charge.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="675" facs="tcp:192227:383"/>2. On the other ſide, God ſometimes <hi>making his way by the heart to the head,</hi> making impreſſions upon the hearts of ſome poor blind ignorant Souls, and ſetting them on work <hi>to inquire after Salvation; lets us know that the converſion of a Sinner is a work of grace, and divine power,</hi> not a meer <hi>rational effect</hi> of notions imprinted upon the underſtanding, nor of <hi>moral Suaſion,</hi> (alas theſe poor creatures poſſibly are not fit objects for ſuch a thing;) but the finger of God is in it, who hath the hearts of all men in his hand, and turneth them as it pleaſeth him: thus by this variety of his Providence, he doth both <hi>honour his own ordinance,</hi> and ſhew the profit, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of means, and alſo the mighty power that is put forth, in the changing of the heart by effectual grace, both which it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the World ſhould be convinced of. And this is enough for a reaſonable account of the ſecond variety.</p>
                  <p>The laſt variety which I obſerved, was <hi>Gods keeping ſome Souls a longer time under the Spirit of bondage than others.</hi> Some he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to draw to himſelf more <hi>ſweetly,</hi> rather by <hi>arguments of love,</hi> than <hi>terrors and arguments</hi> of wrath; others he is pleaſed more to fill <hi>with terrors,</hi> yea, and to keep their Souls a long time under them: and this we find by experience, is oftimes matter of ſome trouble to others, whom God hath dealt more gently with; they begin to doubt and ſuſpect whether God hath wrought any real change in them, becauſe they have not been in the <hi>belly of Hell,</hi> as others have been: now there may be a reaſonable account alſo given of this difference, though we muſt not pretend to find out the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Divine counſels in this diſpenſation of his Providence.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay little of the <hi>difference of Natural complexions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,</hi> which is not inconſiderable in this caſe. He is little read in men and women in the World, who doth not obſerve, that as in the earth, (of which man is made) there is a great difference of Soil, that one Soil doth more eaſily ſuck up a ſhowre of Rain, and digeſt it, than others. So in man there are ſome complexions that are far more tenacious of <hi>grief,</hi> and impreſſive by fear, than others are; (ſuch are chiefly <hi>Melancholick,</hi> and ſome <hi>Flegmatick complextons.</hi>) Now it is true, God in his work of converſion, could cure this, but he ordinarily doth not work miraculouſly; and where God begins a work upon the Souls of any who have bodies, which they inform of theſe ſad, and dark conſtitutions, it is not at all to be wondered, (they being Naturally more prone to fears, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, to doubts and ſuſpicions, and more tenacious of grief, and ſorrow,) if by the working, the Natural working of theſe
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:192227:384"/>paſſions, to which their Natural complexion, and conſtitution, more fully ſubjecteth them, if they be longer <hi>under the Spirit of bondage, than others.</hi> You will ſee at the ſame caſe with them in other things exciting thoſe paſſions, and unleſs you would ſuppoſe, that God in the converſion of ſuch, ſhould work miraculouſly, and alter their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural complexion, and conſtitution, it is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe that it ſhould be otherwiſe, it is but according to the natural work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Spirits, who can get off no occaſions of ſorrow and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo ſoon as others can, who are of more airy, &amp; chearly conſtitutions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But a Second reaſon of this variety, may reaſonably be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to ariſe <hi>from a difference of guilt.</hi> It is true, every ſin deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Eternal, and utmoſt wrath of God. Every ſin is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an infinite God, and hath a kind of infinity, and unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurableneſs of guilt in it; but it is as true that every ſin doth not lay a like load, and burthen upon the conſcience, nor is every ſin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually hainous in the ſight of God; but is very much varied by the circumſtances of it, both by the circumſtances of the fact, and of the perſons that commit it. Some ſins do more <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſtare &amp; onerare conſcientiam,</hi> and conſequently a Chriſtian finds it an harder matter to perſuade himſelf that God will forgive him, than others: and hence it is not at all to be wondered, that when God cometh to call home ſuch a Soul, a <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> a <hi>Saul,</hi> a <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> &amp;c. He makes them to feel more of his power, and terrors, and keeps them at a longer diſtance, from any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his love; they have more highly provoked him, and poſſibly been a more eminent ſcandal; and it is but a righteous thing with God to make them feel the ſmart of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third thing, which may make this variety of God Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential dealings appear unto us, not <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> may be, <hi>The deſign which God hath upon ſuch a converted Soul;</hi> and that either with <hi>reſpect unto others,</hi> or, <hi>with reſpect to the carrying on of his work in his own Soul.</hi> 1. <hi>With reſpect unto others;</hi> when God hath a deſign to make ſome Soul eminently uſeful to the Souls of others. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18. That Chriſt was himſelf <hi>tempted, that he might be able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted;</hi> and bleſſeth God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>comforteth us in all tribulation, that we may be able to comfort thoſe which are in any trouble, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort wherewith we our ſelves are comforted of God.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> that he was wont to ſay, that <hi>Three things make a Divine, Temptations, Meditation</hi> and <hi>Prayers. Luther</hi> was himſelf a man of great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and by them became able to ſuccour thoſe that were temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:192227:384"/>No knowledg is like <hi>experimental knowledg,</hi> none knoweth either how to <hi>ſympathize</hi> with, or how to ſuccor thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>temptations, deſertions,</hi> or any Soul-troubles, ſo well as thoſe who themſelves have been under them; experience is a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs: when therefore God hath a deſign upon ſome Souls, to make uſe of them for ſuccor, and relief of others under Soul-troubles and afflictions, he often firſt brings themſelves under them, and ſupports and comforts them, then they know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon, how to comfort and relieve. 2. Again, God may be conceived reaſonably to do it, <hi>upon a gracious deſign, in order to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of his work in their own Souls:</hi> we know not what manner of Spirit we are of, God knoweth all our tempers, ſeeth all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and diſpoſitions. 1.

He may poſſibly <hi>ſee ſome of more brisk, and airy tempers,</hi> more inclined to pride, and being lifted up above meaſure, and therefore thinks fit to keep them longer under the Spirit of bondage; as he did with <hi>Paul,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been rapt up into the third Heaven, and heard <hi>unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable words,</hi> leſt (as he ſaith) he ſhould be exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, God gave <hi>him a thorn in the fleſh.</hi> Thus now I have given you ſome little account of the variety of Gods Providential diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions toward Souls, in the collation of the firſt grace; but now I have done, I can only ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 26.14. <hi>Lo theſe are parts of his wayes, but how little a portion is heard of him!</hi> The end of all this diſcourſe is not to pretend to give you all the reaſon of God in theſe his diſpenſations, for <hi>who can by ſearching find out God, who can find out the Almighty unto perfection?</hi> we muſt ſay ſuch knowledg is <hi>too wonderful for us,</hi> but only to ſhew you, that this various way of Gods dealing with Souls, whom he intendeth to bring to Heaven, is not ſuch, but it will approve it ſelf to the reaſon of every reaſonable Creature, and ſuch as is very equitable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the wiſe God, in order to the compaſſing of his moſt wiſe and
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:192227:385"/>glorious ends. Let me now ſhew you what uſe is proper for us to make of theſe meditations and obſervations.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. In the firſt place this may mind us to <hi>take heed of a raſh judgment, either in our own caſe or in the caſes of others;</hi> we are very prone to give our ſelves needleſs trouble, and to paſs unrighteous Judgments concerning the work of God upon our own, and others Souls. One concludeth he hath as yet no work of God upon his heart, he was <hi>never humbled,</hi> never ſo broken upon the Wheel, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver under ſuch legal terrors, nor ſo long under the Spirit of bondage as ſome others; he cannot give an account to himſelf of any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, nor of any certain Sermon, when, or whereby God wrought upon, and changed his heart; and we are too too ready, to ſit in Judgment upon the work of God, alſo on the Souls of others. You have heard that the <hi>ways of God are paſt finding out.</hi> God doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tread the ſame path, and the variety which God uſeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Souls under different circumſtances, and for different ends, is very reaſonable: we have all of us reaſon enough to be troubled if we do not find this great work wrought in our Souls; but if we do find, that our hearts are changed, that the work is done for the way or means, or time, which God hath taken or uſed to do it in, or by, we have no ſuch reaſon to be ſollicitous; thoſe who are come to work in the Vineyard at the Ninth, or Eleventh, hour ſhall have their Penny, as well as thoſe who were called, and came in at the <hi>Sixth hour:</hi> God doth not always work in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and method, he is not to be tracked in his ways. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Soul lyeth in the change of the heart; (I would not with any truſt to Baptiſmal <hi>converſion, or regeneration</hi>) If the heart be changed, if the Soul be renewed, according to the Image of God; if old things be paſſed away in it, and all things become new, whether it was done, this, or that way, by this, or that means, in this, or that manner, is no juſt cauſe at all of trouble to us: God hath ſeveral ways to do his work by; we muſt paſs a judgment upon our ſelves, from what we find within our ſelves, the frames, and tempers of our Spirits; for <hi>what man knoweth</hi> the things of a man, but the Spirit of a man, which is within him. But we muſt judge of others from the change we ſee in their lives and converſations. <hi>Man looketh upon the outward appearance, but God looketh upon the heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. If we look upon our Neighbour, and there appear no ſpots upon him, but what may be the ſpot of Gods people; no markes of <hi>profaneneſs,</hi> or <hi>impiety</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:192227:385"/>God, nor of <hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> toward man, but he appeareth to us one, who <hi>herein exerciſed himſelf, to keep a good conſcience both toward God, and towards men,</hi> we ought to judge this perſon, one whoſe heart God hath changed. If we look into our own hearts, and can find that we truly love God, and hate evil, that we are afraid to ſin againſt God, and are deſirous in all things to pleaſe him, though we cannot find, that the ways of God with our Souls in our converſion, have been like the ways of God with the Souls of other men; yet we ought not in this caſe to judge, or to condemn our ſelves, Gods ways are not alike with every Soul. Its work in the effect (as to the main) is alike, for it is true, as to every man, that <hi>except he be born of water, and of the Spirit, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> but his way of working is not the ſame.</p>

In the Second place, what you have heard affordeth <hi>great encouragement to every Soul under any circumſtance to turn unto God, that it may live, and not dye.</hi> God calleth into his Vineyard, at ſeveral hours; ſome he calleth at the Sixth, ſome at the Nineth, ſome at the <hi>Eleventh</hi> hour. Happy, thrice happy are they, whom God findeth at the Sixth hour, in their youth, and perſuadeth to go into his Vineyard; they ordinarily find not ſo <hi>hard a labour</hi> of the new-birth, they have the priviledg of a longer familiarity, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God, they have more opportunities of doing God ſervice; God often honoreth them to do him ſome more eminent ſervice: but if you have ſlipped that hour, if it be the Ninth hour; nay, if it be in the wane of your life; if it be towards <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening</hi> with you, that you have nothing to do, but to repent and dye, ſinging the Song of old <hi>Simeon. Now Lord, let thy ſervant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy Salvation;</hi> yet, thou haſt no cauſe to diſcourage thy ſelf. God doth not work upon all Souls at one and the ſame period of time. Great ſinners have no reaſon to <hi>diſcourage themſelves;</hi> the gate to Heaven may appear ſomething ſtraiter to you, than unto others; you may have an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der work of it: it is an hard thing for thoſe <hi>that are accuſtomed to do evil, to do well:</hi> but yet, if God will give you an heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, if the Lord ſhall change your hearts, and incline you to turn unto him, there is mercy with God even for you, God can men make to bring forth fruit in their old age.</p>

God ſometimes in the converſion of ſinners ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his way to their hearts by their heads, ſanctifying notions of truth dropt into Souls of perſons in their tender years, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting them many years after upon the conſcience; you <hi>know not which ſhall proſper, this or that:</hi> uſe them to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be examined, queſtioned, and catechiſed out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to hear lively and powerful preaching; you know not which ſhall proſper in order to the converſion of their Souls, and turning them to God, this, or that, whether reading, or preaching, or Family-inſtruction: God that can work without means, uſeth as you have heard a variety of means, and doth not limit himſelf to this, or that.

                  <p>THE Particle <hi>This,</hi> in the front of my Text, is relative to what went before, where the Prophet had been ſpeaking of ſome works of Divine Providence, and thoſe but of an inferiour Nature, if compared with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the <hi>diſcretion</hi> by which men having divers ſorts of Grain, and Seeds, are taught to get them out of their husks, and ears, by inſtruments not always the ſame, but ſuted to the reſpective Grain, or Seed, they intend to get out. Of this it is, that the Text ſpeaks, This <hi>diſcretion,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>it cometh from the Lord, who is wonderful in Counſel:</hi> So that I deſire you to obſerve, that my following diſcourſes which I ſhall bottom on this Text, are not founded on the firſt words, and the relative Particle <hi>This;</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the latter, where Gods <hi>wonderfulneſs in Counſel,</hi> and <hi>excellency in working</hi> are join'd together. Gods excellency in the workings of Providence floweth from his wonderful Counſel; and if ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>inſtincts</hi> as the foregoing verſes ſpeak of, be from the Lord, the Lords <hi>workings,</hi> and from a wonderful Counſel, an eaſie argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will conclude, that Gods diſpenſations of ſpecial grace by
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:192227:387"/>the hand of his Providence, muſt needs be the effects of infinite wiſdom, and proceed from the Lord, who is <hi>wonderful in Councel;</hi> which is the point I have in hand, and to vindicate Divine wiſdom from our exceptions againſt it, becauſe of the variety which God uſeth in his diſpenſations of it, and the inequal diſtributions of it to the Children of men. I have ſpoken already to the <hi>varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Providence,</hi> in the <hi>diſpenſations</hi> of the <hi>firſt grace, by which a Soul is converted, and turned from ſin unto God,</hi> in which work the Soul is <hi>meerly paſſive.</hi> I come now to ſpeak to thoſe diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Spiritual grace,</hi> wherein the Soul is not <hi>meerly paſſive, but active;</hi> as to theſe, alſo we ſhall obſerve a great variety in the motions of Divine Providence, and a great inequality in the diſtributions of it, of which I ſhall give you ſome account, and then ſhut up the diſcourſe. To this <hi>inequality of diſtribution,</hi> good Chriſtians often find it an hard thing to reconcile their thoughts: and although God muſt be allowed to have a power, to do with his own what he pleaſeth, and if <hi>Grace</hi> were not for <hi>Gods own,</hi> it would be no <hi>Grace;</hi> yet, we are too too much like Children, who conſidering not their Fathers <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,</hi> nor it may be their own <hi>demerits,</hi> and their own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs to receive ſuch a favour, nor poſſibly their <hi>incapacity,</hi> to receive, <hi>injoy,</hi> or uſe it: Yet becauſe they are <hi>Children,</hi> as well as their <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Siſters,</hi> know not how to brook it, that their Father ſhould appear more kind to any of them, than he is to them. Let me therefore attempt the vindication of God in the inequality of theſe diſpenſations; and that you may know in what order to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, I ſhall lay down this method.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, I will ſhew you wherein <hi>this inequality lieth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, I will endeavour to ſhew you the reaſonableneſs of the motions of Divine Providence, in making this unequal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, I ſhall make ſome Application of it practically.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us firſt enquire wherein <hi>this inequality lieth.</hi> In the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <hi>It lieth not in any influxes, and diſpenſations of grace neceſſary in order to the Salvation of their ſouls.</hi> There is an union betwixt Chriſt and every believer; in this union lieth the <hi>ſpiritual life</hi> of a Chriſtian: as the <hi>natural life</hi> lieth in the union which is betwixt the ſoul and the body, ſo the ſpiritual life lieth in the union <hi>betwixt the ſoul and Chriſt;</hi> and as the union betwixt the ſoul and body is preſerved, and maintained by <hi>bodily nouriſhment;
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:192227:387"/>bleſſed</hi> be God, in order to that end: ſo the ſpiritual union betwixt the ſoul and Chriſt muſt alſo be maintained by a <hi>ſpiritual aliment:</hi> this <hi>aliment,</hi> or nouriſhment is the influx of the ſpirit of grace; for though Ordinances be external means, yet Ordinances ſignifie nothing without the influx of the ſpirit upon them, and in them. Now for ſuch an influence of grace, as is neceſſary to <hi>uphold</hi> the <hi>ſpiritual life</hi> of the believers, to keep the ſoul, and its beloved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, God giveth it to every believer; <hi>Whom he loveth, he loveth to the end:</hi> for if this were not ſo, there were a poſſibility of a <hi>total Apoſtacy,</hi> and of the <hi>interciſion of a ſtate of Juſtification.</hi> This would infer a mutability in the <hi>counſels</hi> and <hi>purpoſes of God,</hi> and ſubject the <hi>gifts and calling</hi> of God to <hi>repentance:</hi> For let <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay what they will, their <hi>fictitious purpoſe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> of God, to <hi>love thoſe that are believers,</hi> will not ſalve this ſore; for according to this Doctrine, a man may be a believer, and in favour with God this month, and an unbeliever and out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God the next month; and ſo God may love and hate the ſame perſon a thouſand times in his life-time: and whether this be conſiſtent with the unchangeableneſs of God, let any one judg, who underſtandeth any thing of common ſenſe. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtand fixed in this, that God neither is, nor ever will be wanting to any ſoul, as to thoſe <hi>influxes of Divine grace, which are neceſſary to maintain the union, and ſpiritual life</hi> of the ſoul: and (by the way) this well conſidered, might much tend to ſatisfie a ſoul diſſatisfied at Gods unequal diſtributions of ſpecial grace; which although they are exceedingly ſweet, and of high advantage to gracious ſouls; yet are ſuch, as are not of the <hi>neceſſaries of Salvation,</hi> but only <hi>gradual manifeſtations,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>ſpiritual accomodations,</hi> and <hi>advantages to it in its way to Heaven:</hi> but this is enough to have ſpoken to this queſtion Negatively. I come now to ſpeak nore Poſitively: In the general, they are ſuch only as reſpect the <hi>porro eſſe,</hi> or the advantages of ſpiritual life. Now what they are, comes next into our enquiry: They are I think reducible to Three heads; the influences of 1. <hi>Strengthening.</hi> 2. <hi>Quickning.</hi> 3. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory grace.</hi> That there are ſuch influences, and that all have not a like meaſures of them, no, nor the ſame ſoul at all times; is ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the <hi>experience</hi> of all Chriſtians, that little need be ſaid of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For <hi>ſtrengthening grace, I can do all things,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> It is that which the Apoſtle prayeth for, in the behalf of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Eph. 3.16. <hi>That he
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:192227:388"/>would grant you according to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit in the inward-man.</hi> And thus Chriſt tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>Without me you can do nothing.</hi> Now the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this influx of grace, is <hi>duty,</hi> or <hi>ſin and temptation to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Duty; I can do all things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me:</hi> Chriſtians duty is various, and lieth in ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the inward, and of the outward man; both in <hi>doing,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering,</hi> as God hath any-where in his Word required of us. <hi>Strengthening grace,</hi> with reſpect unto duty, is nothing elſe but the <hi>graeious influence of Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1.3.14. 2 Tim. 4.7.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Spirit of Chriſt upon the ſoul, by which the Soul is made more able both to do, and ſuffer the will of God.</hi> Now, that there is a great variety, and unequal diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this influence of Divine grace, both to different ſouls, and to the ſame ſoul at different times, is ſo obvious, as would be perfectly needleſs to ſpend any time in the proof of it; neither do all ſouls find the ſame degrees of <hi>ſpiritual ſtrength,</hi> nor do the ſame ſouls find it at all times.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Object, about which <hi>ſtrengthening grace</hi> is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>motions and temptations to ſin.</hi> That which we call <hi>ſtrengthening grace,</hi> with reference to <hi>ſin,</hi> is a ſecret influx of the ſpirit of holineſs, by which the ſoul of a Chriſtian findeth it ſelf inabled to reſiſt its inward motions to ſin, and to repel <hi>temptations</hi> from the World, and the Devil. St. <hi>James</hi> telleth us, That <hi>every one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own luſt, and enticed.</hi> This is that which Divines call, <hi>tentationem à carne,</hi> a temptation from the fleſh: beſides, we know that the <hi>evil ſpirit</hi> hath a power to make impreſſions, and to offer ſuggeſſions to us; and that either <hi>immediately,</hi> or by wicked men, and ſinful inſtruments: this is that which they call, <hi>tentationem ab hoſte,</hi> a temptation from our grand Adverſary: and there is a temptation wherein both theſe concur; this is that which they call, a <hi>mixt temptation:</hi> Now as to all, It is our duty to <hi>reſiſt,</hi> and this is <hi>the fighting the good fight,</hi> the maintaining that <hi>ſpiritual combate,</hi> which the Scripture ſpeaks of. Now there is nothing more evident in matter of Fact amongſt Chriſtians, than that ſome Chriſtians are more ſtrong, and able to reſiſt motions to ſin, of any nature, than others; they are more able to <hi>mortifie their members,</hi> and the <hi>deeds of the body</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.) <hi>through the ſpirit.</hi> Yea, one and the ſame Chriſtian doth not find the like degrees of this ſpiritual ſtrength and ability at all times. There was a time when <hi>David</hi>
                     <pb n="685" facs="tcp:192227:388"/>complained, that <hi>iniquities prevailed againſt him,</hi> Pſal. 65.3. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> cried out, <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death:</hi> And another time when he could ſay, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond diſpenſation of Grace, is that which I called <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening grace: An influx of the</hi> ſpirit of grace upon the ſoul, by which the ſoul in all its <hi>ſpiritual converſation, is made more free and lively;</hi> that it <hi>maketh haſte,</hi> and <hi>delayeth not, to keep the Lord's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> It findeth an <hi>inlarged heart, and runneth the way of the Lords Commandments:</hi> that this proceedeth from an influx of grace, is plain: <hi>David</hi> prayeth unto the Lord, that he would <hi>quicken him in the way of his Commandments. Quicken me in thy way,</hi> Pſal. 119.37. It is as manifeſt upon the experience of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that God diſtributeth this influence of this grace unequally, neither the like meaſures unto <hi>all Chriſtians,</hi> nor to the ſame Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at all times: Hence are the complaints of Chriſtians, of the <hi>dulneſs,</hi> and <hi>deadneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſtraitneſs of their hearts:</hi> they indeed, through grace, keep on in the Lords ways, and are kept from <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> they return not with the <hi>Dog to the vomit;</hi> but they move heavily, the <hi>wheels of their Charots</hi> are taken off, they almoſt force themſelves to duties of Communion with God, and do not find a freedom to them, and a delight and ſweetneſs in them; but are ſecretly ſaying within themſelves, <hi>When will the Sabbath be done?</hi> When <hi>will the duty be over?</hi> it is no pleaſure to them to ſerve the Lord; when-as at other times, their ſouls are <hi>full of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life,</hi> they are longing for Sabbaths, and for times of prayer.</p>

Laſtly, <hi>There are alſo diſpenſations of conſolatory grace:</hi> theſe are <hi>the influences of the Spirit of God upon the ſoul, by which the ſoul is refreſhed and comforted in the apprehenſions of the love of God.</hi> Theſe admit of a variety of degrees, as they ariſe in the ſoul, either, 1. <hi>From the view of the ſouls own ſincerity, and its ability to apprehend its intereſt in the promiſes, and to apply the Scripture unto it ſelf.</hi> Or 2. From <hi>ſome more extraordinary witneſſings, and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the holy Spirit,</hi> who, you know, is called the <hi>Comforter,</hi> and who, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>witneſſeth together with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God.</hi> Now the ſadneſs, and dejections of ſome Chriſtians ſpirits over others, and of the ſame Chriſtians Spirits, at ſome times more than others, is a ſufficient evidence of the inequality of theſe diſtributions. There was a time, when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> himſelf cried out, <hi>When wilt thou comfort me?</hi> Pſal. 119.82.
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:192227:389"/>as much as at other times, he <hi>triumphed,</hi> and <hi>made his boaſt</hi> in God: and from hence now you may underſtand the nature of what we call <hi>Deſertions.</hi> God never leaves nor forſakes his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo as he doth not ſupply them with influences of Grace ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to uphold the Union betwixt Chriſt and their ſouls, nor doth he deny ſuch influences to any ſoul that believeth in Chriſt: But God may and doth often withdraw himſelf, as to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual manifeſtations of himſelf to them, in ſuch diſpenſations of grace whereby he <hi>ſtrengtheneth them</hi> againſt <hi>ſin,</hi> or unto <hi>duty;</hi> or whereby he quickneth them, and maketh them free and lively in his Service; or finally ſuch, whereby he comforteth them with the apprehenſions, or aſſurances of his love in Chriſt. Now theſe varieties being obſervable in matter of fact, in the diſpenſations of Divine grace, even to Gods own children; My next work muſt be to ſhew you the reaſonableneſs of the motions of Divine Providence, in this unequal diſtribution, and to proportion ſome anſwer to theſe following Queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Queſt. <hi>Why God ſuffereth ſome more than others to be tempted, and to fall by temptation, yea, ſome of his own people?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Queſt. <hi>Whence it is, that ſome of the children of God find much more ſtrength unto ſpiritual duty than others find, and the ſame children of God, at ſome time find more ſtrength than they do at others times?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Queſt. <hi>Whence it is, that ſome godly perſons find more freedom and livelineſs in the ſervice of God, than others do; and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons find more livelineſs and freedom at one time than they do at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Queſt. <hi>Whence it is, that ſome Chriſtians are more full of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual joy and conſolations than others are?</hi> To theſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly relate to the varieties before obſerved, Two more may alſo be added.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Queſt. <hi>Whence it is, that godly perſons who are all informed by the ſame ſpirit of truth, have ſuch different apprehenſions of the things of God, one from another, and that ſome times in very momentous points?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Queſt. Laſtly, <hi>Whence it is, that ſome Chriſtians grow faſter in grace than others do?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Queſt. <hi>Why God ſuffereth ſome, yea, ſome of his own dear ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be more tempted than others, yea, and when he knoweth that they will fall?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it is ſo, is paſt all diſpute. <hi>Satan</hi> obtained leave of God
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:192227:389"/>to tempt <hi>Job,</hi> and Chriſt told <hi>Peter,</hi> that he had deſired to <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now him like wheat;</hi> he tempted <hi>David to number the people:</hi> The Text ſaith, that <hi>Satan ſtood up againſt Iſrael;</hi> and we know that <hi>Satan</hi> prevailed againſt all theſe: And it is expreſly ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that God <hi>left him</hi> to his temptations, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. And we ſee it in daily experience, that ſome of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are both much more <hi>buffetted</hi> by <hi>Satans temptations,</hi> and overcome by them than others are; wanting ſtrength to ſay, <hi>get thee behind me Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, <hi>I do think much of this is founded, or at leaſt highly advantaged from nature.</hi> Concerning temptations which are, <hi>à carne,</hi> from the fleſh, when a man is only <hi>drawn away by his own luſt:</hi> There is nothing more certain, than that divers perſons have more <hi>ſtrong inclinations</hi> and <hi>diſpoſitions to ſome ſins</hi> than unto others; and there needeth a more eminent aſſiſtance of <hi>Divine grace,</hi> to reſtrain ſuch luſts in ſuch ſouls: and although it be true concerning ſuch <hi>temptations</hi> as are <hi>impreſſions,</hi> or <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi> from <hi>Satan,</hi> that they are not natural, but <hi>preternatural;</hi> yet one ſoul may have a more <hi>natural aptitude to receive them,</hi> either from <hi>its complexion</hi> and <hi>conſtitution,</hi> or from its <hi>diſeaſe</hi> and <hi>diſtemperature,</hi> under which it may at ſome time labour more than another; and this may by one, and that a great cauſe. For God is not always, nor ordinarily pleaſed to work miraculouſly. It is uſually ſaid of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> that it is <hi>balneum diaboli,</hi> a melancholick temper, ſtate, or conſtitution of body, is a temper very receptive of impreſſions and ſuggeſtions from the Devil. Now I ſay, where a man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally more complexionated to ſome ſins, or where any perſons are from their complexion, or from ſome bodily diſtemper more apt to receive ſuch kind of impreſſions, it cannot be expected, but that they ſhould fall oftner into ſuch temptations, and be troubled more with them, and by them, than other Chriſtians, who have not thoſe natural diſadvantages; and it can hardly be expected that they ſhould ordinarily be freed from that natural incumbrance, by ſpecial, and eminent aſſiſtances of Divine grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place, Mens <hi>different ſinnings</hi> may make this alſo appear but <hi>a reaſonable motion of Providence:</hi> It is true, it is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful puniſhment of ſin, for God to puniſh the ſins of people, by ſuffering them to be <hi>led into temptation.</hi> It is a dreadful curſe, or imprecation of <hi>David</hi> upon the enemies of the Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.6. <hi>Set thou a wicked man over him, and let Satan ſtand at his
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:192227:390"/>right hand.</hi> God doth thus often puniſh peoples ſins, by letting <hi>Satan</hi> looſe upon them: the effects of this are ſad enough, none need a greater evil than to have <hi>Satan always at his right hand,</hi> aſſiduouſly and violently moving him unto evil; and though it be not ſo ordinary, yet God may thus puniſh his own people. <hi>Satan</hi> was at <hi>David</hi>'s right hand, when he would number the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a <hi>meſſenger of Satan ſent to buffet him:</hi> what that <hi>meſſenger of Satan was,</hi> is not ſo eaſie to determine; it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſome great affliction in which <hi>Satan</hi> had a particular mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. Some Divines do think it was ſome <hi>great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> indeed the Scripture doth not mention it as the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſin, but as preventive of ſin, <hi>leſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſhould be exalted above meaſure.</hi> Undoubtedly <hi>temptations</hi> may be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſin, and in thoſe deſperate temptations to ſelf-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have prevailed againſt men, the <hi>ſin</hi> hath been often made evident: and poſſibly as to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> God might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>Paul</hi>'s heart begin to ſwell, upon occaſion of his Revelations, and might ſend him a meſſenger of Satan to <hi>buffet him,</hi> as well for the <hi>beginnings of the workings of Pride,</hi> which he had diſcerned in him, as to prevent the further increaſes of it. It is not ſo eaſie to determine what <hi>Davids ſin was,</hi> but in probability it was <hi>pride: Davids</hi> heart was <hi>lifted up,</hi> upon the view of the great number of people which God had put under his Government; God letteth looſe <hi>Satan</hi> upon him, he moveth <hi>David to number the people,</hi> by which he knew God would be ſufficiently provoked, to abate that wherein he glory'd. The caſe was much the ſame with <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> though we do not read of ſo eminent and immediate a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of <hi>Satan.</hi> The Text ſaith, <hi>God left him:</hi> it was in the pride of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> heart, that he would ſhew his Treaſure to the <hi>King of Babylon;</hi> God leaves him, the temptation prevails upon him. This by the way, doth not only let us ſee, that God ſometimes by temptations puniſheth his own people for their ſin; but that <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ſwelling of our hearts, upon the account of our enjoyments, is one of thoſe ſins for which God ſuffereth Satan to ſtand at our right hand. Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity</hi> is another ſin, an itch after knowledg, which God hath hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from us: It is a ſad ſtory how many have been thus catched in the ſnare of the Devil; indeed our firſt Mother <hi>Eve</hi> was thus catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but this were too large a Theme to inſtance in all thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins which God hath thus puniſhed, or may thus puniſh. Now in regard that the <hi>ſins</hi> of all Gods people are not equal, but
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:192227:390"/>they may fall (ſome of them) into more great, and hainous ſins than others: It is but a reaſonable motion of Divine Providence, that ſuch as do ſo, ſhould be more troubled with Satan <hi>at their right hand,</hi> with <hi>meſſengers of Satan ſent to buffet them,</hi> than others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third reaſonable account of this may be <hi>Gods Prerogative.</hi> God may do it for <hi>the trial of their graces.</hi> I know not what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account we can give, <hi>than this,</hi> of Gods diſpenſations to <hi>Job.</hi> God himſelf gives thus, this account of him, <hi>then he was a juſt and upright man.</hi> Yet he giveth <hi>Satan</hi> leave to <hi>ſtand at his right hand,</hi> he tells him, <hi>all that he had was in his power, but only his life.</hi> It is ſaid, that God left <hi>Hezekiah to try what was in his heart; to try, that he might know all that was in his heart.</hi> Divines diſpute about that Pronoun <hi>He,</hi> whether it referreth unto God, or to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. The matter I do not conceive much, whether it referreth to one, or to the other. <hi>That God might know what was in his heart.</hi> Did not then (you will ſay,) God know what was in the heart of <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> Doubtleſs, he to whom all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies were naked, who knew all things paſt, preſent, and to come, could not be ignorant what was in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s <hi>heart,</hi> and what he would do when he left him. But the Scripture often ſpeaketh of God, after the manner of men; they know not ſecret, hidden things, till they be brought to demonſtration: God left him, that he might know, that is, <hi>that he might in matter of fact ſee what was in his heart.</hi> This could be no matter of pleaſure, and delight to the Holy God, but only a <hi>juſt medium,</hi> in order to the puniſhment, which he intended <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the poſterity of that good man. But God leaveth many of the Souls of his People, that they <hi>may be tempted,</hi> and in the hour of their temptation, put forth, exert, and exerciſe their grace, in the exerciſe of which the Lord hath a great deal of pleaſure and delight. This ſeemeth to be the caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> the ſecond time that you read <hi>Job</hi> 1. of <hi>Satans</hi> appearance before God: God glorieth in <hi>Job, Job</hi> 2.3. <hi>Haſt thou</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in the Earth, a perfect, and upright man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth evil, and ſtill he holdeth faſt his integrity, although thou mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedſt me againſt him to deſtroy him without cauſe,</hi> Job 2.3. God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the combates of his People, where they come off <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors;</hi> yea, <hi>more than Conquerors.</hi> I remember thoſe two great Commanders, <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi> once ſaid, Let the young men <hi>ariſe and play before us:</hi> that was a <hi>bloody game,</hi> for they mutually
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:192227:391"/>kill'd each other: ſo were the <hi>Romans Gladiators games,</hi> and the <hi>combates with wild Beaſts,</hi> to which they expoſed ſome miſerable Creatures; yet, thoſe men of blood took a pleaſure in them: God knoweth <hi>the good fight</hi> ſhall have no ſuch iſſue. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not <hi>tempted</hi> for nothing, the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>he was therefore temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he might be able to ſuccour them that were tempted:</hi> himſelf told <hi>Peter,</hi> that although <hi>Satan</hi> had deſired to <hi>winnow</hi> him <hi>like Wheat,</hi> yet, he <hi>had prayed, that his faith might not fail.</hi> This being ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, God delighted to ſee <hi>Satan,</hi> and a <hi>believing Soul play before him;</hi> to ſee his People exerciſing their <hi>knowledg, faith, love, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, courage,</hi> and <hi>fortitude,</hi> in <hi>reſiſting</hi> Satans temptations and making him to flee from them. Now who can deny unto God the ſatisfaction and pleaſure which he taketh <hi>in the exerciſe of thoſe habits of grace which he hath given them?</hi> The uſe of that Spiritual armour which he hath armed them with?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, It is but a reaſonable motion of Divine <hi>Providence, with reference to the different ſervice which he hath for ſome to do.</hi> It is ſaid of Chriſt that <hi>he was therefore tempted, that he might be able to ſuccour them that are tempted. We are not ignorant of his wiles,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) the Apoſtle not being himſelf ignorant of <hi>Satans wiles</hi> made him more fit to caution, and inſtruct others with reference to them. You know it is a great advantage to a Family, with reference to the <hi>ſmall Pox,</hi> or other contagious Diſeaſes, to have ſome members of it, to have laboured under, and eſcaped thoſe Diſeaſes. The Church of God, which is his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, could not well be without ſome Souls, that have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der temptations; none knows ſo well, how to ſpeak to, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves unto thoſe that are tempted, as thoſe who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have gone through that fire; they are beſt able to teach others in their own former circumſtances, what to do, and what to avoid. They know how to <hi>ſtrengthen them,</hi> with thoſe words which themſelves in their circumſtances <hi>heard from God,</hi> and to <hi>comfort them, with thoſe conſolations with which they themſelves were comforted by God.</hi> It is therefore reaſonable that ſome ſhould be tempted, becauſe all are in ſubjection to temptations, and may be tempted, and therefore had need of ſome Nurſes to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them. On the other ſide it is <hi>unreaſonable that all ſhould be tempted,</hi> for who then ſhould there be Miniſterial to ſuccour the tempted? Nor let any ſay, This were indeed ſomething, if none were tempted, but ſuch as conquered the tempters; but how
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:192227:391"/>doth God ſuffer thoſe to be tempted, who he knoweth will fall?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fifthly therefore, Neither is this unreaſonable: <hi>For there is a difference of fallings: God ſuffereth none of his own People to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who ſhall finally fall.</hi> They <hi>may fall,</hi> but <hi>let not their enemy rejoice over them;</hi> though they fall, they ſhall riſe again. <hi>Job</hi> fell, but he roſe again; <hi>Peter</hi> fell in the hour of temptation, he denied his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and that <hi>with curſing</hi> and <hi>ſwearing;</hi> but his Maſter looked upon him, <hi>he went out, and wept bitterly.</hi> God indeed may ſuffer a reprobate to be tempted, who he knoweth, <hi>will fall,</hi> and ſo fall as to riſe no more, but he never ſuffereth his Saints to fall finally. <hi>Satan</hi> may ſtand at <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s right hand to reſiſt him, but God will ſay unto Satan, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath choſen Hieruſalem rebuke thee, is not this a brand plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked out of the fire?</hi> Believers may be tempted, but <hi>God will bruiſe Satan under their feet ſhortly.</hi> Now, if the queſtion be intended of <hi>mediate fallings,</hi> not a <hi>final falling;</hi> why ſuffereth God his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be tempted, who he knowes will <hi>get a</hi> fall <hi>under the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> though they ſhall riſe again? I have anſwered it before, when I ſhewed you, why God <hi>permitteth his People to ſin;</hi> he would certainly not do it, if he did not know how from their <hi>falls,</hi> to extract his own glory. An ancient Writer gives us a large account of this. That (ſaith he) the wiſdom of God might be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, who can bring good out of evil, for God is ſo good, and infinitely wiſe, that he would never ſuffer evil to be, if he did not know how from it to elicit, and draw out that which is good: That the goodneſs of God might be made glorious, in pardoning and raiſing up the elect, and the Juſtice of God might be glorified, in the righteous condemnation of others. That men might be deprived of their natural freedom in acting: nor, ſaith he, is it reaſonable, that the ſinfulneſs of the Creature ſhould hinder the exhibition of the Divine goodneſs: That by his Saints repentance and victory at laſt, they might have a more glorious Crown; and that they might know, and ſee what is in their own hearts, and how much they live upon Divine grace, and like burnt children, they might more dread the fire, and take heed afterward of having any confidence in themſelves. Finally, which is all in ſhort, (for enumeration of particulars in this caſe, would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and incertain) thus much we may be aſſured of God, he would never ſuffer any <hi>elect Veſſel,</hi> to be <hi>bored through</hi> with a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he did not know how to make it iſſue in his more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant glory, and their more abundant good.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Applic.</hi> Suffer me now before I proceed to the other Queſtions, to make ſome ſhort Application of this diſcourſe, the ſum of which is no more but this, <hi>That as to converted Souls, God doth not equally diſtribute the influence of ſpecial grace.</hi> Although he diſtributeth to all, ſo much as is neceſſary to the upholding of the Union of their Souls with Chriſt, and to maintain the Spiritual life, ſo as the Oyl doth not fail from the Cruiſe, nor the Meal ſhall not fail from the Barrel, until they come into their glory; yet, for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of his love, in ſuch influences of grace, as are only of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage unto Souls in their way to Heaven, ſuch as ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, quickning, and conſolating influences, God variouſly diſtributeth them according to his infinite wiſdom: he gives to ſome an <hi>Omer,</hi> to others an <hi>Ephah,</hi> particularly I have ſhewed it you in thoſe influences of grace, by which God ſtrengtheneth the Soul, in the reſiſting of <hi>temptations;</hi> and I have ſhewed you the reaſonableneſs, and ſomething of the wiſdom God, in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations. Now from this Diſcourſe let us learn divers things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Inſt. Firſt, the differences <hi>betwixt</hi> the neceſſary <hi>influences of grace,</hi> and ſuch as are not <hi>abſolutely neceſſary,</hi> but of high advantage to a Soul in its way to Heaven. Grace is neceſſary, (<hi>by grace ye are ſaved,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle) but all grace is not neceſſary. The grace of <hi>juſtification</hi> is neceſſary. <hi>Except a man be born again,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>he can never enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Every Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath this, he is born again, he is ſanctified in body, and mind and ſpirit. But now there are further <hi>manifeſtations;</hi> which make <hi>gradual differences</hi> in Chriſtians, and the receit of which alſo doth much depend upon our action. For although in the firſt grace, the Soul be <hi>purely paſſive;</hi> yet, as to the receiving of <hi>further</hi> grace it is <hi>active,</hi> therefore the promiſe of Chriſts manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. is made to them who love Chriſt, and keep his Commandments. I pray obſerve this, for it is a thing of no ſmall concernment. From hence,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Inſt. Secondly, you may eaſily conclude, <hi>how unreaſonable it is for any Soul to quarrel at God, or murmur againſt his diſpenſations, though it findeth not thoſe gradual manifeſtations of Divine love unto it, which others do experience from God.</hi> If thou beeſt equally dealt with, as to the <hi>neceſſaries of Salvation,</hi> thou mighteſt ſit down, ſo far ſatisfied as not to murmur at God, if as to the <hi>gradual manifeſtations of</hi> his love in ſome things, he will give unto another,
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:192227:392"/>more than unto thee. Every thing of Divine grace is ſweet, you muſt not therefore miſtake the tendency of my diſcourſe, as if I were perſwading you to ſuch a ſatisfaction, as not to thriſt and breath after, and labour for perfection in Spiritual <hi>ſtrength, life,</hi> and <hi>comfort,</hi> they are all things to be valued above Worlds: but only not to murmur, and repine againſt God as an inequal Father, or an hard Maſter, becauſe he doth not every way make your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life is ſweet, and perfect as others. And any complaint of this Nature is the more unreaſonable; becauſe for <hi>the moſt part it is to be laid upon our ſelves,</hi> and is like the Wifes quarrel with her Husband, for want of Children, when-as the Scripture generally layes the defect upon the Woman. So it is here generally; the reaſon why ſome Chriſtians have more ſadneſs, leſs ſtrength, and Spiritual life, or livelineſs, and vigour than others, is becauſe they have more ſin and corruption, and are more wanting in the uſe of that means, whichly upon them to uſe in order to their obtaining of ſuch degrees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. In the third place from this diſcourſe, it will not be hard for you to conclude, the duty of tempted Souls, <hi>in order to the abating of the force of a temptation,</hi> or <hi>wholly driving the tempter from them.</hi> Indeed, the whole of a Chriſtians duty, in order to this end, cannot be concluded from this diſcourſe, but much of it may.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, The uſe of <hi>Natural means, which may be proper for the correcting that bodily humour, or removing that natural diſtemper of which Satan</hi> takes <hi>advantage;</hi> that is in ſhort, whatſoever <hi>hindereth the free exerciſe of our reaſon,</hi> and conſequently keepeth us from <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a juſt judgment upon our ſelves,</hi> which you know we muſt do by the uſe of reaſon. I have often thought upon my experience of Souls under theſe circumſtances, that the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> is many times <hi>Gods Ordinance,</hi> as well as the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> for the ſuccour of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Souls; for Souls under theſe circumſtances, are not delivered miraculouſly, but in an ordinary way of Providence generally, which cannot be without <hi>ſome freedom of the exerciſe of their own reaſon, and judgment,</hi> to apply what they read in, or hear from the word of God. Hence it is, that I have often ſeen poor Souls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe dark circumſtances, <hi>to whom all reading of Scripture, all diſcourſes of Miniſters have ſignified little, or nothing, or at moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond a little preſent refreſhment:</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>their minds are darkned,</hi> and <hi>they have not the free uſe of their reaſon to make a concluſion to themſelves from premiſes, and principles,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:192227:393"/>of the word brought unto them,</hi> and opened unto them by the moſt able Miniſters of the Goſpel, who in theſe ſtreſſes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence have Miniſtered to them: not that I think there is nothing in what we call <hi>temptation,</hi> but <hi>melancholy:</hi> there is hardly any thing more demonſtrable to me, than that there is an hand, a great hand of <hi>Joab,</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> I mean, in the impreſſions we often find made upon, and ſuggeſtions that are made to perſons labouring under theſe <hi>bodily diſtempers.</hi> The ſuggeſtions to ſuch Souls to <hi>blaſpheme God,</hi> to <hi>deſtroy themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. (which are very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,) are certainly when they fall upon perſons, who are of knowledg, and have lived in aw, dread, and high reverence of God, more than the natural Products, and reſults of a diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature; which we may the rather conclude from the ſtrange violence, and impetuouſneſs of them ſo frequently returning, (as they oft do) and ſo ſtrangely reſiſting all arguments, and means uſed againſt them: beſides, <hi>melancholy,</hi> meer melancholy of its own Nature, renders the Soul <hi>fearful, jealous,</hi> and <hi>ſuſpicious</hi> of any thing, which may be hurtful to it; and though indeed the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher</hi> diſputes, <hi>ſelf-Murder</hi> to be the effect not of a <hi>valorous and couragious, but of a cowardly Spirit;</hi> yet it argueth a more Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural valour, than <hi>melancholy diſpoſeth and inclineth one unto.</hi> But this I think, the Devil taketh advantage of this bodily diſtemper, under the prevailing of which the Soul is weaker, being hindered in the exerciſe of its reaſon, that it is not able, either it ſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude as at other times, from what it hath read in the word of God, nor yet to apply what is offered unto it, from Miniſters of the Goſpel. So as in reaſon, unleſs we ſhould expect that God ſhould work out of the road of common Providence; the firſt thing to be done, is the uſe of <hi>Natural means,</hi> (with earneſt prayer to God for his bleſſing upon it,) for the correcting of that bodily humour, which prevailing clouds the mind, and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it from concluding reaſonably, in making a judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf; and I have often known, that in theſe caſes upon the uſe of due natural means, the temptation hath alſo vaniſhed, and gone away with the diſeaſe. I could give you one inſtance of a Perſon, a young Woman known to many of you, who of a ſudden had fallen under a <hi>great temptation,</hi> and was narrowly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in the <hi>deſtroying her ſelf, in the night-time;</hi> in the Morning, my ſelf was ſent for: ſhe having formerly often uſed to diſcourſe freely with me about her Eternal condition; when I came to her,
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:192227:393"/>I found her in great ſadneſs, and heavineſs of Spirit, but could draw out little diſcourſe from her: only <hi>ſhe was not Elected, ſhe was damned,</hi> &amp;c. with ſome few other <hi>deſperate concluſions.</hi> I left her advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her friends to ſend for a learned <hi>experienced Phyſitian to her.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the uſe of a little means, ſhe recovered her diſtempers, and I never heard of her temptation more. It is true, it is not thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, the natural diſtemper is ſometimes more ſtubborn, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth natural means, and <hi>Satan</hi> working at the advantage of that, doth many times much longer moleſt ſome; but I have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never known any, but in theſe caſes <hi>with the recovery of their health,</hi> have likewiſe recovered themſelves (through Gods bleſſing) <hi>out of that ſnare of the Devil,</hi> which he hath laid for them in their diſeaſe, and diſtempered condition of their body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing which this Diſcourſe prompteth tempted ſouls to, as proper for them, is <hi>a ſearching and examining their ways, a repentance and turning again unto the Lord.</hi> I have ſhewed you in this Diſcourſe, that <hi>temptations</hi> oft-times are puniſhments of ſin; and that the reaſonableneſs and wiſdom of God in theſe motions of Divine Providence, not equally ſtrengthening all ſouls in the reſiſtance of temptation, appeareth, as in other things, ſo in this; that God by <hi>keeping them longer under the buffetings of Satan,</hi> than he <hi>keepeth others,</hi> may make them more ſenſible wherein they have ſinned more than others: I know ſome Divines have thought, and do think, that God uſeth not to keep his people long in an hour of great <hi>temptation,</hi> but in deep puniſhment <hi>for hidden ſins.</hi> I do doubt that, eſpecially where the temptation is advantaged, from a continuing <hi>bodily melancholy:</hi> but withal, oftimes it is ſo; that ſome <hi>paſt ſins, concealed and hidden,</hi> give an advantage to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary; and that not only when we hide them from God, by not freely confeſſing them, and humbly bewailing them before him, who alone hath power to forgive them, (which alone is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to forgiveneſs.) This was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, Pſal. 32.3. <hi>When I kept ſilence, my bones waxed old, through my roaring all the day long: For day and night thine hand was heavy upon me: my moiſture was turned into the drought of Summer: I acknowledged my ſin unto thee, and mine iniquity I have not hid: I ſaid I will confeſs my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſins.</hi> There you have both the caſe and the cure. But ſometimes <hi>the concealing of ſome ſins from men,</hi> is a great cauſe of the long abiding of a <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and this moſtly happeneth in ſouls that are <hi>weak in knowledg,</hi>
                     <pb n="696" facs="tcp:192227:394" rendition="simple:additions"/>and not able of themſelves to find out, and apply to themſelves, that relief which is in Scripture for them under ſuch guilt; and therefore had need of the help of ſome ſpiritual Interpreter. But I ſay, in every hour of temptation, it is very proper to a <hi>tempted ſoul,</hi> to ſearch and ſee, if he can find no <hi>Achan that troubles him,</hi> or that provoketh God to puniſh him, by <hi>ſetting Satan,</hi> or by <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Satan to ſtand at his right hand:</hi> oftentimes (by the way) I have found ſins which have been <hi>acts of unrighteouſneſs towards men,</hi> where <hi>reſtitution hath not been made,</hi> or where <hi>reſtitution hath been unpoſſible,</hi> have a long time given advantage to the tempters ſuggeſtions; but where particular ſins cannot be fixed upon, (as it happeneth in many caſes, ſouls fall under great and exceeding troubleſome temptations, whom God hath yet all their life kept and reſtrained from ſuch erronious tranſgreſſions) I ſay where this happeneth. As <hi>Herod</hi> in great cruelty ſent and killed all the children to two years old, that he might be ſure not to miſs him, who was born King of the <hi>Jews;</hi> ſo it will be great policy and piety in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to confeſs all his ſins which he can remember, and charge himſelf with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; to ſtudy the mortifying of every member, that he may be ſure to fall upon that which doth offend him, and give the Adverſary advantage againſt him: hence it followeth, that frequent humiliation and prayer, frequent confeſſions of ſin, and prayer for the forgiveneſs of them through the blood of Chriſt, are exceeding proper works for ſouls under temptation. We may indeed concerning violent temptation, ſay as Chriſt ſaid of <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> with the Devil, it ſeldom cometh off without much faſting and prayer; yea, and <hi>holineſs of life,</hi> and <hi>watchfulneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin,</hi> is the ſingular duty of poor tempted ſouls; the ſoul is at ſuch a time in the ſpiritual fight. It was Gods ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that <hi>when the hoſt went forth to battel, then they ſhould take heed of every wicked thing:</hi> By a parity of reaſon, when the ſoul goeth out to the ſpiritual fight, and eſpecially when it is in the fight, it ſtandeth concerned to take heed of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God; ſin weakens the hand, and there is nothing more ordinary than for Chriſtians in thoſe circumſtances to be, <hi>de novo,</hi> troubled for their ſlips while they have been in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence (Thirdly) may eaſily be concluded the duty of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to take unto them the whole armour of God, that they may be able to ſtand</hi> againſt the wiles of the Devil, <hi>in the evil day, and having
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:192227:394"/>done all to ſtand,</hi> Eph. 6.13. not to yeild, but to <hi>reſiſt.</hi> Many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments might be brought to perſwade this ſpiritual reſiſtance; you have to do with a <hi>foiled Adverſary,</hi> you want not a <hi>ſpiritual aſſiſtance;</hi> Chriſt was therefore tempted, that he might be able to ſuccour you when tempted: he cannot conquer you, but by your <hi>voluntary ſurrender;</hi> (The <hi>will of man</hi> is a Fort, that is not to be ſtorm'd) many are the <hi>preſidents</hi> of thoſe that have reſiſted, and come out of the field conquerors, <hi>look unto Jeſus, the Captain of your ſalvation;</hi> he reſiſted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.11. <hi>The Devil leaveth him, and behold Angels came and miniſtred to him.</hi> After great temptations uſually come great <hi>conſolations,</hi> great manifeſtations of God to the ſouls of his people: But that which follows from this Diſcourſe, is, becauſe <hi>thus you ſhall fulfil the Lords end;</hi> this is good, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and well-pleaſing unto God. God himſelf (as I before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) glorieth in <hi>Jobs</hi> conqueſt, and checks the Devil upon it: God therefore bringeth you into the Field, that you might fight va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly, reſiſt manfully, and at laſt come out with a Garland of honour: O therefore take heed of caſting down your Arms, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining any thoughts of running away! They obſerve in Battles, that more are ſlain in a running away, than where they manfully maintain the fight; but in this fight none falleth, but he who yieldeth, and throweth down his Arms. They obſerve alſo in War, that the preſence of the Prince in the Field, viewing his Souldiers, who behave themſelves more or leſs valiantly, doth much animate Souldiers. You may be aſſured of this, That when you are in this Spiritual combate, your great <hi>General</hi> is in the Field: God is obſerving you, particularly obſerving, how you gird up your loins, ſtand to your Arms; how you behave your ſelves in the managery of the fight, and that he therefore ſuffereth you to be tempted, that he may ſee, <hi>what faith, what patience,</hi> what <hi>love to God,</hi> is in your hearts. But thus much ſhall ſerve to have ſpoken to this particular, to ſhew you the wiſdom of God, and the reaſonableneſs of his motions of Providence in ſuffering Souls to be more under temptation than others.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is nothing more demonſtrable in matter of fact, than that it is ſo; nothing more certain, than that God could make it otherwiſe: the Queſtion is, whence it is, and how the wiſdom, and the reaſonableneſs of Divine Providence appeareth in this diſpenſation? let me, before I come to ſpeak directly to the Queſtion, premiſe ſomething, 1. <hi>Concerning Spiritual duty.</hi> 2. Concerning <hi>Strengthning grace. Duty</hi> is a word of very large extent, comprehenſive of all the <hi>Acts,</hi> both of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Probity,</hi> wherein the Law of Nature, or the Law of God in Scripture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us debtors to our great Creator. It is uſually divided into our duty towards God, which is that which we call <hi>Piety,</hi> or, our duty <hi>toward man,</hi> which we call <hi>Probity;</hi> both of them ly in the motions of our <hi>hearts, tongues,</hi> or more <hi>external actions.</hi> Our duty towards man is much comprehended under the two <hi>generals</hi> of Juſtice, and Charity. Now for much of this duty, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth unto no man a <hi>ſufficient ſtrength and power,</hi> ſo as if he <hi>will, he may do it.</hi> No man will deny but a man hath <hi>a power,</hi> to <hi>deal juſtly,</hi> to <hi>give Alms to the Poor,</hi> and many other things, ſo as he is but an Hypocrite, that pretends <hi>want of ſtrength</hi> to many <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:192227:395"/>actions</hi> which God hath commanded him; which are but acts of <hi>moral diſcipline:</hi> hence it is no great wonder to hear the <hi>Patrons of freewil</hi> urge this as the whole duty of man. But alas, though this be his duty, yet it is but the leaſt part of his duty. Our great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God lies as in <hi>external acts of Piety,</hi> ſo in the <hi>internal government of the motions of our hearts affections,</hi> according to the rule of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law; it lyeth in <hi>external actions,</hi> ſuch as <hi>praying, hearing the word,</hi> &amp;c. But chiefly <hi>in the government of our inward man,</hi> that we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all our actions, whether reſpecting God or man, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he hath required. Now that which we call <hi>ſtrengthning grace,</hi> is, <hi>That influence of the holy Spirit upon the Soul, by which the Soul is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to perform whatſoever God requireth of it, both in doing and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in ſuch an acceptable manner, as God requireth at our hands.</hi> Duty may be divided, 1. <hi>Into ſuch acts which are in our own power, as to the external acts, to perform without any Spiritual gifts; or more ſpecial influences of grace:</hi> thus a man may read the word, he may hear Sermons, he may do acts of juſtice, and charity, and many other things, by virtue of the common Providence of God, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in man his natural faculties; for this now there needeth none of that ſpecial <hi>ſtrengthning grace,</hi> about which I am diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Secondly,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as a <hi>man may perform</hi> by vertue <hi>of common gifts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,</hi> ſuch as <hi>knowledg, utterance,</hi> &amp;c. Which although God doth not give unto all, yet he doth give unto many, who never taſt any thing of <hi>his diſtinguiſhing grace.</hi> Thus men may <hi>pray, preach,</hi> &amp;c. It is true, ſome have more ability unto theſe acts than others, and ſome Chriſtians at ſome times may find more ſtrength and ability, than at other times: but this dependeth not upon any influence of <hi>ſpecial ſtrengthening grace;</hi> but upon the <hi>different tempers, and complexions of perſons,</hi> upon their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent meaſures of knowledg and gifts, and parts; and their ſtrength as to theſe acts, riſeth and falleth, as their gifts and parts increaſe, hold, or decay.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But thirdly, there are duties, that are <hi>more internal;</hi> ſuch as <hi>meditating of God, delighting, believing</hi> in him, <hi>breathing after him, fervency of Spirit,</hi> in his ſervice, the right manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all external acts. Now to the performance of this, there needeth <hi>a ſpecial influence in the Spirit of God;</hi> beſides all the advantage, which any man can have from natural parts, or gifts. And the experience of every Chriſtian juſtifieth, that God
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:192227:396"/>uſeth a great variety in his diſpenſings of it: ſome Chriſtians find much more than others do; others find much more at one time, than at an other, both for the performing the <hi>acts of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,</hi> and of <hi>Vivification;</hi> the practice of <hi>dying to ſin,</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to righteouſneſs;</hi> and alſo for the bearing any burthens, which God in his Providence layeth upon him, and going through any ſufferings, which God hath laid out for him: and theſe gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al withdrawings of theſe Divine aſſiſtances, are what we call <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine deſertions,</hi> as to theſe manifeſtations of grace. Now my next buſineſs muſt be, to ſhew you the wiſdom and reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the motions of Divine Providence, in the inequality of theſe diſpenſations, which ſometimes proves matter of great trouble to Gods People.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the differences of <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>ability,</hi> to the <hi>more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts of our homage to God;</hi> it is not ſo properly within my ſubject to be diſcourſed: I ſhall therefore ſpeak but ſhortly to it: ſomething I am willing to ſpeak, becauſe I fear too many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians miſtake this for <hi>ſtrengthning grace.</hi> This difference ariſeth, 1. from <hi>a difference,</hi> or <hi>decay</hi> in <hi>knowledg,</hi> and other <hi>parts,</hi> and <hi>common gifts. Knowledg</hi> of the things of God, is the foundation of this practice, and it cannot be expected that Chriſtians weak in knowledg, ſhould be able to expreſs themſelves ſo freely in <hi>prayer,</hi> or in <hi>Spiritual conference,</hi> or <hi>any other exerciſe,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon <hi>knowledg,</hi> as the more <hi>knowing Chriſtian can.</hi> 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, As difference as to degrees of knowledg is one cauſe, ſo <hi>different frequency in Practice,</hi> is an other: a man in practical things is perfected by <hi>practice.</hi> As he that never almoſt writeth, will forget his hand; and he that uſeth not himſelf to <hi>read,</hi> or <hi>ſpeak Latine,</hi> or any other Language, will in a ſhort time loſe the very ability, he once had to do it: ſo it is but a reaſonable thing for us to imagine, that he who ſeldom or never prayeth, ſhould loſe his <hi>gift, and ability to pray;</hi> and he who ſeldom, or <hi>never Preacheth,</hi> ſhould loſe his gift, and ability to Preach. We find by experience, and may find it, whenever we try it, that a man, that hath an excellent ability to pray, neglecting that gift, in a ſhort time will loſe his gift, and not be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Ten lines of ſence without a Book. To this may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that theſe performances do alſo depend upon other natural, and common gifts, which if they fail through age, or other infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; it cannot without a Miracle be expected, but that this
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:192227:396"/>ſtrength and ability, ſhould abate alſo: I know alſo that God may blaſt theſe gifts, and oft doth for mens ſins, their neglect of the uſe of them, their not glorifying of God with them; but Gods uſual way of doing this, is, either by permitting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of theſe gifts upon which theſe exerciſes depend, or leaving the Hypocrite to fall into ſuch a ſenſleſneſs, and ſottiſhneſs in life, as quite takes him off from any regard of theſe pieces of homage unto God: but thus much ſhall ſerve to have ſpoken to theſe varieties and decays of <hi>ſtrength in the inward man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the other which are the <hi>influxes</hi> of <hi>Divine, and ſpecial grace,</hi> it is certainly reaſonable that God ſhould not diſpenſe equal meaſures to all, if we conſider; 1. <hi>That all are not of a alike groweth, and ſtanding in the Church.</hi> There is nothing more ordinary in Scripture than to compare the Church, to a <hi>Fold</hi> of Sheep, to a <hi>Family, &amp;c.</hi> Now there is no Fold, where all are are grown Sheep alike; ſcarce any Family, where are not ſome Infants, or young Children. <hi>Chriſt muſt carry the Lambs in his Arm,</hi> while he feedeth his <hi>Flock like a Shepheard.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaking of Chriſtians diſtinguiſheth betwixt <hi>Babes,</hi> and grown Perſons; betwixt thoſe that are <hi>perfect,</hi> and ſuch as are not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> ſuch as are <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>Carnal;</hi> ſuch as are fit for ſtrong Meat, and ſuch as have need of Milk: now although it be true, that this <hi>influx of Grace is from the Spirit of God;</hi> yet, the Spirit of God ordinarly worketh, <hi>Secundum quod nactus eſt Organon,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſubject it worketh in; and by our own Spiritual actions we are prepared for the receptions of theſe Spiritual ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, which are not the influxes of the firſt grace, but of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace, and diſtributed to Souls which have their <hi>ſenſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed to diſcern good and evil:</hi> ſhould God grant out equal mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this grace unto all, there could be no ſuch thing as <hi>groweth in grace;</hi> no ſuch perſons as <hi>Babes in grace,</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of grace, would be like that of glory, in which there is no Infant of days, nor old men of years: and indeed this were enough to have ſpoken to this caſe, if God did equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe out Spiritual ſtrength to thoſe who are of equal ſtanding in the ways of God; for though God will give Heaven at laſt (which anſwereth the Penny in the Parable) to him, who comes into the Lords Vineyard at the <hi>Eleventh hour;</hi> yet, he doth not give equal degrees of <hi>peace and ſtrength,</hi> to thoſe that come in to his Vineyard, and work there but one hour, with thoſe
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:192227:397"/>who have wrought all the heat of the day. Grace ſtrengthens by exerciſe, as habits are <hi>ſtrengthened, and confirmed by frequent acts:</hi> But yet, this is not enough to ſay in this caſe; for all thoſe that be of equal years, and ſtanding in the ways of God, are not of an <hi>equal faith,</hi> nor have an <hi>equal zeal,</hi> fervency, and <hi>intenſion of affections:</hi> Nay often Chriſtians of a much younger ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, find more Spiritual ſtrength to <hi>mortifie their corruptions,</hi> and perform <hi>Spiritual duties,</hi> than thoſe who have been of many years ſtanding in the ways of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Therefore <hi>God doubtleſs doth it many times to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſin, and guilt in his own People;</hi> either in the neglect of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and duty, or ſome other <hi>moral miſcarriages.</hi> Sin dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly infeebleth a Chriſtians Soul.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>As it Naturally deadneth the heart, towards God,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth its exerciſes upon him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As it provoketh God to withdraw himſelf.</hi> Sin is the averſion of the Soul from God, and its Converſion and turning to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of the Creature; hence it is impoſſible that the Soul that delighteth in ſin, ſhould equally breath after, and delight in God, as that Soul that hateth ſin, and is more perfectly turned from it. Sin quencheth the Holy fire in the Soul, it alſo diſcourageth the Soul from its confidence in God, and in its addreſſes to God; it makes the conſcience fly in a mans face, and repeat to him the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>What haſt thou to do, to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my Covenant in thy mouth, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou hateſt inſtruction, and caſteſt my law behind thee?</hi> Or in the Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>What fellowſhip, hath light with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? God with Belial? Righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs?</hi> Sin enfeebleth the Soul in all its addreſſes to God, and diſcourageth it in all it exerciſes. And 2. <hi>It provoketh God: your iniquities have ſeparated betwixt God and you,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>and your ſins have made him to hide his face from you.</hi> It was ſaid by a great Commander of Souldiers, <hi>That he was never afraid to dye, but when his conſcience ſmote him for ſome guilt of ſin;</hi> when the conſcience of a Chriſtian reflecteth guilt upon him, he is diſcouraged from exerciſing any faith, and confidence in God, and aſhamed in the duty of prayer to go unto God. There is no Chriſtian, but findeth this in his own experience, that the conſcience of ſin doth wonderfully prejudice his Holy boldneſs, in his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches to the Throne of Grace; <hi>How weak is thine heart, ſaith the Lord God, ſeeing thou doeſt all theſe things, the work of an imperious
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:192227:397"/>whoriſh Woman, Ezek.</hi> 16.30. It is indeed a <hi>weakneſs</hi> to ſin, and weakneſs to any Spiritual acting, is the firſt fruit of ſin in the Soul; for what are the Souls exerciſes upon God, but <hi>Holy Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Faith, Hope, Spiritual deſires, delight, a fervency, zeal, or heat of the whole Soul in Gods ſervice?</hi> Now ſin rendring the Soul guilty, and defiled; how is it poſſible, it ſhould <hi>delight in,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire communion with an Holy God, exerciſe any ſtrong <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> in <hi>that God,</hi> who hath declared his wrath againſt ſinners; or care to draw near to God, when it apprehendeth God look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it afar off, with an angry countenance? This is another thing, which maketh this motion of Divine Providence reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that God by it may puniſh the failings, errors, and miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of People.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly. It appeareth reaſonable upon the <hi>Conſideration of the great differences of Chriſtians in their practiſe of Godlineſs.</hi> The promiſes of <hi>ſtrength</hi> are made to thoſe that <hi>wait upon the Lord for it.</hi> Pſal. 27.14. <hi>wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart; wait</hi> I <hi>ſay on the Lord.</hi> Iſa. 40.31. <hi>They that wait upon the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength; they ſhall mount up with wings like the Eagles; they ſhall run, and not be weary;</hi> and <hi>they ſhall walk and not faint.</hi> Now it is true every Child of God waiteth upon the Lord; but every one <hi>waiteth not alike,</hi> nor walketh with God to the ſame degree. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will tell every Chriſtian, that the more ſtrictly, and cloſely, and conſtantly he walketh with God, the ſtronger he groweth in all Duty. Infuſed habits are advantaged by exerciſe, as the fire that kindled the wood for ſacrifices upon the Altar, firſt came down from Heaven; but then was to be kept alive by the care and labour of the <hi>Prieſts;</hi> ſo habits of <hi>Spiritual Grace,</hi> are indeed <hi>infuſed from God,</hi> yea and muſt alſo be mantained by daily influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from God, yet with a concurrence alſo of our own labour, in waiting upon God and exerciſing our ſelves unto Godlineſs; and the more a Chriſtian doth ſo exerciſe himſelf, the more ſtrong he ſhall grow, <hi>Job.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The righteous ſhall hold on in his way, and he that hath clean hands, ſhall add ſtrength,</hi> or, (as our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reads it) <hi>grow ſtronger, and ſtronger.</hi> The more a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth in <hi>acts of Righteouſneſs,</hi> the more he <hi>groweth in Spiritual ſtrength;</hi> ordinarily therefore, men, and women, which have <hi>moſt communion with God</hi> and <hi>walk more cloſely with him,</hi> have <hi>moſt ſtrength to Spiritual Duties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="704" facs="tcp:192227:398"/>5. Chriſtians differences in <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and <hi>Experiences of God,</hi> is one great reaſon of their <hi>differences, as to Spiritual ſtrength.</hi> 1. Their difference in <hi>Knowledge:</hi> our <hi>external acts of Piety</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Prayer</hi>) as to the <hi>true, and excellent performance of them,</hi> do depend upon our <hi>internal motions</hi> towards God: as is our <hi>Faith,</hi> our <hi>Love,</hi> our <hi>Hope,</hi> ſo will our fervency in <hi>Spirit,</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>exerciſes of our Faith or hope,</hi> or any other grace be; for thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward habits are the principles from which our actions flow, the <hi>powers</hi> which in action we exert, and put forth. Now theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workings of our Souls do very much depend upon our <hi>knowledge;</hi> It is true they are not the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>neceſſary fruits, or conſequents</hi> of <hi>knowledge. Knowledge</hi> muſt be ſanctified before it will produce any ſuch <hi>effects;</hi> many a one hath a large know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>God,</hi> of the holy Scriptures, and whatſoever they reveal of God, to render him to the Soul a fit object to be <hi>believed,</hi> and <hi>truſted in, loved, deſired, delighted in.</hi> But this is certain that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>knowledge</hi> there can be no ſuch <hi>Exerciſes.</hi> No man who is wholly ignorant of God, and the Scriptures, can breath after him, delight in him, hope in his mercy, truſt in his promiſes. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some <hi>knowledge</hi> is neceſſary to the working of any of theſe habits, and the motions of theſe habits, will be proportionable to the degrees of Chriſtian knowledge; Hence you ſhall obſerve that Chriſtians who are <hi>weak in knowledge,</hi> are always <hi>weak in faith, weak in an hour</hi> of <hi>Temptation, indeed</hi> weak as to the <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of all Spiritual gracious habits.</hi> Now that there is a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Chriſtians knowledge, and underſtanding of the holy Scriptures, is a thing of evident demonſtration. 2. Secondly as there is a great Difference in Chriſtians, as to their <hi>intellectuals,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intelligence from which our wills, and <hi>Affections</hi> move; ſo there is yet a <hi>greater difference</hi> in their <hi>Experiences</hi> of God. The Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. That <hi>tribulation worketh patience, and patience, experience;</hi> and <hi>experience hope.</hi> Experience is a mighty advantage to divers exerciſes of grace, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>faith, and hope.</hi> 1 Sam. 17. <hi>David</hi> telleth <hi>Saul,</hi> wondering that he being ſo young a ſtripling, ſhould dare to encounter <hi>Goliah:</hi> That he had <hi>kept his Fathers ſheep, and there came out a Lion and a Bear, and took a Lamb out of the flock.</hi> v. 36. Thy <hi>Servant ſlew both the Lion and the Bear, this uncircumciſed Philiſtine ſhall be like one of them:</hi> his experience of Gods protecting him from the <hi>Lion</hi> and the <hi>Bear,</hi> begot in him a confidence in God, that he would alſo deliver
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:192227:398"/>him from the Philiſtine: thus <hi>Paul</hi> with the ſame breath, with which he ſaid, <hi>God had delivered,</hi> ſaith alſo <hi>and ſhall deliver;</hi> now that Chriſtians of more experiences, ſhould have more ſtrength and confidence, is but the natural working of mans Soul.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> God doth often by the withdrawings of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his Grace, <hi>puniſh too great adventurouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of our own ſtrength</hi> (this falleth properly under the third head, but being forgot there, I ſhall add it here.) This I take to have been the Caſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> when Chriſt told his Diſciples they ſhould all forſake him; <hi>Peter</hi> tells him, that <hi>if he died with him he would not deny him.</hi> He adventureth into the <hi>High-Prieſts Hall</hi> after his Maſter, and proves not ſtrong enough, to reſiſt the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Silly Damoſel, Charging him to have been one of Chriſts Diſciples. God often puniſheth thus mens leading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Temptation, adventuring upon precipices, when he hath commanded them to abſtain from all appearances of Evil, and to <hi>give no advantage to the Adverſary.</hi> It is ſaid that <hi>God will teach the humble,</hi> and that he will <hi>give grace to the humble,</hi> whiles <hi>he reſiſteth</hi> and <hi>ſets himſelf in Oppoſition to the proud.</hi> Much more might be ſaid, to juſtifie the wiſdom and reaſonableneſs of the motions of Divine Providence in not giving equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>ſtrengthening grace,</hi> to thoſe who are his own people. Before I come to the Application of this diſcourſe, I ſhall ſpeak to the two other Queſtions relating to <hi>Quickening,</hi> and <hi>Conſolatory grace;</hi> becauſe almoſt the ſame things will juſtifie the wiſdome of God, in them, and the ſame Application will fit them all.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Whence is it that all have not the like meaſures of Quickening Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a 3 fold <hi>Quickening</hi> of which you read in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 1. The <hi>Quickening</hi> of a <hi>dead body. That which thou ſoweſt</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is not Quickened except it die.</hi> 2. <hi>There is the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of Souls dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> Eph. 2.1. Neither of theſe is that which I here intend. 3. There is a <hi>Quickening,</hi> which is but the adding of <hi>further life and vigour,</hi> to a living <hi>Soul.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> prays the Lord, <hi>Quicken me in thy way;</hi> that man or woman that is not <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> may yet la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under a <hi>great dulneſs and deadneſs,</hi> to the <hi>Operations of a
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:192227:399"/>Spiritual life;</hi> nor is there any thing more evident than that as to this, there is a great variety amongſt Chriſtians, yea in the Spirit of the ſame <hi>Chriſtian</hi> at different times: the Souls of good people often find another kind of freedome, and livelyneſs in Spiritual duties, than they do at other times: now whence this is, is a queſtion not unworthy to be anſwered, the ſweetneſs of a Chriſtians life very much depending upon it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To which I muſt anſwer, (as to the other) that this alſo is often cauſed from the <hi>temperature,</hi> or from the <hi>diſtemper of the body,</hi> and that more generally than either of the other before mentioned; for though there be nothing more true, than that a Chriſtian of an healthy temper and conſtitution, may yet complain of this ſpiritual <hi>diſtemper,</hi> and find his heart <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>dull</hi> enough to ſpiritual things; yet it is rare for a Chriſtian under bodily diſtemperatures, eſpecially ſuch as affect the <hi>head,</hi> or any of the <hi>vital parts,</hi> to find himſelf as at other times, as to his duties, eſpecially ſome duties of communion with God. There is ſuch a cloſe relation of our <hi>ſouls</hi> to our <hi>bodies,</hi> that their diſtemperatures do mutually affect each other: the <hi>diſtemperatures of the mind,</hi> either through <hi>immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> fear, or ſorrow, do often very much <hi>affect the body;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the <hi>diſtemperatures of the body,</hi> do often very much <hi>affect the mind;</hi> and this <hi>dulneſs, ineptitude</hi> to, and <hi>heavineſs</hi> in its Religious performances, is one of the <hi>firſt evils</hi> with which the <hi>ſoul</hi> is ſo affected: and indeed this makes one of the greateſt difficulties which the ſpiritual Phyſician meeteth with, to make up a true judgment, <hi>whether the diſorder and diſtemperature which he meeteth with oft-times in diſturbed ſouls, be originally in the mind, or only there reflexively</hi> by a <hi>ſympathy</hi> with a <hi>diſtempered body,</hi> for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly applications muſt differ: and where this <hi>dulneſs,</hi> and <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs</hi> is an <hi>effect</hi> of a bodily diſeaſe, it very often removeth with the cure of that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it is not ſo always. The <hi>guilt of ſin,</hi> hath alſo a great <hi>cauſation here:</hi> For it is neither reaſonable to imagine, nor indeed poſſible to be, that a ſoul burdened in its Conſcience with the load and guilt of ſin, ſhould <hi>run the ways of Gods Commandments,</hi> as chearfully, and as faſt as that ſoul, who through grace hath been inabled to caſt this burthen upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and comfortably, at leaſt, to hope, that its iniquities are forgiven, and
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:192227:399"/>its ſins covered; much leſs, as that ſoul who walketh in the more clear Viſion of God, and under the full aſſurance of the pardon of its ſins, and its acceptation with God. A ſoul continually pull'd back by Conſcience, and told, that it is a <hi>guilty perſon</hi> whom God accepteth not, cannot poſſibly make <hi>ſuch haſte without delayings,</hi> as another ſoul to keep Gods Commandments. The guilty ſoul therefore, is but an heavy moving Soul in Spiritual performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Nay, thirdly, The <hi>tempted, the deſerted Soul,</hi> though its <hi>temptations,</hi> or <hi>deſertions, be not the puniſhment of Sin, but only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batory of grace, cannot be ſo free,</hi> and <hi>lively,</hi> as <hi>another Soul:</hi> and if it be but a juſt and reaſonable motion of Providence, to let <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> ſometimes <hi>ſtand at a Chriſtians right hand,</hi> and be continually <hi>buffeting it</hi> for a ſeaſon, and to withdraw from ſome Soul, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of <hi>ſtrengthning,</hi> and <hi>conſolatory grace;</hi> It cannot be unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to leave it under ſome <hi>Spiritual deadneſs and dulneſs,</hi> which are but the proper conſequents, and effects of the other: how can any one imagine that a Soul continually <hi>moved</hi> to ſome ſinful actions, and poſſibly ſo violently moved, as the Soul know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how to deny the motion, ſhould find as much freedom, and chearfulneſs in the ſervice of God, as a Soul under no ſuch incumbrance; or that a Soul, under doubts, and fears, and jealouſies of Gods favour to it, and its acceptance with God, ſhould at the ſame time enjoy the like freedom in the ſervice of God, and unto Spiritual duty, as that Soul which walketh (as at Noon-day) in the full, and brighteſt light of Gods countenance, and under the fulleſt confirmations of the love of God unto it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, The <hi>freedom,</hi> and <hi>livelineſs</hi> of a Soul, to, and in <hi>Spiritual duty,</hi> doth alſo much depend upon its <hi>freedom,</hi> from <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements,</hi> and <hi>buſineſſes</hi> of an <hi>Heterogeneous Nature.</hi> 1. The Soul of a man hath not an infiniteneſs in its powers; if they be eagerly working, and buſily exerciſed this way, they cannot be as eagerly, and buſily exerciſed another way, which is quite of another nature. Chriſt hath told us, that <hi>no man can ſerve two Maſters.</hi> No man can ſerve <hi>God and Mammon,</hi> That is, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, and intenſly ſerve both; he will ſerve the one, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or deſpiſe the other: you never knew one deeply inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and intangled in worldly concerns, <hi>freely, lively,</hi> and <hi>active</hi> in the ſervice of God; buſineſſes, and cares of the World are
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:192227:400"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                     <pb n="708" facs="tcp:192227:401"/>like thick clay, which clog the Chariot-Wheels of the Soul and keep it from moving nimbly. The Soul then acteth moſt lively and freely, when it is moſt ſequeſtred from <hi>the World,</hi> and the concerns of it. Souls in <hi>ſeparation</hi> ſerve God with the greateſt <hi>freedom, alacrity, and chearfulneſs,</hi> as well becauſe in that ſtate they are freed from the cares, and buſineſſes of the World, as from the impediment of the Body, by whoſe <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> they act, while they continue in a ſtate of conjunction with it. Theſe now are ſome of the chief cauſes of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Souls as to this freedom, and livelineſs, in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; now God giving theſe influences of grace alſo in the way, and uſe of means, and diſpenſing his grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the circumſtances of the Soul receiving it (I mean his diſpenſations of further grace, and manifeſtations of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the Souls of thoſe who are his own People) while there are in the World, Souls under ſuch different circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as according to an order of Nature and reaſon, they cannot be ſo free, and lively as others in their Spiritual operations; Gods inequal diſtribution of theſe diſpenſations, muſt needs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear exceeding juſt and reaſonable: and thus much may ſerve to have ſpoken as to theſe. I proceed to a Fourth <hi>Queſtion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Queſt. <hi>Whence is the variety of Gods diſpenſations of conſolatory grace? Conſolatory grace</hi> is that <hi>diſpenſation of Grace,</hi> by which the Souls of ſuch as fear God, are filled with <hi>joy,</hi> and peace: The Pſalmiſt telleth us, That <hi>light is ſown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart:</hi> Every child of God hath a <hi>right to</hi> a <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> for joy and peace in the heart, and conſcience, is but the <hi>Copy</hi> of a <hi>peace</hi> with God. Now every Child of God, hath <hi>peace with God.</hi> For that is the immediate product of juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God.</hi> But a <hi>jus ad rem, a right to peace,</hi> is one thing, that every Believer hath; a <hi>jus in re,</hi> or an actual poſſeſſion of this joy, and peace is another thing. The light that is ſown for them, doth not always ſhine; the <hi>peace</hi> that is for them in the <hi>Fountain,</hi> is not always in their Souls <hi>as a River,</hi> making glad their hearts. Chriſt hath left them <hi>Peace</hi> as a Legacy, <hi>John</hi> 14.27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you;</hi> but as <hi>Legacies,</hi> are ordinarily left to be paid at different times, and oft-times upon certain conditions, which
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:192227:401"/>not being performed, the payment of the Legacy is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, or deferred: So it is as to this Legacy.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing more certain, than that conſolations of the Soul, are the influences of the Spirit of God, for he is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account called the <hi>Comforter;</hi> and they are the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes</hi> of <hi>ſpecial grace,</hi> for <hi>there is no peace to the wicked</hi> (ſaith my God;) it is but an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> or a falſe fire, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>flaſheth in the face of an Hypocrite.</hi> For all peace of Conſcience, being (as I ſaid before) but a <hi>Tranſcript</hi> in our Conſciences of the peace our Souls have ratified with God, and confirmed in the Heavens; a Soul whoſe iniquities are not forgiven, is not <hi>ſubjectum capax,</hi> a ſubject capable of this inward joy and peace, which is conſequent to believing, and although not inſeparable from it, yet never but ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to it. It is our unhappineſs to live in times, when all the influxes of <hi>ſpecial grace are denied by ſome;</hi> ſo that it is no wonder, if ſome make a mock of theſe <hi>Divine conſolations,</hi> and will allow no other Operations, to relieve ſad, and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Souls, than concluſions from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> either working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Natural, or <hi>revealed Principles;</hi> taking no notice of the Spirit of Gods influence, 1. <hi>Either to inable the Soul, to make ſuch Applications, and concluſions from true Premiſes;</hi> Or 2. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>elevate, and raiſe up the Soul, beyond the force of theſe Principles.</hi> But be their Sentiments what they will, and their Diſcourſes ſutable to their Principles as they will; we know that the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> is not for nothing: called a Comforter. That we Read of the <hi>Conſolations of God, Job</hi> 15.11. And that God is called, <hi>The God of Conſolation,</hi> and he that <hi>hath given us everlaſting Conſolation:</hi> That, in the midſt of <hi>Davids</hi> perplexing thoughts, they were Gods <hi>comforts,</hi> which <hi>refreſhed his Soul, Pſalm</hi> 94. <hi>v.</hi> 19. That it is God, who <hi>comforteth thoſe that are caſt down,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.6. <hi>And who comforteth us in all tribulation,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.4.</p>
                  <p>But it is as certain, that the <hi>conſolations of all Souls,</hi> even thoſe who are true Believers, are not equal; nay, the ſame believing Souls are not always under the ſame conſolato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry influences of <hi>Divine grace. David</hi> himſelf crieth out, why art thou caſt down, <hi>O my Soul? Why art thou ſo diſquieted</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me? the inſtances of <hi>Job, Heman, Aſaph, David,</hi> ſtands
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:192227:402"/>upon a Scriptural Record; but if we had not them, the experiences which we have every day of believing Souls (if we can make any Judgment of Believers) do ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this to our Souls: my buſineſs is to inquire the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and the reaſonableneſs of the motions of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the inequality of this diſtribution. This will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you upon three <hi>hypotheſes,</hi> which I take to be all very true.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That God doth ordinarily diſpenſe out theſe influences of grace, to ſouls which by his Providence he hath prepared for them.</hi> This which I call Gods Providential preparation of ſouls, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of theſe influences, I conceive lies chiefly in Two things; 1. The <hi>freedom of it from thoſe bodily incumbrances, which in a natural working make the ſoul ſad, heavy and dejected:</hi> ſuch diſtempers we know there are, as in a natural working ſadden the ſpirit, and fill it full of fear, ſorrow, dejection, and deſpondency, which are all contrary to the comforts and ſerenity of a ſoul; and, as I have once and again told you, it muſt be a miraculous operation, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the bias, tendency and natural operations of a man, for a ſoul to be filled with conſolations, while it is influenced with a body lying under theſe diſadvantages: God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he intendeth any of theſe conſolatory influences, doth ordinarily prepare the ſoul for it, by delivering it from thoſe influences of an ill affected body, which diſpoſe it quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond way, by which God prepareth the ſoul for it, is by <hi>filling it with knowledg proportionable to it;</hi> for the <hi>comforts</hi> of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul are not irrational and unaccountable things, but the reſults of <hi>Scriptural concluſions,</hi> which the ſoul is by the <hi>Comforter</hi> inabled to make. God hath in his Word ſown the ſeed of light and joy for them; the Miniſters of the Goſpel (who are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of Scripture) have an Office and Miniſtery in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this Word, and working the ſouls of Gods people to underſtand the ſenſe of them. The ſoul it ſelf hath an action in it uſing its reaſon and natural powers to conclude from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Holy Spirit giveth unto the ſoul to ſee the things <hi>which are freely given it of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. and further poſſibly, ſetteth to its Seal, and giveth it a further and more undoubted confirmation; ſo as in an ordinary working, the <hi>comforted ſoul</hi> muſt be a knowing and underſtanding ſoul: It is true, we ſometimes find ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:192227:402"/>ſouls full of joy and peace, whoſe knowledg doth not appear proportionable; God ſo relieving ſome particular ſouls, after their lying under the diſcouragements of the ſpirit of bondage: But commonly ſuch comforts are not of long continuance, rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reliefs to the ſoul from an extraordinary working of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Comforter, than any ſettled conſolation, and the abidings of the Comforter with them. Seldom any but knowing and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtians, have a ſettled and continued joy and peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their believing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, That <hi>God doth ordinarily give out theſe diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more or leſs, or nothing of them; though, not according to the merits of thoſe ſouls that have them, yet according to their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and miſbehaviour towards him:</hi> That famous promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 14.21. <hi>We will manifeſt our ſelves unto him,</hi> is made to thoſe that love Chriſt, and <hi>who keep his Commandments:</hi> And when <hi>Judas</hi> asks him, <hi>Lord! How is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf to us, and not unto the world;</hi> Chriſt, anſwereth him, ſaying, ver. 23. <hi>If any man love me and keepeth my ſayings, my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him: He that loveth me not, keepeth not my ſayings,</hi> as much as to ſay, The reaſon why I manifeſt my ſelf more to you, is becauſe you love me, and demonſtrate that love to me, by <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Commandments:</hi> For <hi>the world they love me not,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim that they love me not, by their diſobedience to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; and therefore it is, that I do not manifeſt my ſelf to the world, as I do unto you. In the receiving of the firſt grace, <hi>man is meerly paſſive,</hi> and the ſubject of preventing and operating grace; but as to the receptions of further grace, the child of God is <hi>active,</hi> and the ſubject of <hi>cooperative, adjuvant, and aſſiſting grace,</hi> and God gives out his aſſiſtances according to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, The reaſonableneſs of this different diſpenſation may appear in this: <hi>That in the diſpenſations</hi> of this <hi>grace,</hi> God acteth often by <hi>Prerogative, ſhewing mercy where he will ſhew mercy.</hi> Indeed he doth ſo as to the <hi>firſt grace,</hi> as I have before at large ſhewed you: But now he doth not ſo as to theſe influences of grace, which are neceſſary to the upholding of the myſtical union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Soul, and the upholding of a Chriſtians ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life; if he did, it were poſſible that a child of God might
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:192227:403"/>fall away from his ſtate of grace, and there might be an interciſion of the ſtate of Juſtification: But Chriſt hath told us, <hi>That if any man drink of the water which he ſhall give him, he ſhall never thirſt, but it ſhall be in him a well-ſpring of living water, ſpringing up in his ſoul to eternal life,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that in the diſpenſation of that, God acteth upon a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and as a <hi>debtor to his promiſe.</hi> If any one ſaith, God hath alſo promiſed <hi>to manifeſt himſelf unto his people:</hi> I anſwer, thoſe promiſes are made to thoſe <hi>that love him and keep his Commandments;</hi> but for the upholding of the ſpiritual life, <hi>he hath made a Covenant with his people,</hi> as that he will <hi>never depart from them to do them good;</hi> ſo that <hi>he will put his fear into their hearts, that they ſhall never depart from him:</hi> which promiſe, although it be not to be extended to a being kept from all ſin, yet it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the preſervation of ſouls from ſuch degrees of ſinning, as ſhall extend to the alteration of the ſtate of the ſoul, and the extinguiſhing the <hi>ſpiritual life,</hi> and killing the ſeed of God in the ſoul. But for thoſe manifeſtations of grace, which are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a ſouls Salvation, and the upholding of ſpiritual life; in it God acteth more freely according to the counſel of his own Will, derected by his own infinite Wiſdom. Now upon theſe Hypotheſes, ſuppoſing that all Chriſtians are not of equal degrees of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> nor are equal as to their bodily circumſtances; that every ſoul that belongeth to God, doth not walk up to an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of duty; but ſome may be, and are guilty, of more, and more eminent failings than others: Or that God may be by his infinite Wiſdom directed, to <hi>try</hi> one ſoul more than another, to prove their patience, or their <hi>faith,</hi> which is moſt tryed; when his people have leaſt ſenſible conſolations; the motions of Divine Providence, in diſtributing to ſeveral Chriſtians, nay, to the ſame Chriſtians, ſeveral degrees of conſolatory influences of grace, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſeem either unjuſt, or unreaſonable to any ſober and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Chriſtians. This is all I ſhall ſpeak to this Queſtion, I proceed to the Fifth Queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Queſt. <hi>Whence it is, that there are ſuch manifeſt differences in Chriſtian growth in grace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>growth in ſpiritual gifts,</hi> and a <hi>growth in gracious habits,</hi> and theſe muſt be carefully diſtinguiſhed; for from a want of a juſt diſtinguiſhing theſe, many doubts and miſtakes ariſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this point of <hi>growing in grace;</hi> there may be <hi>the one,</hi> and a
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:192227:403"/>
                     <hi>great increaſe</hi> and growth in them, where there is nothing either of the beginnings or <hi>increaſe</hi> of <hi>the other.</hi> By <hi>ſpiritual gifts,</hi> I <hi>underſtand</hi> thoſe <hi>powers</hi> by which <hi>perſons</hi> are inabled to ſome <hi>more external ſpiritual operations.</hi> You read much of them in the Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Theſe are uſually diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> ſuch were the <hi>gifts of Tongues, Prophecy, Healing, Interpretation, &amp;c.</hi> Which God was pleaſed to deal out in the <hi>Infancy</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> both to ſupply the want they had of <hi>ordinary means,</hi> and alſo to give a <hi>reputation</hi> to, and <hi>to confirm the Doctrine of the Goſpel.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> having got a larger <hi>footing</hi> and <hi>acceptance</hi> in the World, needed not theſe aids to its <hi>reputation,</hi> nor ſuch miraculous confirmations; theſe therefore ſoon ceaſed, and have rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if at all, been ſince given out. But there are <hi>other gifts</hi> that are more ordinary, and of conſtant and daily uſe in the <hi>Church of God;</hi> ſuch are the <hi>gift of Prayer,</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Conference, &amp;c.</hi> Now Chriſtians are capable of growth and increaſe in theſe.</p>
                  <p>But beſides theſe, there are <hi>gracious habits;</hi> which are <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>abilities</hi> in the <hi>ſoul,</hi> inabling it to <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>more ſecret and inward communion with God:</hi> Such as <hi>Faith, Love,</hi> and others. And theſe are capable of <hi>increaſe,</hi> if not in their number, yet in their <hi>degrees of intention:</hi> Hence the Apoſtles pray, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith.</hi> And this left room for the Apoſtle to pray for the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. <hi>That the Lord would increaſe their fruit of righteouſneſs;</hi> and for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that the Lord would <hi>make them to increaſe,</hi> and that they might increaſe more and more; 1 <hi>Theſſ,</hi> 3.12. 4.10. Thus you read of an <hi>increaſing with the increaſe of God; Col.</hi> 2.19. and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpering of the ſoul; 3 Ep. <hi>John</hi> v. 2. and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth thoſe to whom he writeth, to <hi>grow in grace, and in the knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This <hi>growing in grace,</hi> is not without the ſpecial influence of God: Thence it is that both the Apoſtles pray for it. Chriſt is both the Author and the Finiſher of our Faith. Now it is apparent that this growth in grace is not equal in all the ſouls of them who are the children of God; as we ſee in that which is born of the fleſh, ſome children grow faſter than others; ſo is it true as to thoſe that are born of God, <hi>born of the ſpirit,</hi> they all grow, but ſome grow much faſter than others grow; and the
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:192227:404"/>thriving and proſpering of their ſouls is much more evident to the world. In this alſo the actual providence of God hath its hand. Let me, before I ſhut up this Diſcourſe, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to give you an account of this, to ſhew the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of this motion of Divine Providence; and that in this the wayes of God are equal.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhall onely in this Caſe premiſe this: That there may be <hi>great miſtakes as to growth of grace.</hi> I ſhall inſtance in two: 1. <hi>Some may miſtake a growth and increaſing in ſpiritual gifts,</hi> or <hi>moral habits,</hi> for a <hi>growth in grace.</hi> A man may ſo miſtake himſelf, and his neighbours may ſo miſtake him. <hi>Spiritual gifts</hi> are gliſtering things, and often dazle our eyes. We hear men mightily improved in their abilities fitly to expreſs their own and others wants unto God in prayer, and to implead them with proper arguments. We hear a Miniſter improved in preaching, an ordinary Chriſtian improved in his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſpiritual things, and his utterance and ability to maintain a profitable diſcourſe; we are perfectly apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe perſons are <hi>grown in grace,</hi> and <hi>it may be ſo;</hi> but withal it may not be ſo too: for theſe are ſeparable from any thing of truly gracious habits, which are the in-dwellers in a regenerate and ſanctified heart. When the Apoſtle had been perſwading the Corinthians to covet the <hi>beſt gifts,</hi> he by and by telleth them, <hi>That he will ſhew them a more excellent way.</hi> What was that? The way of <hi>ſpecial diſtinguiſhing grace, love to God;</hi> without which he telleth them in the beginning of the next Chapter, that all <hi>gifts,</hi> all <hi>action,</hi> all <hi>ſuffering, prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſpeaking with tongues, knowledge of all myſteries, giving all his goods to the poor,</hi> and <hi>his body to be burned,</hi> would ſignifie nothing but a little noiſe in the world, and render him no more than as <hi>ſounding braſs</hi> and a <hi>tinkling cymbal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, As ſome may judge they are grown in grace, becauſe they are grown in gifts; ſo <hi>others may judge they are not grown in grace,</hi> when indeed they are. And the common mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake here, is mens calling nothing a <hi>growth in grace,</hi> but <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſion</hi> and <hi>intention of the Affections;</hi> when as the truth is, as we ſay concerning Women (the Apoſtle you know calls them <hi>the weaker Veſſels</hi>) yet they have the ſtrongeſt paſſions: So it is true concerning Chriſtians, thoſe that are the <hi>weakeſt Chriſtians</hi> have the ſtrongeſt Affections and Paſſions. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:192227:404"/>to this, it is ordinarily obſerved, That <hi>Chriſtians</hi> uſually in the beginning of their <hi>Converſion,</hi> have the <hi>ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Affections,</hi> the moſt paſſionate <hi>grief for ſin,</hi> the moſt unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied pantings and breathings after God and his Ordinances; but at this time weaker and leſs confirmed habits of Faith, of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and <hi>Mortification;</hi> and are more eaſily than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, turned aſide by a temptation. But theſe miſtakes being eaſily obviated, I eaſily grant it, That there are real differences, as to Chriſtians increaſe, progreſs, and growth in grace; of which I ſhall now come to give you a ſhort account:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I might tell you, <hi>That all growth ſuppoſeth time.</hi> It is a motion that is not in an inſtant. <hi>Adam</hi> was the onely man that God brought into the World at a perfect Age, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers you know come into the World little Children, and are perfected, and grow up by degrees; and as the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> was the onely man, who came into the World perfect as to natural parts and growth. So <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> was the onely man that at firſt appeared to the World perfect in grace; for in him the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt bodily.</hi> All others are firſt Babes, then ſtronger ones, and perfected by degrees. So long therefore as there is a ſucceſſive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and bringing of ſouls to God, there muſt be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the World of different ſizes and ſtatures, as to growth, and increaſe in grace. But yet this is not a perfect account of this variety, for all Chriſtians of the ſame ſtanding in the ways of God, are not of the ſame proficiency and ſtature in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, therefore, <hi>One great cauſe may be a difference in ſpiritual nouriſhment.</hi> Though it be true in Bodies, that all who are fed with the ſame bread, and drink the ſame drink, do not thrive alike; yet ſuppoſe a body to be fed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper food, or not to have half enough, it is no great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if it doth not grow ſo faſt as another body that hath a plenty of food, and that food too which is good and proper for it. It is the ſame caſe with the ſoul, that alſo muſt have <hi>its food.</hi> The ſouls food is the <hi>Scriptures, Ordinances, Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> For the firſt indeed we have them, we have them in our own language; ſo that we can underſtand them: but yet every one cannot <hi>read</hi> (an inexcuſable fault in Parents and
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:192227:405"/>ſuch as have the government of youth, eſpecially in the age wherein we live;) nor have all the like means of having them read to them, and being made to underſtand them. But the great difference lies in Ordinances; St. <hi>Peter</hi> adviſeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>to deſire</hi> like <hi>New-born Babes,</hi> the ſincere milk <hi>of the Word, that they might grow thereby.</hi> He (doubtleſs) ſpeaketh of the Word preached, the Promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.13. is, <hi>Thoſe that are planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the courts of our God.</hi> The Houſe of the Lord is the Church of the Lord, and there is a promiſe of growth to all thoſe that are planted in it; yet as in our Gardens and Fields, there are different ſorts oft-times; ſo in the Church of God (which is a large Field) there are different ſoils for Chriſtians: There is a great deal of difference in that preaching under which Chriſtians ſit, One man preacheth in the <hi>inticing words of mans wiſdom, another in the perſwaſive words of mans wiſdom;</hi> another in the evidence and <hi>demonſtration of the ſpirit and with power.</hi> Some Chriſtians poſſibly live, where they ſcarce ever hear a good Sermon, but ſome <hi>Harangues</hi> of <hi>Oratory,</hi> or ſome rational Philoſophical Diſcourſes, of which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand little or nothing: Others live under <hi>plain, lively, powerful</hi> preaching; where the Preacher makes it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſtudy the ſouls of his people, and proportioneth his preaching accordingly: ſo as the <hi>Babes have their milk</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their <hi>ſtronger meat.</hi> Teaching them as they are able to receive inſtruction. It is no wonder if ſuch Chriſtians who are under the beſt means, be found moſt thriving; God working in the uſe of means, where means can be had. It is true, Chriſt once (and never but once that we read of) <hi>made uſe of clay and ſpittle</hi> to cure the blind mans eyes. And when our Lord was himſelf upon the Earth, attending his own Garden, and the Plants in it, though he had a fulneſs of wiſdom and power too, and <hi>had many things to ſay unto them;</hi> yet ſaith he, <hi>John</hi> 16.12. <hi>you are not able to bear them now.</hi> And it is ſaid <hi>Mark</hi> 4.33. <hi>With many ſuch parables ſpake he the Word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</hi> Now if Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans live under preachers, who either make no conſcience what they preach unto people, but fill up their time either with idle Fables, or Invectives againſt Parties, or ſome flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid or Philoſophical Diſcourſes; as if their ſtudy were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:192227:405"/>contrary to that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> whoſe great care (as he tells us) was ſo to order his preaching, as the faith of his hearers might not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God: Now their preaching ſeems to be ſo directed and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as that the <hi>faith of their hearers</hi> might not reſt in the <hi>power of God,</hi> but <hi>in the wiſdom of men.</hi> It is no wonder if ſuch Chriſtians do not grow in grace in proportion with others, who live under more adequate and proper means. God u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not ordinarily to work miracles, and their ordinary ſpiritual food is not proportioned to any ſuch thing as the ſpiritual proficiency of thoſe that hear them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, A great reaſon of this difference lieth alſo in <hi>the differing natural tempers of Chriſtians.</hi> Amongſt other <hi>Metaphors</hi> by which the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> expreſſeth the <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi> of ſouls by, that of <hi>Engraffing</hi> is one; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17.19.23, 24. The ſoul is ingrafted into Chriſt. Now thoſe who are skilled in planting, know that according to the different nature of the plant, the growth is faſter or ſlower, more or leſs. Some plants grow much more freely than others; a <hi>Cion</hi> of one ſort of fruit, will ſhoot up as much in one year, as a Cion of another ſpecies will ſhoot in two or three years. Truly it is ſo in the Spiritual Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Chriſt is the Stock,</hi> into which we are all ingrafted; there is no fault there: but now the <hi>Cions</hi> that are ingrafted into Chriſt, are not all of the ſame nature and temper. And although <hi>Grace</hi> makes a great change and alteration, and doth much correct a natural temper; yet it doth not root out Nature, nor work the change in a moment; nor in all the ſame proportion of time. There are <hi>ſeveral tempers,</hi> which much hinder the appearance of <hi>growth in grace.</hi> Some are naturally of <hi>vain, airy, light ſpirits;</hi> ſome of <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>high ſpirits;</hi> ſome of <hi>froward, teachy, paſsionate, ſtubborn ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi> Others are naturally of more <hi>ſolid, ſerious tempers;</hi> of more <hi>low</hi> and <hi>humble;</hi> of more <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>pliable ſpirits:</hi> Now where it happens that there is a change wrought in ſome perſons of airy and light ſpirits, or ſuch as are proud and high, or froward, and paſſionate and ſtubborn, a progreſs and growth in habits and exerciſes of grace, will not be ſo ſoon evident and apparent, as in thoſe ſouls that are of ſweeter and more gentle and ductile ſpirits: Much grace will make
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:192227:406"/>but a little ſhow, where there is an ill natural temper and humor.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>An ill neighbourhood doth make a great deal of difference in the growth of grace.</hi> We ſee in Plants, an ill neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Plants doth much hinder growth. There is ſcarce any Plant will thrive much near an <hi>Aſh;</hi> the like might be obſerved of other Trees, which experience tells us are ill neighbours to Plants. Rake up Fire in Aſhes, if it keepeth alive it is all. It is ſo with Chriſtians that are ill-yoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that live in ill Families or Neighbourhoods. There is ſome Wood they call <hi>Quench-coal</hi> (Rotten Wood is moſtly ſo.)</p>
                  <p>The truth is, the company of all carnal worldly men, is of that nature; they are all <hi>Quench-coals</hi> to the <hi>life of Grace,</hi> and diſcourage that holy fire which the Spirit of God hath kindled in the ſouls of his people. If a Chriſtian be engaged in ſuch ſociety, whether neceſſarily, as in <hi>Conjugal relations,</hi> and indeed in moſt Domeſtick relations, or voluntarily: if ſuch a Chriſtian <hi>keeps his ſincerity,</hi> it will be well, it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be expected that the profiting of ſuch Chriſtians ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto all; or indeed that they ſhould grow in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto other Chriſtians, who are engaged in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; and are under the daily Inſtructions, Exhortations, Reproofs and Admonitions of others; who as Brethren take themſelves concerned to conſider them, and to provoke them unto love and good works. Yet it is obſervable that ſuch Chriſtians do grow by a kind of ſpiritual <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> as they ſay the fire is hotteſt in the coldeſt weather; ſo we often ſee, that there is a great warmth and zeal againſt ſin and for God, nouriſhed in thoſe ſouls, which have been moſt ſmothered and choaked with ill relations and company; which diſcovereth it ſelf, as ſoon as thoſe perſons are freed from thoſe intanglements and incumbrances; but while they are troubled with them, this growth is not ſo evident, nor do we conſtantly find Grace thriving under ſuch ill ſhadows; ſo prone are our corrupt natures to receive contrary impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: and nothing ſo much as converſe expoſing us to the reception of them. So that this is like an ill air to the Body, which often hindreth the growth of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, <hi>As the growth of the Body is hindred by ſome
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:192227:406"/>diſeaſes,</hi> the growth of a plant by ſome <hi>canker,</hi> or ſome ill winds, or by the check which it may have by the bitings of ſome beaſts. So may the growth of Grace in the Soul be much hindered: 1. By the <hi>prevailings of ſome particular cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</hi> 2. Or by the wounds which the <hi>Soul receiveth from ſome temptations.</hi> It is true, There are ſome ſickneſſes in which perſons ſhoot out, and by which they are rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged than hindered in their growth; but there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther habituated diſtempers which hinder the growth of young perſons. There is no prevailing corruption but giveth a check to a growth in Grace, though ſometimes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing of it, doth by accident, promote Grace in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; as it was with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Luſts do wonderfully hinder proficiency in Grace. To inſtance but in that one luſt of <hi>Earthly mindedneſs,</hi> Let but an earthly, covetous mind, prevail upon any, it is a wonderful thing to obſerve how it checks all ſpirtual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; it betrayeth a Chriſtian to ſo many practical errors, both of omiſſion and commiſſion, that his neighbour ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, and obſerving him, cannot but cry out in the words of the Apoſtle; <hi>How dwelleth the love of God in this man?</hi> Though they ſee much in him which diſpoſeth them to charitable thoughts, and makes them that they cannot but conclude he is one that <hi>feareth God,</hi> yet they know not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the actions of his life to what the Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the nature of grace. Yea, and <hi>long</hi> and <hi>violent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,</hi> do alſo much hinder the <hi>ſouls growth.</hi> They are like cold winds or the bitings of beaſts to the plants, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the growth of them; though they be not internal cauſes, yet they are external cauſes of the plants unthrifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So it is with <hi>long</hi> and <hi>violent temptations,</hi> they indeed do not work as internal cauſes (I mean ſuch temptations as are <hi>ab hoſte,</hi> from our grand adverſary) to hinder a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans growth; but they are great external cauſes, diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ſoul in almoſt all its exerciſes of Communion with God, and applications of it ſelf unto him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Any <hi>Deſertions,</hi> or <hi>with-drawings of divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, are great cauſes.</hi> There are few plants which grow much in the ſhade, ordinarily the <hi>influences of heaven,</hi> both of the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Rain,</hi> are neceſſary to the growth of the
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:192227:407"/>plants. I am ſure the influences of <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs,</hi> are neceſſary to the ſpiritual growth of a good Chriſtian; and if they be with-drawn, though the ſoul may live, yet during the with-holdings of them, it will not much grow or thrive. The ſoul will live during the with-drawing of them; for I have once and again told you, that the Lord never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth what of his ſpiritual influence upon the ſoul is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to uphold and maintain the ſpiritual union and life; but no ſoul flouriſheth and increaſeth much under ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation: it ſtandeth in the ſhadow, and wanteth thoſe beams, which are neceſſary to its bearing and bringing forth much fruit. Theſe now are the great cauſes of that variety which we diſcern in <hi>Chriſtians Growth;</hi> other cauſes might be aſſigned, but this is ſufficient, ſuppoſing God to have appointed the uſe of means, in order to a ſpiritual growth, and ordinarily to concurre with the uſe of thoſe means, to juſtifie Divine Providence, in not equally making every Soul to grow.</p>
                  <p>There is yet one Queſtion more, which indeed doth not properly concern this place, in which I am to diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Reaſonableneſs of Divine Providence,</hi> in the inequal diſtributions of ſpecial diſtinguiſhing Grace; yet I ſhall ſpeak ſomething too, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6th. Queſt. <hi>Whence it is that good People have ſuch different Apprehenſions of the Truth of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which makes the difficulty in the Apprehenſion of this, is: 1. Partly, Becauſe there is but <hi>one Truth, one Faith,</hi> as well as <hi>one God, one Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. Two contradictory Propoſitions cannot be true, nor can both proceed from the God of Truth; for the ſame Fountain doth not ſend forth <hi>bitter Water</hi> and <hi>ſweet.</hi> One and the ſame God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak different things; God is Truth, and every Truth is from God; no lie, no falſhood, cannot poſſibly be from God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Partly, Becauſe all the People of God have the ſame <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> which is called the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> dwelling in them, and are under the ſame Promiſe of this Holy Spirit, leading <hi>them into all truth,</hi> and the <hi>Annointings, teaching them all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="721" facs="tcp:192227:407"/>3. Again, They have all the ſame <hi>word of truth</hi> to guide them, and to examine and <hi>meaſure Propoſitions by;</hi> they have the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> and that is the Standard in the Market of Truth; the Touch-ſtone by which every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is to be tryed, the Scale in which every Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be weighed.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding this, There is nothing more obvious than that, even ſuch who (if we may judge any thing) do truly fear God, have ſtrangely different apprehenſions concerning Divine Truth, concerning the Sacraments, the uſe of the Law, the extent of the Death of Chriſt, the power of mans Will, the true notion of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the queſtion is, Whence this variety is, why God permitteth it, and how the motions of Divine Providence, in theſe things, may appear juſt and reaſonable? I ſhut out of this Diſcourſe, the different Apprehenſions of <hi>Carnal,</hi> wicked, and ungodly men, whoſe <hi>Creed</hi> is commonly dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their luſt; and their whole art and ſtudy is, becauſe they cannot allow the conforming of their hearts to Divine Truth, to endeavour to interpret the Word of God into a fenſe conſiſtent with their luſts; as alſo all ſuch as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh of, whom <hi>becauſe they received not the truth in the love of it, God gives up to ſtrong deluſions to believe a lie; that they may be damned becauſe they have had pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs:</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12. or becauſe as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>They have detained the truth of God in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> I ſay, for all theſe I ſhall ſhut them out of my Diſcourſe, and onely inquire whence ſuch as <hi>truly love</hi> and <hi>fear God,</hi> have ſuch different Apprehenſions; and wherein the motions of Divine Providence, in permitting of them, ſeem juſt and reaſonable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It firſt muſt be laid down for a Principle, <hi>That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God never doth nor can ſuffer any elect Soul to embrace and die in any belief of any Propoſition, by the belief of which its Salvation may be endangered.</hi> The Apoſtle telleth you of ſome that bring in <hi>damnable Hereſies.</hi> Every Deviation from any <hi>Doctrine of Truth is</hi> an <hi>Error;</hi> but an Error is one thing, a <hi>damnable Error</hi> is another thing. There hath been a great deal of ſtir about <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> what <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Errors</hi> are <hi>Fundamental;</hi> I ſhall not engage my ſelf in that Diſpute,
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:192227:408" rendition="simple:additions"/>but ſhall determine thoſe <hi>Fundamental Truths,</hi> the belief of, or aſſent and agreement unto which, is <hi>neceſſary, in order to ſuch exerciſes of Faith and Holineſs, without the exerciſe of which no man can be ſaved:</hi> And thoſe are <hi>Fundamental Errors,</hi> which a man cannot hold, and in the mean time exerciſe <hi>that Faith and Holineſs, without the exerciſe of which no man can be ſaved.</hi> As now, ſuppoſing that <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is neceſſary to Salvation; <hi>A denial of the God-head of Chriſt</hi> muſt needs be a fundamental Error: for <hi>Curſed is he that truſteth in Man, and maketh Fleſh his Arm:</hi> The true and living God alone can be the object of our <hi>Faith.</hi> Now I do not ſay but a Child of God may fall in with, and for a time embrace ſuch Errors. The Providence of God may permit him thus to fall, but it cannot, it doth not, ſuffer any of the Elect of God, to hold on and periſh in the faith of any Propoſitions of this nature; for then the elect of God <hi>might be deceived,</hi> which our Saviour hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <hi>impoſſible;</hi> then a Soul ordained to Life, given to Chriſt, might periſh eternally; which is not conſiſtent with the certainty of Divine Purpoſes, and infallibility of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Decrees. Although therefore an elect Veſſel may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome ſuch corrupt Liquor, yet it ſhall not, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide in it, though it may be for a time taken in ſuch a ſnare of the Devil; yet the ſnare ſhall be broken, and it ſhall be delivered before it comes to leave the Body. The queſtion onely muſt be concerning a miſ belief of other Propoſitions, a miſ-belief of which is ſinful, but not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>And for thoſe Promiſes of the Spirit leading the People of God into all Truth, and of the <hi>Annointing, teaching them all things,</hi> they muſt be interpreted of ſuch Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions as are neceſſary to be believed in order to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Soul; elſe <hi>ignorance</hi> of other Propoſitions, as well as <hi>Error relating to them,</hi> would argue men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be deſtitute of the Spirit of God, and not to have the Holy Spirit dwelling in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, As to <hi>Propoſitions of Truth,</hi> that are not in this ſenſe <hi>fundamental,</hi> the reaſon of the difference is very obvious, and that both upon a <hi>Natural,</hi> and a <hi>Moral,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> account, Upon, 1. <hi>A ſpiritual account, Diverſe
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:192227:408" rendition="simple:additions"/>Propoſitions of Truth of this nature, are not ſo clearly written in Scripture, that he who runneth may read them.</hi> It was I think <hi>Auguſtines</hi> ſaying of the Holy Scriptures, That there were divers parts of them, in which a <hi>Lamb might wade,</hi> others wherein an <hi>Elephant may ſwim.</hi> It is the great mercy of God to us, that thoſe Propoſitions of Truth, which are neceſſary to be agreed to, in order to the exerciſes of our <hi>Faith</hi> and Holineſs; are left in Scripture <hi>ſo plain,</hi> and ſo often repeated, that if a man will not ſhut his eyes and ſuffer his luſt to give law to his underſtanding, he muſt agree to them; but now divers other Propoſitions are not ſo, but ſo delivered, as that the truth of them is juſtly the ſubject of diſpute; and they are fit for a ventilation, and poſſibly muſt be concluded from conſequences. 2. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>natural account.</hi> Every one hath not the ſame quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Apprehenſion, the ſame ſtrength for ratiocination, and ability for rational and logical deductions. 3. Nor Thirdly (which is that which I meant by a moral account) <hi>Hath every one the ſame helps and means, or capacity to uſe helps and means</hi> to diſcern Truth from Error, and find out what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the Truth, as to a Propoſition laid before him; ſo that although they have all the ſame Spirit of Truth dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them, and the ſame Word of Truth to weigh and meaſure Propoſitions by, yet the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> being no more engaged to keep them from every error of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than from every error of practice; and they not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame faculty to apprehend Truth, nor the ſame means and advantages to underſtand the Mind and Will of God; it is not at all to be wondered if they have not all the ſame Apprehenſion of every Propoſition of Truth: nor is it to be expected that all Chriſtians ſhould have ſo, more than that they ſhould have all the ſame Faces. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Take but the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> concerning <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> I doubt not, no more I think do you that hear me, but that <hi>Infants are to be baptized;</hi> But how do we gather it? We have no expreſs Scripture for that more than for Womens <hi>receiving the Lords Supper;</hi> but we conclude it from the <hi>iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Covenant of Grace</hi> under the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the Precept for <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> from the right of Infants to the Kingdom of God; and many other ſuch
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:192227:409"/>like <hi>Topicks.</hi> But every one hath not the ſame ability of Reaſoning, nor the ſame Apprehenſions of the force of Concluſions; and therefore <hi>different Apprehenſions</hi> in that and ſuch like Propoſitions, is not at all to be wondred at, nor are any to be condemned as not belonging to God for their different Apprehenſions concerning them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, As to the <hi>Act of Providence, permitting theſe different apprehenſions, it cannot</hi> be denied to be an Act ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding reaſonable, and the product of a Depth of Divine Wiſdom. 1. <hi>Reaſonable, That man may act freely according to his nature in the choice, or refuſal of Propoſitions.</hi> 2. The <hi>Product of great Wiſdom.</hi> 1. <hi>For the further confirmation of the Souls of his People in the truth.</hi> It is an uſual ſaying, That there are no Propoſitions, which we more firmly believe, than thoſe about which we have ſometimes doubted. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil magis certum, quam quod ex dubio certumeſt.</hi> Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth a great confirmation, by the ſhakings of ſome Veli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Diſputes about it. It was the ſaying of an eminent perſon of our own Church, <hi>That the itch of diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was the ſcab of the Church;</hi> and truly it hath proved ſo, but it hath been by accident: men coming to diſpute, bringing as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid of his own coming, ſometimes to read the Scriptures, <hi>Diſcutiendi acumen,</hi> not <hi>Diſcendi pietatem;</hi> a ſharpneſs of wit to diſcuſs Points, not an humble pious defire to learn; arguing indeed for maſteries, not for truth; to get themſelves, not to get the truth and glory of God the Victory: but where Diſputes are humbly and meekly managed, there is nothing imaginable of greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſettle and ground the Soul in truth. For after them the Soul gives aſſent to Propoſitions, not as Dictates of others, and Traditions of men, but becauſe it ſeeth certain and unmoveable grounds, upon which they are bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed: and hears thoſe things made to appear of no value, which are objected and can be ſaid to the contrary; and ſo becomes <hi>rooted and grounded in the faith</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh.) Truth yet never loſt in the end by any ſhaking, but hath come out of every field a Conqueror. <hi>Magna eſt veritas, &amp; praevalebit.</hi> It is great and it will prevail at laſt. Different Apprehenſions of Propoſitions, eſpecially when they have been amongſt ſuch as truly feared God, have
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:192227:409" rendition="simple:additions"/>ordinarily cauſed great ſearchings of the Scripture, venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Arguments, and tended much to the furtherance of the Faith; although at preſent they have made but ill founds and noiſes in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Wiſdom of God is much ſeen in permitting theſe <hi>Diverſities,</hi> To convince us that <hi>The Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt: For he that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God and approveable to Men; Rom.</hi> 14.17, 18. It is a great vanity in men to entail <hi>Religion,</hi> yea and the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> too, to a <hi>particular opinion;</hi> yet we are ſo vain, as we ſhould moſt certainly do it, if God by his Providence did not ſo order it that we ſhould ſee many, of whom we cannot ſay but that they fear God, and walk cloſely with him; yea, that they are more righteous than our ſelves, of different opinions and judgments from us in ſome particular things: you cannot but obſerve in the world, how fond and zealous, ſome perſons are for a particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, more than for the great things of Righteouſneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, which are certainly the far more weighty things of the Divine Law; and how warm and zealous, and bitter, men are, more againſt their Brethren, for their differences from them in ſome matters of opinion; wherein if they ſin, yet their ſins proceed from meer infirmity; and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their underſtandings muſt be ſins of the leaſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude (for it is not in the power of man to believe what he will) than againſt thoſe that are open and notorious tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of the Law of God, in things as to which, every man is condemned by his own Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The Wiſdom of God is much ſeen in the permiſſion of theſe different apprehenſions in the Souls of his own People, <hi>In his thus directing us to the exerciſe of charity.</hi> We uſe to ſay, That <hi>Precepts lead us to Duty,</hi> but <hi>Examples draw us.</hi> There is no duty more preſſed upon us in Scripture, than the duty of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Brotherly Love;</hi> nor any to which our hearts, prejudiced by <hi>Pride, Envy,</hi> and <hi>Luſt,</hi> are more awke: the heart of man naturally ſeeks ſome higher ground, on which he may ſtand and triumph over his Neighbour, and be able to ſay in this or that thing I am bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and <hi>God! I thank thee,</hi> I am <hi>not as others are;</hi> amongſt
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:192227:410"/>other things it ſometimes finds an <hi>Opinion,</hi> which it <hi>Chriſtens</hi> with the name of <hi>Orthodox Catholick Truth;</hi> and this ſhall diſtinguiſh him: all that diſſents from him ſhall be <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> or <hi>Ignorant Perſons;</hi> he and his party onely ſhall make up the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> others <hi>know not the Law</hi> (if you will believe him) and <hi>are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</hi> Now though this may prevail very far with men of <hi>Carnal Principles</hi> and <hi>Deſigns,</hi> yet when Gods People ſee, that thoſe who differ in ſome particular opinions from them, yet walk ſo as they dare not but ſay, <hi>God hath loved and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted them: this overcometh their hearts</hi> into their duty. Should not (ſay they) we <hi>love thoſe</hi> whom our <hi>Heavenly Father</hi> loveth? Who are <hi>Sprinkled with the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as well as we; <hi>Juſtified by the Grace of God,</hi> and <hi>Sanctified through the Holy Spirit,</hi> even as we? It were an eaſie thing to aſſign many other things, wherein the Wiſdom of God is apparent in this permiſſion of different Apprehenſions of Truth in the Souls of his own People; as to ſhew <hi>us our weakneſs,</hi> and the <hi>imperfection of our ſtate,</hi> and what need we have to be daily flying to him to <hi>teach us</hi> and to <hi>guide us, &amp;c.</hi> But this is ſufficient, both to have given you a reaſonable account of the thing it ſelf, and alſo of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Providence, in the permiſſion and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it. I ſhall now ſhut up this whole Diſcourſe with a few words more for the practical Application of my whole Diſcourſe upon theſe five laſt Queſtions; which to ſhorten my Diſcourſe I have handled together.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of my whole Diſcourſe is this, That God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his infinite Wiſdom never did, nor yet doth, unto the Souls of his own People, diſpenſe out equal meaſures of Grace. 1. <hi>Strengthening them</hi> to Spiritual Duty. Nor 2. <hi>Quickening them in the performance of it.</hi> 3. Nor <hi>Comforting</hi> and refreſhing their Souls with <hi>the ſenſible conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his ſpirit,</hi> 4. <hi>Nor cauſing them all alike to grow,</hi> nor giving them equal degrees of light to diſcern the truth of Propoſitions of Truth; and then that theſe motions of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence are exceeding <hi>reaſonable,</hi> and God in them is <hi>infinitely wiſe and juſt;</hi> the evidencing of this hath been all my Work: Which I have done from ſeveral Topicks. My whole Application ſhall be reduced to two Heads, ſhewing you how
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:192227:410" rendition="simple:additions"/>uſeful this Diſcourſe may be for the promoting of, 1. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards men.</hi> 2. <hi>Of Piety towards God.</hi> The later is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed firſt in excellency. I have put it in the laſt place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I intend my largeſt Diſcourſe upon it; and with it to ſhut up this whole Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Actual Providence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'This whole Diſcourſe muſt certainly teach us <hi>Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men;</hi> and that particularly toward ſuch as we diſcern, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> 1. <hi>Weak unto their ſpiritual duty.</hi> 2. <hi>More dull and heavy in the performance of it.</hi> 3. <hi>Sad and dejected.</hi> 4. <hi>Not growing ſo faſt in the wayes of God as others.</hi> 5. <hi>That diſſent from our ſelves in ſome matters, opinions, that are not fundamental.</hi> Towards all theſe, we had need of an Exhortation to <hi>Charity.</hi> Cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Judging, are things that are too natural to us; and to which we are too prone. We judge others, and in the mean time forget to judge our ſelves. All this is indeed rooted in a <hi>Natural Pride.</hi> We would fain find ſomething in which we excel others, for that onely will be matter of boaſting and glory to us; but this Diſcourſe may learn us <hi>Charity.</hi> The general argument ariſing from this Diſcourſe is the ſame which the Apoſtle maketh uſe of in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1. He commandeth us to <hi>receive thoſe that are weak in the faith,</hi> though with prudence and caution, <hi>not to doubtful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputations.</hi> His argument is in the latter part of the third verſe; <hi>For God hath received him.</hi> Certainly a very cogent argument. <hi>Thoſe whom God hath received into his favour,</hi> into a fellowſhip and communion with him, no Chriſtians ought to judge, deſpiſe, or reject; but God <hi>receiveth ſuch as are weak in the faith.</hi> It is very abſurd to think that a perſon ſhould be fit for the <hi>favour of God,</hi> and for <hi>fellowſhip with God,</hi> and ſhould not be worthy of, nor fit for fellowſhip with thoſe who are the children and ſervants of God. The ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holds and conſtraineth in all theſe Caſes which I have been opening to you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Seeſt thou therefore one, <hi>Who is weak unto his ſpiritual duty,</hi> and is often halting and complaining of his weakneſs, he is not able to reſiſt his temptations, nor to get a Victory over his corruptions; the ſons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> are too hard for him. He cryeth out with <hi>David, Iniquities prevail againſt me.</hi> He complains he cannot ſo fix his thoughts upon God, ſo keep up his <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> in God, as he deſireth to do. <hi>Do

God muſt in his Family have Babes as well as grown Perſons. In his Fold he muſt have Lambs as well as Sheep; the <hi>Providence of God</hi> hath ſo ordered it in infinite wiſdom. He accepteth none according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in grace, but according to their truth in grace and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. Remember, that thou alſo wert ſometimes <hi>weak,</hi> and it is by grace if yet thou beeſt more ſtrong; nay thou that art ſtrong, mayeſt again be made <hi>weak.</hi> What art thou if God with-draweth his holy ſpirit from thee? If God let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth looſe Satan againſt thee? Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. endeavoureth to perſwade Chriſtians to a charitable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reſtore ſuch as are fallen, in the ſpirit of meekneſs; conſidering (ſaith he) <hi>thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> See what the Apoſtle ſaith upon this head, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1. <hi>We then that are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak; and not to pleaſe our ſelves. Let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification; for even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, Seeſt thou one that is under a divine deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to the <hi>quickening influences</hi> of the ſpirit of God. He walks in the wayes of God, but he doth not move to them, nor in them, with that alacrity of mind, with that cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and livelineſs of ſpirit, that another doth; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth that his <hi>chariot wheels drive heavily:</hi> He comes to duty, rather as a burthen and task, than with any <hi>ſpiritual pleaſure and delight.</hi> As I ſaid in the other caſe, ſo I ſay in this, if thou canſt add any oil unto his wheels, do, but do not clog them more with thy raſh cenſures and uncharitable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; thou doeſt not know what his ſoul ſuffers, how he already groaneth under this burthen, and is diſcouraged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this diſtemper; and therefore far be it from thee, to add affliction to his affliction. God hath <hi>received this mans ſoul,</hi> if he be ſincere, if he be preſſing after God under this burthen of affliction. God is not onely juſt in theſe diſpenſations of <hi>Providence,</hi> but he is wiſe alſo. Juſt he is, as he by them <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth

                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Seeſt thou a ſoul <hi>walk heavily all the day long,</hi> crying out as <hi>David, Lord wherewith wilt thou comfort me?</hi> He neither liveth in the bright and clear Viſion of God, nor yet in the perfect view of his own ſincerity; he is ſmitten of God and afflicted, and his ſoul <hi>refuſeth to be comforted.</hi> Here again is another object of thy charity, and poſſibly the greateſt object which the whole world affordeth; for there is no ſorrow like the ſorrow of that ſoul that walks heavily all the day long, crying out, <hi>Where is my God become?</hi> I ſhall not be large in perſwading pity and charity for ſuch poor ſouls, for he muſt not have the heart of a man, but of a beaſt, that doth not pity ſouls which are thus afflicted. You have heard, that there are many ſuch ſouls whom yet <hi>God hath received.</hi> God doth not equally diſtribute his diſpenſations of conſolitary grace, to all that truly love and fear him; no not to the ſame ſouls. Judge not anothers <hi>truth of grace</hi> by thy own <hi>joy and peace,</hi> if thy <hi>joy and peace</hi> be truly conſequent to thy believing, and the effect of faith in thy ſoul, and what Chriſt left to his Diſciples, it <hi>will not be conſtant,</hi> it hath not been alwayes the ſame; thou haſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo had thy ſad hours: if there be a difference in degrees, this concludeth nothing againſt thy brother. If therefore thou canſt ſpeak <hi>a word in ſeaſon,</hi> if thou canſt comfort an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with the ſame comfort wherewith thy own ſoul hath been comforted heretofore of God, do it; but judge chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably of thy afflicted brother, upon whom the hand of God under theſe <hi>diſpenſations, lieth very heavily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Seeſt thou another, <hi>whoſe ſoul is not grown and thriven in grace to that degree that thine is;</hi> his habits are not yet ſo confirmed, his joynts not ſo well knit; <hi>exerciſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain thy charity,</hi> if thou doeſt but ſee him <hi>hold on his way,</hi> though thou doeſt not ſee he groweth <hi>ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi>
                     <pb n="730" facs="tcp:192227:413"/>God hath promiſed that he ſhall grow, he hath not promiſed that his <hi>growth</hi> ſhall be viſible unto thee: Remember you muſt give allowance both for the time he hath ſtood in the <hi>Lords Garden,</hi> and alſo for the means which God hath afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him while he hath ſtood there. I obſerve that God judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of men with <hi>allowance for their temptations. Behold</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the Patience of Job.</hi> The patience of <hi>Job? Job</hi> indeed did ſometimes ſhew much patience, but withal he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <hi>eminent impatience:</hi> Witneſs his third Chapter, where you find him curſing the day of his birth; and other parts of his Book, where he wiſheth for death, and complaineth ſeverely of Gods dealing with him; yet (ſaith God) <hi>Behold the patience of</hi> Job. <hi>God meaſured</hi> Job<hi>'s grace with his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> If indeed <hi>Job</hi> had brake out into thoſe great errors and extravagancies of paſſion, not being under high and great temptations, he had ſhewed himſelf very impatient; but the Lord conſiders what temptations were upon his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and conſidering them, he pronounceth holy <hi>Job</hi> a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry patient man. We muſt learn to judge as God judgeth, and particularly as to this point of <hi>growth in grace;</hi> we muſt judge of it according to the means and helps of grace which the perſon hath had, conſidering the <hi>natural temper</hi> of the perſon; as alſo his temptations and afflictions which he hath had to put him back, we muſt ſo judge of his growth and thrift. Poſſibly his circumſtances have been ſuch, as have neceſſitated him, in order to getting bread, to live in a Town, in a Family, where he hath ſcarce ever heard a good Sermon, nor hath had any means of Inſtruction; no good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to go before him, and quicken him in the ways of God. Poſſibly he hath walked in the dark and ſeen no light, his life hath been a life of many afflictions, great temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; thou haſt lived where thou haſt had a great plenty of ſpiritual food, all imaginable means to promote the work of God in thy ſoul. In ſuch caſes as theſe, thy brother is the object of thy pity and prayers, and all the charitable aſſiſtance thou canſt give him; but by no means of thy cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, This Diſcourſe doth highly <hi>ſolicite your charity,</hi> for thoſe who differ in their <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of ſome <hi>Principles of Religion</hi> from you. And here (if any where) I had need
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:192227:413"/>plead with you for <hi>charity;</hi> for although it be evident, that it is not in the power of a man to believe what he would, but the <hi>aſſent</hi> of the mind to a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be according to the evidence of the truth of the thing which his underſtanding hath; yet it is matter of amazement to conſider, what Feuds, what Alienations in Affection, are the products of <hi>Differences in Opinion:</hi> As if Heaven were entailed to Underſtandings of one Complexion. There al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes were in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and there alwayes will be, different apprehenſions in ſome matters of Truth; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they have brought forth diſorders (great diſorders) in mens practice; each one hugging his particular opinion, as if he judged himſelf, and none but himſelf, <hi>infallible:</hi> And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> declaiming againſt an <hi>Infallible Head</hi> upon the Earth, will yet arrogate an Infallibility of Judgment unto themſelves. When as nothing is more demonſtrable, than that my brother hath as much reaſon to quarrel with me for differing from him, as I have to quarrel with him for his <hi>differing from me;</hi> unleſs he will ſay, <hi>I cannot be deceived, but you may;</hi> which would give a juſt foundation for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of that old queſtion of the falſe prophet, <hi>Which way went the ſpirit of God from me to thee?</hi> Doth any one ſay I have Scripture for my Opinion? So ſaith the other. Doth he ſay, <hi>I think I am verily perſwaded of it by the ſpirit of God?</hi> So ſaith the other. Doth he ſay, <hi>But I have divers learned and good men of my mind?</hi> Truly there are not very many differences of any moment, but his brother may ſay the ſame. Will he ſay, <hi>But the Church wherein I live is of my mind.</hi> Be it ſo, this indeed ſhould much regulate ſober Chriſtians, as to the publiſhing and divulging of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the diſturbance of others; but it ought neither to rule <hi>Faith,</hi> nor to guide <hi>private Practice.</hi> If it doth, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, which all confeſs fallible, is made the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Supreme Judge</hi> of it; neither of which it can be. What mean therefore theſe <hi>heats?</hi> The Queſtion is ſtill about a <hi>Judge</hi> in the caſe, <hi>Whether a mans particular conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt not be the proximate rule of his actions?</hi> If it muſt not, what muſt? We have loſt the very Baſis of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion,</hi> and ſhall whether we will or no be ſorced to <hi>Rome</hi> to find an <hi>Infallible Judge;</hi> and when we have done
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:192227:414"/>that, we have but cheated our own ſouls; for he is not to be found there: though one may indeed be found that arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates that Title, and to whom credulous Proſelytes give it. How much better is it to ſtay at home, and act according to that excellent <hi>Canon</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded; and if in any thing you be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal this unto you.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Golden Rule, <hi>Whatſoever you would that others ſhould do unto you, the ſame do you unto them again;</hi> if it were well ſtudied by Chriſtians, would put an end to all their little bickerings upon this ſcore; to all their prejudices one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another; all their uncharitable Judgings and Cenfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of one another; all their eagerneſs againſt and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions one of another. One thinks the Government of the Church ſhould be by <hi>Prelates,</hi> another by <hi>Presbyters,</hi> a third by <hi>Common Suffrage.</hi> Suppoſe all theſe agreed in this, that <hi>without faith and holineſs no man ſhall ſee God.</hi> Let every one walk in this way, they will at laſt meet in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> One thinks <hi>Children</hi> ſhould <hi>be baptized,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thinks, <hi>that none ought to be baptized, till he be capable of inſtruction, and making an open profeſſion of faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Yet may both theſe truly receive, embrace, and reſt upon Jeſus Chriſt, as their alone Saviour; their failing is but in a <hi>ſingle point of obedience</hi> (there indeed one of them muſt fail, if they practice according to their principle) but who liveth and ſinneth not againſt God? Who judgeth every ſin in event damnable? eſpecially where the error too is in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of judgment, which a man hath no power to over rule his own Faith and Perſwaſion in; and to practice contrary to what he is perſwaded to be his Duty, were but to play the Hypocrite, to ſin againſt the light of his Conſcience, and interpretatively againſt the Mind of God, and that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p>Miſtake not, the Kingdom of Heaven is not intailed to Parties, but as in every Nation, ſo amongſt all Parties, who ſo believeth in Chriſt, feareth God, and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, is accepted of God. Take heed of embracing Propoſitions which are inconſiſtent with that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> without which none can be ſaved. There is alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>uncomfortable</hi> ſort of Propoſitions; <hi>viz.</hi> Such as who ſo

                     <hi>holdeth</hi> and <hi>practiſeth up to them,</hi> will be obliged to break <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with all or moſt Churches.</hi> And here I muſt lament the unhappineſs of them that are fallen into the miſtake of the Seventh-day-Sabbath, I have known ſome of them, whom I could not but think perſons truly fearing God; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly next to <hi>Errors in Fundamentals,</hi> which will divide a ſoul from the Head <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſuch as divide <hi>from the Body,</hi> are of moſt dangerous conſequence. For the <hi>Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> I make a doubt whether there be any thing (which is not plain in Scripture) which comes to us by <hi>an univerſal tradition</hi> of the Church; but that alone, no conſiderable number of people in any Age of the World ever diſputed it; whence as alſo from the <hi>Scriptural proof</hi> (though raiſed by conſequence for it) there is not this day a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Chriſtians in the World, but do obſerve it, as the <hi>Lords Sabbath,</hi> the ſeventh part of our time, which the Fourth Commandement hath conſecrated: ſo as thoſe under a different perſwaſion in this thing, are under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of breaking Communion in <hi>ſolemn</hi> acts of <hi>Worſhip</hi> with all Churches; and this is very ſad and uncomfortable. Study to be rooted and grounded in every Truth, though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Propoſition of Truth be not of that value, as to break Unity and Peace for, yet there is not any but is worth ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inquiring after: but if after all you cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to your Brethrens Opinions, nor yet reconcile them to yours; learn, according to the Apoſtles Precept, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, to ſpeak, to contend for, to hold the Truth in love, and to be charitable to thoſe whom you may diſcern of different perſwaſions and apprehenſions from you. God (as I have ſhewed you) doth in great wiſdom permit theſe different apprehenſions in his people. God may have <hi>received thoſe</hi> that ſo differ, do you receive them becauſe God hath received them. Thus I have ſhewed you, how my fore-going Diſcourſe may be uſeful to you for the <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may alſo be uſeful to you for the <hi>improvement of your pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> and that divers wayes: 1. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> To <hi>teach you to adore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom in theſe different diſpenſations of his providence.</hi> You cannot underſtand why God ſuffereth ſome of his people to be <hi>weak,</hi> weak <hi>in faith,</hi> weak as to their <hi>ſpiritual habits and
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:192227:415"/>exerciſes,</hi> you think God might have more glory if they were ſtronger, and their habits were more confirmed; which is certainly true, as to the actings of thoſe particular perſons; the more ſtrong any one is in faith, the more confirmed he is in the habits of holineſs; the more undoubtedly that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon would glorifie God: but the <hi>Government,</hi> as of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſouls, ſo of <hi>the whole Church, is upon Chriſts Shoulders.</hi> And in the government of his providence he ſo adminiſtreth the affairs of particular ſouls, as he may have the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the whole. Beſides, God ordinarily <hi>governs his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> not by miraculous operations, but by <hi>ordinary reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means.</hi> Which two things being ſuppoſed, Gods infinite wiſdom appears, in the different ſizes and ſtatures of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in their different ſtates and complexions. Every one hath that meaſure of grace and knowledge, which beſt ſuiteth the good of the whole Body of his Church; which as the body natural hath different members, and thoſe of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent uſes; and muſt be ſo diſpoſed, as ſhall render them moſt ſerviceable one to another, and the whole moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the great deſign of Gods glory. Let us not therefore trouble our ſelves, in diſputing the equity and reaſonableneſs of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> in its motions; for though we cannot by ſearching, find out the Almighty unto Perfection: yet you ſee there is no ſuch variety in Gods Diſpenſations of this nature, but a reaſonable account may be given of it. And as to theſe Diſpenſations, it will appear at the laſt, that thoſe who have leaſt ſhares of this <hi>hidden manna,</hi> will have no lack of enough to bring them to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and thoſe who have the greateſt portions of it, will find they have nothing over.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But in the ſecond place, <hi>This Diſcourſe affords a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to promote holineſs in all our ſouls.</hi> The ſubject of my Diſcourſe hath been not the diſpenſations of <hi>the firſt grace,</hi> but Gods <hi>further manifeſtations unto the ſouls of his people.</hi> And you have heard it given, as one reaſon of Gods variety in the Diſpenſations of them; That <hi>ſome ſouls walk more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with God, are more afraid to offend him, and more careful to pleaſe him than others are.</hi> For though the ſoul, as to the <hi>Reception of the firſt grace,</hi> be <hi>meerly paſsive;</hi> yet as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of theſe manifeſtations in the ſeveral degrees of
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:192227:415"/>them, it is many ways <hi>Active.</hi> All therefore that I have to do, is to call upon you to <hi>perfect Holineſs,</hi> and to ſhew you what <hi>force</hi> there is <hi>in this Argument,</hi> to ingage you to it. <hi>Holineſs</hi> is a great General, comprehending what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is the Duty of Man purſuant to the Will of God: All Duties both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> fall under the Motion of it, as well Acts of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> towards Men, as Acts of <hi>Devotion</hi> towards God; yea, and not Acts onely, but even ſecret Thoughts, and thoſe powers and habits of the Soul, which are the Principles of ſuch Acts. When I therefore upon this account, call upon you to <hi>perfect Holineſs,</hi> my meaning is, that you ſhould ſtudy that perfection of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Duty,</hi> which God requires of you; but for the ſake of thoſe that are weaker, and becauſe there are ſome pieces of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which do more properly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately trend towards the reception of theſe gradual mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations, and the <hi>omiſsion</hi> of which may in a more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar and ſpecial manner, hinder the reception of them, and provoke God to deny them; let me open this general in ſome few particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>Take heed of all wilful ſinning,</hi> for if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the with-drawings of theſe Divine Influences, as <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of ſin,</hi> as undoubtedly ſometimes they are, it is hard to ſay what <hi>wilful ſinning</hi> God may not thus puniſh. <hi>Davids</hi> ſins of <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> were acts of <hi>unright ouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> towards men, yet God puniſhed them in this manner, as we may gather from his penitential <hi>Pſalms;</hi> there is no ſort of ſin that I know but may for a time <hi>ſeparate</hi> betwixt <hi>God and the Soul,</hi> and make him to <hi>hide his Face from it.</hi> That Chriſtian therefore, that would have theſe manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of God unto him, theſe abidings of the Holy Spirit with him, muſt be Holy in all manner of Converſation, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a reſpect to all Gods Commandements, as well thoſe of the ſecond Table as thoſe of the firſt. Conſcience may check and reflect ſourly upon the ſoul for any of them, and where that doth ſo reflect and check, there will be little <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> little <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> unto duty, little <hi>Growth</hi> and <hi>Progreſs</hi> in the <hi>Ways</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> Herein there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exerciſe your ſelves, to keep a Conſcience <hi>void of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> both towards God and towards men; to keep your ſelves from all <hi>filthineſs,</hi> both of <hi>fleſh and ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="736" facs="tcp:192227:416"/>2. Secondly, In a more particular manner, take heed of all <hi>earthy mindedneſs;</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Love not the World nor the things of the World; if any man love the World the love of the Father is not in him:</hi> v. 16. <hi>For all that is in the World, the luſt of the Eyes, the luſt of the Fleſh, and the pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the World.</hi> Pleaſure, Profit, Honour, is all that the World can afford any man. A man given up to the purſuit of pleaſure, or of worldly profits and advantages, or worldly honours and preferments, ſcarce can have any true love for God; and the promiſe of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation,</hi> is made to him that loves God and keeps his Commandments. The Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>That to be carnally minded is death, but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace.</hi> A carnal mind doth not onely bring a Soul to <hi>eternal death,</hi> in the laſt iſſue of it, but it puts a great death upon his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> I mean his <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> It is impoſſible that the Soul that is intangled in the buſineſſes of the World, in a more than ordinary manner, ſhould find his Soul either ſo free for, or ſo ſtrong in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of ſpiritual duty, as that Soul who hath leſs of the cares and buſineſs or concerns of the world upon it. The Soul of a Man is not infinite in its powers, and cannot be with equal degrees of intention, employed upon two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, much leſs contrary things. While we are in the world, we muſt be converſing with the men of the world, and handling the things of the world; we muſt elſe (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the caſe of converſe with ſinners) <hi>Go out of the world:</hi> but the leſs the Soul is ingaged in them, the leſs the Heart is ſet upon them, and its intention, and affections taken up with them; therefore it will be more free as to its ſpiritual buſineſs, and ſtronger in the performance of it. Let every one therefore learn that excellent leſſon of the Apoſtle; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30. <hi>Let thoſe that have Wives, be as though they had none; and they that weep as though they wept not; and they that rejoyce as though they rejoyced not; and they that buy as they that poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this world as not abuſing it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Be diligent in waiting upon God in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his publick worſhip, and conſciencious in ſuch attendance.</hi> The <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Word of God is the great Ordinance of
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:192227:416" rendition="simple:additions"/>God for perfecting the Saints, both as to their <hi>number,</hi> by the work of Converſion, and as to <hi>their graces;</hi> by giving out further meaſures and manifeſtations of himſelf to his peoples Souls; he createth the <hi>fruit of the Lips peace.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians therefore, who wait for theſe influences, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to wait upon the Lord in his own way. It was Gods ancient promiſe, <hi>That whereſoever he recorded his name to dwell, there be would meet his people and bleſs them:</hi> And conſidering that although the bleſſing of Grace doth not depend upon the Inſtrument; let <hi>Paul plant,</hi> and <hi>Apollos Water,</hi> God muſt give the increaſe; and he that planteth is nothing, nor he that watereth any thing; yet God deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with reaſonable Souls, uſeth to deal with them in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable wayes. I do not think it enough for Chriſtians to go to Church and hear Diſcourſes out of Pulpits, but to wait upon God under ſuch Preaching of his Word, as may appear and approve it ſelf to them, as having a <hi>rational ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, to the improvements of their Soul in Grace.</hi> There are kinds of Preaching, under which a Chriſtian may ſit long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before he find his Soul quickened or ſtrengthened, or improved by them. You may remember I gave you that as one reaſon, why ſome receive more gradual manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Divine Love</hi> than others, becauſe they have <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter means</hi> than others have, or make a better uſe of means than others do. I take a conſciencious uſe of the more external means, to lie much in three things: 1. <hi>In a good election of them.</hi> 2. <hi>In a ſincere and diligent attendance upon them.</hi> 3. <hi>In an after repetition of them to our ſelves, and a more private application of them to our own hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay firſt in a good <hi>election</hi> of them. Though <hi>Preaching of the Word</hi> be the general means, yet the <hi>Preacher</hi> and way of <hi>Preaching,</hi> makes a vaſt difference in this means; and the concurrence of God to all the purpoſes of Grace is upon experience found to be evidently more; where the means appear in the eye of reaſon more proper. If the Preacher ordinarily preacheth not to the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>capacity</hi> of the hearer, or not <hi>to the conſcience and hearts of hearers,</hi> but fills up his time with other things, imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Souls Spiritual Duty; or wraps up his Duty in ſuch Parables and Myſteries of <hi>Phraiſe</hi> and <hi>Abſtruſeneſs</hi> of Notions,
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:192227:417"/>that the hearer can make nothing of it; he can have little hope to profit by it, and he will ſhew little conſcience in attendance upon them. Our Saviour, you know, gives this account, why he ſpake to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Parables;</hi> but to his Diſciples opened thoſe <hi>Parables</hi> and ſpake more plainly and intelligibly. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.13, 14. <hi>Therefore ſpeak I to them in Parables; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they in ſeeing ſee not, and in hearing bear not, neither do they underſtand; and in them is fulfilled the Prophecy of the Prophet</hi> Iſaias, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but v. 16. <hi>Bleſſed are your Eyes, for they ſee; and your Ears, for they hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, In a <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>diligent attendance upon them.</hi> That Soul which will meet God in his Ordinances, muſt <hi>in hearing hear;</hi> he muſt go out with a deſign to meet God, and he muſt <hi>hoc agere,</hi> while he is waiting upon God. Our Saviour asks his Diſciples, when they had been hearing <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, What they went out for to to ſee?</hi> It is a queſtion we ſhould all propound to our ſelves, when we go to wait upon God in his Ordinances: Now <hi>what doth my Soul go out for to do;</hi> what is its end in this motion? God ordinarily meeteth his People, according to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their deſigns; which indeed maketh their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances upon God, <hi>ſeekings,</hi> or <hi>not ſeekings</hi> of Gods Face.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It lies <hi>in a practical application and whetting the Word hard upon our hearts and conſciences.</hi> This is the digeſting of the Word; this now is a piece of Holineſs of great import, to thoſe that ſeek after the further manifeſtations of God, and higher meaſures of Grace; any growing, whether it be in <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Love.</hi> Nor is the Reading andPreaching of the Word onely to be attended, but the <hi>Holy Sacraments</hi> alſo; <hi>Baptiſm</hi> (which we have generally received in our Infancy) to be improved: And the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper</hi> to be conſcienciouſly attended. There is a great improvement to be made of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in order to our <hi>Spiritual Strength</hi> and <hi>Vigour:</hi> I have handled that in a particular Diſcourſe in ſome of your hearing, and muſt not now enlarge upon it: it is our great error that we make no more uſe of our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> than we do. The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. draweth great arguments from it to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> us unto Holineſs. The <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper,</hi> is called (by the Apoſtle) <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:192227:417" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Body and Blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The meaning of that I do not underſtand, if it doth not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, That it is an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> wherein (if it be duly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly attended upon) Chriſt doth communicate the <hi>vertue of his death.</hi> Now I am ſure all Chriſts mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations to the Souls of his People, are a part of that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. It is true, it doth not neceſſarily work theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, nor is God bound neceſſarily in this manner, to concurre with it; he is a <hi>free agent</hi> in all his effluxes of Divine Grace, but yet theſe are Holy Inſtitutions, upon which he hath recorded his name, and we are bound in order to our receptions of his Grace, to lie at theſe Pools.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be much, fourthly, in <hi>Prayer,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>ſecret Prayer;</hi> there it is that the Soul can be freeſt with God, both in the <hi>confeſſion of its ſins, and in the ſpreading of its particular caſe before the Lord,</hi> and wreſtlings with him. All that is to be obtained of God, either with reference to the <hi>firſt Grace,</hi> or the further manifeſtations of God unto the Soul, is in one place or other of Holy Scripture promiſed unto Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Let not <hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>Holy Conference</hi> be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. <hi>Meditation</hi> is the ſouls <hi>Soliloquy with God,</hi> a piece of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety often commanded and practiſed with great ſucceſs. <hi>Holy converſe and conference,</hi> is our converſation with Saints, who are to meet often together, to conſider, and to provoke one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>to love and to good works.</hi> Converted ſouls, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. have an obligation upon them <hi>to ſtrengthen their brethren.</hi> Men of knowledge do not only themſelves <hi>increaſe in ſtrength</hi> for their own uſe, but they <hi>increaſe ſtrength</hi> in others; as Gods <hi>inſtruments,</hi> for the principal efficiency of <hi>ſpiritual ſtrength</hi> is from the Lord. <hi>Converſe alſo with the people of God</hi> is of great uſe to <hi>increaſe spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life</hi> and <hi>vigor,</hi> as one <hi>coal</hi> kindleth another; and oft-times God maketh uſe of his more <hi>private ſervants,</hi> to ſpeak <hi>a word in ſeaſon</hi> to the weary in ſhort for all the <hi>purpoſes of ſpecial grace.</hi> I ſhall add no more, for the promiſe of <hi>divine manifeſtations,</hi> and the <hi>abode of the ſpirit of God</hi> with the ſoul, being limited to thoſe <hi>who love Chriſt,</hi> and evidence <hi>that love</hi> by a <hi>keeping of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements;</hi> it muſt neceſſarily follow, <hi>that the keeping the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of Chriſt in all things,</hi> muſt be an adequate means; and indeed all that lieth <hi>upon our hand to do,</hi> in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of theſe <hi>manifeſtations.</hi> Now what greater argument to
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:192227:418"/>
                     <hi>preſs holineſs</hi> can there be than this? <hi>He that hath my commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and keepeth them</hi> (ſaith our bleſſed Lord, <hi>John</hi> 14.21.) <hi>he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf unto him.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>If a man love me he will keep my words, and my Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> Who is there that underſtandeth not the difference betwixt a <hi>ſtrong</hi> and a <hi>weak</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>weak</hi> in the <hi>reſiſtance of ſin and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> weak in <hi>the performance of all holy</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual duties:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> who feels himſelf in a free lively temper for the ſervice of God, ready to run the way of Gods Commandments, and a <hi>dull, heavy, uncheerly temper</hi> for duty; while in the mean time the conſcience is preſſed with a neceſſity of doing of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a <hi>ſad, dejected, diſquieted,</hi> troubled ſpirit, and a ſoul full of that joy and peace that is conſequent to believing? betwixt a ſoul flouriſhing and daily ſhooting forth, in more perfect acts of grace, and a ſoul that ſeems to ſtand ſtill, and not to thrive in the wayes of holineſs? If therefore there be any advantage from further degrees of <hi>ſpiritual ſtrength,</hi> if any goodneſs in a <hi>ſpiritual livelineſs, freedome, and alacrity,</hi> if any <hi>conſolation in Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> ariſing from thoſe <hi>conſolations,</hi> if any <hi>comfort in the love,</hi> the <hi>ſpiritual love of God?</hi> O ſtudy <hi>Holineſs,</hi> ſome gradual neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of it are the greateſt cauſes of all that <hi>weakneſs, dulneſs, ſadneſs, unthriftineſs,</hi> under which your ſouls labour. God ſometimes acteth by <hi>Prerogative,</hi> ſhewing theſe mercies where he will, and becauſe he will, and with-holding them for the probation and tryal of his People; but generally it is in <hi>juſtice</hi> to puniſh his Peoples <hi>omiſſions of their duty, or commiſſions of ſomething</hi> which is contrary to their duty. And here now I ſhall put an end to my <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> in which I have been exerciſed ſo long, relating to the Providence of God. I ſhall conclude with that of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 26.14. <hi>Lo theſe are parts of his wayes, but how little a portion is heard of him.</hi> To which you may add that, <hi>Job.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching find out God? Canſt thou find out the Almighty unto Perfection?</hi> v. 8. <hi>It is as high as Heaven; What canſt thou do? Deeper than Hell, What canſt thou know?</hi> v. 9. <hi>The meaſure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea.</hi>
